The combat is turn-based which is not my favorite but the game made it look so cool! Although it will get repetitive after a while. The story is the strong part of this game in my opinion. Every planet looks so unique with different puzzles and chests. My biggest complain is about character balance which is not ok at all. Edit: it still has powercreep issue to this day. Every new character is way better than the previous one which pushes players into spending more on the game...,Positive
"The constant grind for materials to activate character traces, ascend units/light cones is not great, and the hunt for relics is beyond time-consuming, a fact that's further driven home by the stamina system. That said, the stories are a great time, environments are gorgeous, and the music is incredibly good (massive props on the Penacony update!). There hasn't been a true lack of missions to take on for the months I've played, something that's pretty wild to me. I'll play for a while longer!",Negative
"I love this game so much. The only mobile game I'd really played before this was Fate: Grand Order, so I was a little intimidated at first, but esp bc it's turn based it's straightforward enough even for a newbie without at all being too simple or easy. The story is incredible, it's so so so good. The character design and variety in kinds of gameplay are some of my favorite things about it, and I have found both the gacha and the game rewards to be quite generous. 5/5 fs highly recommend!!",Positive
"I love this game. It has amazing story and characters, the combat system forces you to really think about team comp and have a good understanding of how characters work together to synergize. The visuals are out standing and I really feel like this is the best hoyoverse game that's currently out. However I feel like the grind of getting materials and leveling and getting better relics can get old after not seeing good relics for weeks at a time (it might just be my luck) as a f2p player",Positive
"Decent game overall. Beautiful character and map design. Good story and music. However, progression resources are very limited for me starting at level 50+, and as a turn based game, there isn't too much to do. However though, the story makes up the lack of gameplay. I can't describe how I much I love the story, the characters, the art, the music. Even if the story is somewhat long, it is fun and interesting enough to keep you engaged over and over and not get bored, unlike some other games.",Positive
"Fantastic game! The story is immaculate and I love all of the character interactions! Characters aren't too hard too get if you put in a lot of effort and rewards are worthwhile! The only issue I have with the game is the amount of storage. Though I come from Genshin, it still takes a lot of storage. My phone has only 64 GB and this takes up more than half. There are many things on my phone I physically can't get rid of and it makes it hard to scour my phone each update for things to delete.",Positive
"Excellent game! It's a little different by the fact that the experience you get is not just by fighting enemies. You get items from fighting certain enemies in certain areas and with these items you build up your characters. As your levels go up the items become more rare. So that is a little different, for me anyway Everything is very creative and not cookie cutter! Very contemporary in its words and actions. If your not used to turn based fighting, you will have to practice! 5‚≠ê So far anyway..",Positive
Retyping a whole new review. Honkai: Star Rail is still a very fun and unique game that I enjoy playing very much. The graphics and art to the game is very appealing to the eye. Especially the lore within it. But it's been a good while now and I still have the same problem form the start where I can't hear any audio from the game unless it's an event from the main story quest. And then the audio just cuts back off completely. I tried everything and I really want to experience the game fully.,Positive
"I love this game! The graphics, characters, voice acting, and story are amazing, and I love the turn-based battle! There's so much lore in the game it's always so interesting. I have mostly good things to say about this game, but my only complaint is that some bosses are too hard. I feel like the game sometimes pressures to have specific characters to complete the story. I do like that there's a past event log tho. Overall amazing game but could make the content easier. Genshin could never",Positive
"It takes a min to play the game... Not so much slow download time, but I think it's all the update files. Takes a min But the reason I have given a two star is because I've tried twice now at the very beginning, after the initial attack the first time you open your data pad it kicks me out... So I can't play it. Has anyone else had this problem and is there a quick fix so I can play the game . Thanks so much an advance for any help I can get!!!",Negative
"This game is very easy to play and control, even on mobile. You don't even need a controller since it's turn-based. The characters, especially the Trailblazer (or Trollblazer) are lovely, expressive and have their own unique quirks and personalities compared to Genshin's roster. This game rewards you very generously with events and doesn't get boring with any content. Though, the enemy designs could use some change. They reuse the same base models for a lot of non-boss enemies.",Positive
"Largely, it's a great game, but the energy system could use an overhaul. 6 minutes to recover one energy with a max of 240, then 18 minutes to recover a single point in the backup reserve. If it's going to take that long, it would make more sense to recover a few energy in the main pool every six minutes and 5-10 energy per 18 minutes in the reserve. Makes it rather difficult and slow to farm Trace materials and relics.",Positive
"SUCH good writing in Penacony. Loved every bit of it, down to each minor side quest. Music is fantastic, story is incredibly cerebral, and visuals are amazing. HSR toes the line between more mature story concepts while retaining an upbeat adventurous spirit to it. Heart-rending and impactful story beats. Each map is a pleasure to explore. Pull rates are good compared to some other gachas, and each update feels very rewarding. :)",Positive
"The story is fantastic and entertaining, the characters are interesting, and it seems like in this game feedback is ACTUALLY heard and QoL changes are made to improve the game. Really love that this doesn't fall into the pitfall that many gacha games do where it's too much of a chore to be f2p and to level characters. It's a good balance that actually keeps the game enjoyable. The music and the storytelling especially in the latest chapter are fantastic; I'm excited to see what comes next!",Positive
"Beautiful game and massive improvements over time I love this game being well-managed if you want the gacha experience or not. I feel like I can get to know the lore of the city and the characters relatively well. I find coming back into farming materials not very hard like some other games. Overall, just know if a desired maxed out build is wanted, it will be a challenge. So far, the artifacts are pretty good even if you don't want to max out the stats in the game. 4.8/5.0, for my opinion",Positive
"I love the game. The game is incredibly well-made. The characters, stories, and cutscenes are truly remarkable. thee quests are quite entertaining. The events and puzzles are also very enjoyable. It appears that some players are having trouble with the quests being somewhat lengthy, so if you want to play this game, you'll need to have some patience. You can also witness how dedicated and diligent they are to the game by visiting their YouTube channel. Regards for reading :)))",Positive
"This game is very fun and there is a ton to do. The biggest problem is the ENDLESS cut scenes. There is no way to get through it and they can be like 10 min with constant tapping to skip!!! All the endless cut scenes make me terrified to trudge through the main story because I'll have a fun 1 min battle, then be punished with a lack of energy and a brutal 15 min of cut scenes. Everything else in this game is amazing though. If you don't suffer from ADHD then it's probably 5 star.",Positive
"a year in and im still loving this game. even on slower days where i just log in to auto farm and log off, it doesn't feel like a slog. endgame is challenging, music is encompassing, characters are compelling, story is (mostly) well-written, the devs actually listen to player feedback and respond in a timely manner- i feel the love that's put into this game, and it allows me to love it right back. looking forward to another year of trailblazing!",Positive
"So far, I'm enjoying the experience, the graphics are like, good good (despite my settings set at the Lowest Graphics). Though one problem i always have is how long it takes to load on my device after pressing ""Press to Play"", which is at exactly 1 minute, 28 seconds and 17 milliseconds, that may not sound long, but it feels like HOURS when you're someone like me. I can understand if it's because of my budget phone but nonetheless, great game overall üëç",Positive
"This game is a huge upgrade to genshin. The story, character design, environment design, events, and especially the music are top tier. Everything that genshin lacked, this game improved on it. Except of course it still doesn't have a skip button but it doesn't really matter since the side quests doesn't really drags you with very long dialogues, it is rather very compact and quick to do. And the story quests really pulls you in and makes you more immersed to the story.",Positive
"Constant regular player for longer than a year. Great game Just one major complaint. Aside from the need of new chars for new mechanics and such which i understand is needed to keep players keep pulling. Previous events take up a lot of space. I wish there was an option where we can install and delete past event resources if and when we want, while keeping the memory of how far we've gotten in them.",Positive
"I've played a few turn-based RPGs but this, masterpiece of a game truly made me love turn based games again. Compelling story, amazing animations, beautiful music, and magnificent character designs. The gameplay is fun with a plethora of characters, each with their own abillities and synergy. The vast amount of teams you can mix and match combined with the artifact system is absolutely endless. Each version brings a new experience to be found with events and story expansions. Truly a masterpiece",Positive
"Love this game, but cutscenes always lag: audio, video, everything is very laggy. My old phone didn't have such an issue, and current phone is better in every aspect. I heard others also compaining about this issue. It's like no matter what phone you have, if you don't specifically do something with your settings it's going to lag so much. And honestly it just messes with overall gaming experience. One second you're involved in storyline, the other you suffer because of smth out of my control.",Negative
"As the game updates, it somehow gets worse. Main quests're just...not clicking anymore. Penacony's unnecessarily long and the ending wasn't satisfying in any way. A lot of stuff to remember the story, too much information. How am i supposed to remember all of those? Plus, the relic rng. I think it is pretty obvious, it has the sh*ttiest system i've ever seen.Three flats with the repeating defense main stat??I need decent relics at least if i cannot get the characters i want. And lag got worse.",Negative
The game is good. I look forward to a story expansion because the end of the current storyline was phenomenal. One thing I want to highlight is ascension material changes. You could be farmimg weekly capped materials for a unit and in the middle of weeks of farming find out that some random ascention mats changed. If I see them change character mats again one more time I'll 1-star this review even if I don't have that unit. There's no reason. That's a game ruiner. I'm surprised I gave it 3.,Negative
"I love this game for many reasons . It's a big step up and break from genshin. It has amazing boss battles with great back music and emotional stories, and lastly, the character designs one thing I really hate, though : that you cant jump climb or fly, as I wish I could explore a bit freely like genshin other than that the game is perfect:)",Positive
"Combat is really hard in the early game but when you reach endgame it should be really easy. the universe challenge should be very easy since you can just use the path of nihility,hunt,erudition to make it easy and for pure fiction just make teams of different play styles like dot,dps,follow up attacks, and super break since the buffs change per version. and finally the last endgame content memory of chaos this mode is a bit easy since all you need is proper understanding and good characters.",Positive
"The game has been great up until the recent update. This review is specifically just dedicated to pointing out a bug that I've experienced, at least currently on my galaxy s23 ultra(the PC version is fine). Currently on divergent universe, protocol difficulty 3, when I'm fighting the deer, the game just crashes during the fight.",Negative
"i love this and been playing for a long time. the problem is that when i try facing Ebon Deer, my screen always freezes and kicks me out of the game. i tried clearing the caches, i tried uninstalling and re install again but i still crashes. please fix this. im trying to look for another game that can replace Star Rail but can't find any. this game is so great that i can't stop playing it. please fix this.",Negative
"Considering its popularity and me having already tried it before, I went back into this game skeptical, expecting to give it a lower score. Yet, the game surprised me with its detail and depth of content. The story is more spectacle than substance, but it is confident in that identity. Gameplay is diverse - one moment you are badass fighter, next you are a puzzle solving explorer, and after that, you are a museum manager, warehouse manager, ghosthunting influencer with unique mechanics to match.",Positive
"I love this game, but it is starting to take way too much storage. I am at level 70, and I completed all the permanent events. Though it's because of those permanent events that have no use for me anymore, I will be forced to delete the game because my device can't hold it anymore. It would be helpful to have an option to delete the completed permanent events that have no greater use when done so I can still play the game in the future.",Negative
"Seems to be full of bugs and lags. (Could be my older phone.)Great graphics. Very complicated. I tapped on the phone icon and I couldn't return to the game. That was the end of it for me, after trying to open for several hours. I am sure it has the makings of a huge cult classic, but for me it is just too complex, too much information when it comes to fighting. Please give it a try for yourself. But for me, there was just too much for me to digest and understand then learn, process and remember",Negative
The game so far is amazing! And the story is so good! I just have one problem and it's the storage... It's too much for phone users and the last update was way too much like- it went from 21 gb to 30+gb??? I deleted everything and still can't finish the update. My opinion is to make phone users choose the quality they want to make the data less. Thank you for reading!,Positive
"I'm upset with the lack of focus on progressing the main story in new updates. Way too much on side quest content. Having Divergent Universe scale 60+ levels is not the new world I was hoping to be able to explore, and is extremely repetitive with little reward aside from the weekly bonus. Farming is becoming very obnoxious. Hoping things improve.",Negative
"This game is awesome!! All of the graphics, rewards, character designs and more. This has to be at least one of the BEST RPG game I have ever played in my entire life. This game is good and all but I have a complaint, When I first started playing HSR I noticed that whenever playing story mode or whenever I fight an enemy, my screen turns black and I get kicked out of the game only to be met with my home screen wallpaper. It has become more frequent when the Pencony update came out. Pls fix this‚ù§",Positive
"Really good game in general. I love it, the story, the characters etc... but one thing ‚Äî No matter on which device I play, except the PC and Laptop, my game is crashing and I don't know why. Sometimes I can't even open the game and sends me back to my homescreen. And it happened already seven times or more in just one month. And it's really annoying to delete all the data and download them all again, and today it happened again! Please fix this!!",Positive
"Honestly one of the best games I've ever played. Great storyline, great designs, great cutscene, lol. I've only started at version 2.1, but the game is amazing. The only problem I have is that I usually finish the missions within 2 or 3 days, and then the game just doesn't have anything more to do. Yes, there are other things you could do (like SU, PF, etc..) but sometimes I just can't complete them üíÄüíÄüò≠ (skill issue ig) but overall this game is pretty fun, keep it up, MiHoyo <3 ü´∂üèº",Positive
My Only complain would 1. Materials weekly boss is locked behind story. It will be difficult for some returning players to maxing out their character. 2. Cutscenes stuttering for no reason. My device completely fine running medium setting with 50-60 fps but I can't even enjoying the cutscenes when it stuttered like every time. Never experienced this with other hoyo games.,Negative
"Super super fun! I love the characters and even though I've usually opted to auto mode for most of my other turn based games, the animations and gameplay feels engaging and fun to play manually as well! The story is solid for the first place, gets shaky in the next stop but don't worry because it's only for a bit- the third place (penacony) is AWESOME and a blast, the story is so good, seriously.",Positive
"I love the story and characters but unfortunately I have to give 1‚òÜ because the game is unplayable when you're epileptic like me. There are options to ""reduce motion"" and ""reduce effects"" but honestly, motion reduction makes things worse because it results in more flashing. I've repeatedly mentioned this on their in-game surveys and feedback but they've shown no intention of ever FIXING IT!! The current options to reduce effects aren't enough, I need them reduced further!!!",Negative
"I really enjoy this game and it's combat and music design. However it is incredibly disappointing to see the lack of variety in skintones for a ""fantasy"" game and the use of cultures for characters like aventurine and boothill without properly portraying the skintones of those races. Until more changes towards diversity has been made I cannot recommend this game.",Negative
"Been playing this game for about a year now, and it's still just as satisfying as it was at the start. The music is good and the story has gotten more interesting! Never been that into turn-based games, but somehow, I still really enjoy the combat in this game. There are free good units, and it's easy to get stellar jades. BUT PLEASE PLEASE GIVE US THE OPTION TO CANCEL ULT IM BEGGING üòî",Negative
"Very fun game. Progression can be done with the free characters the story gives you. Also, by playing the game routinely, you can earn the premium currency for 5*. Turn-based combat adds a little extra decision-making to the game, great music and fun story. UPDATE: This game just keeps getting better. Continuous updates and continuous side-games and features keep getting added. Even if you miss a few time limited event, a lot of side games remain permanently available!",Positive
"If only Genshin was treated as well as HSR... game's great, replayable, treats the playerbase good, plenty of endgame content, and story is good. This is my go-to when I'm on a train or bus, or need to kill 20 mins. Simulated universe and other similar game modes are what really make this game excel, and we keep getting more!",Positive
"In my opinion, this game got all of the things that I want, like immersive storytelling, some cool character design, and generous gacha system (kinda). Not a single problem occurred when I played it, never had a single bug or anything like that. This game deserve 10/10. Also, I personally love Robin :D",Positive
I would really love to give this game 5 stars but I don't really think I can. Seeing that penacony was inspired by jazz times and people was very nice until seeing the playable characters. Sure the characters are all very well designed but I feel that having more diversity in skin tones would've made more sense especially for this mission since the place is based on the jazz era.,Negative
"Fantastic game overall . The story is amazing and changing enough to where is doesnt feel boring , i love how the world's have different architecture and different npcs, I would recommend for hsr to be able to co-op with friends and be able to play together and fight together. But I loved the game regardless",Positive
"There is not enough content in the game that is not tied to combat end game. You can finish an entire patch worth of content in the first 2 weeks of patch. There is no sense of need to longin to the game after you, complete the trailblazer quest. We also don't get enough fuel and not enough 4 stars. The autoplay is great, and penacony quest was great. But please give us more events or quests or even more things for us to look at other parts of a maps. Also, there is lack of skin diversity.",Negative
"The game is great. I thought to give 5 stars at first, then when I faced a problem I thought abput giving 4 stars. However, The problem caused the game to stop functioning, so I can't really give any stars while I can't play the game in the first place. In the xianzhou alliance arc, When I faced the ""Abundant Ebon Deer"" for the second time, the game crashes the moment I reach phase II with it. That happened 4 times now (I tried to clear cache, clean my ram and restart my device, nothing worked)",Negative
My favorite game from Mihoyo. I've been playing literally every day since launch week and while I have spent money on this game the amount of in-game currency you get is pretty stellar ;) and despite not spending much I have a full roster of characters just from playing regularly. The combat is fun and the visuals are stunning. I look forward to every new story patch and event.,Positive
"It's just too good. The difficulty, the team building, the music is so well balanced, story is top notch on parts 2 and 4 and the characters are so well designed both in combat and Aesthetics.. Best hoyoverse game now",Positive
"I love this game, and the fighting style of the characters its so cool it's definitely easier than genshin, and it's easier to get characters, and the animation for the characters' abilities are awesome.",Positive
"I really enjoy the game.I've never really played turn-based games, but HSR has been really fun. The characters are also really fun and well designed. Not many gotcha games cater to females (or just people attracted to males) so the equality in new male characters is nice. The new games modes have also been good at adding variety for all players, especially the newest one. You can also get through the story pretty easily if you want.",Positive
I love the story and the gameplay. The characters were all unique in their own way. The game rarely was too challenging for me . It took me at least 2 or 3 tries before I brat the boss. The voiceless are also really clean and fitting for each character.,Positive
"From my perspective on this turn based game is actually quite fun overall especially I'm very enjoyed their character ultimate smooth animation whenever activate it. However, it's kinda unusual whenever I started the story or play games with my mobile device is already overheating in a few minutes ago which is frustrating to me.",Positive
"This game is a total blast! The graphics are absolutely stunning, with beautifully detailed characters and environments. The combat system is a real standout, allowing you to seamlessly switch between other characters and execute amazing combo attacks. As an avid RPG fan, I have to say this game exceeds all my previous favorites. The level of polish and depth of gameplay is simply above and beyond. Hats off to the talented developers who put their heart and effort creating this game!",Positive
"Been playing about a week now. I will update my review as I play more. Using a S24 Ultra to play. So far this game is mind-blowing. Graphics and style 5/5. Voice acting is 5/5, Combat is 4/5 only because for me it is a lil difficult to understand want elements are strong/weak against what. The break/stun system is great but a bit confusing to understand what element is going to be better for causing the effect. And maybe an auto-travel to objective would be nice as well. Not enough space for mor",Negative
"Overall amazing game, arguably the best gacha in existence. BUT....yes, but, artifact farming requieres a tweak. Like seriously, farming these things to be able to use my units is literal hell. I just got a piece for my Firefly, after 2 long weeks of farming, with just 1 useless stat...guess what. It went HAM on this stat, rendering the piece absolutely worthless. We need more options for artifacts, such as reward artifs with preset stats, ways to roll out a worthless stat for another, or reset.",Negative
Extremely well thought out. Very fun!!!! The animation is absolutely extraordinary.If you love turn based combat this is the perfect game for you.You can F2P but I loved it enough to buy! Hope y‚Äôall love it as much as I do!Edit: after they added the new character Acheron I have been having an absolute blast forever!Another thing is that even 4 star characters are viable for endgame content.My favorite 4 star can keep up with the dps's. Would recommend to anyone with enough storage.,Positive
"the game is really good, let me explain. HSR has really good plot, especially the penacony part, it was peak. There are a lot of ways to obtain rewards needed in order to obtain characters (gacha), like exploration, amazing quests and events - which you can also access as a new player. There is a lot to do, even if you are late player, and the game overall is fun to play. Mc (us) is super funny and chaotic. Its really a great game",Positive
"I've been playing this game since ver. 1.0 came out, and I did have a little break which i regret now. The story is truly amazing, with every patch we get new story quest, i feel even more satisfied with lore (coming from a person with lore obsession). The turn based combat is also good in my opinion, at least once you understand what's even going on. Ultimates or skill animations are also very good. The exploration is not too hard, and rather chill and enjoyable for casual players.",Positive
"Absolutely amazing game. I've been playing since sometime in October, and this game has an addicting quality to it that keeps me in. The characters are all so different and distinctive, with amazing designs. I love the style, and cut scenes are so amazing with their animations. This is the first game I've played by Hoyoverse, and I'm not disappointed. The hype is justified by the amazing characters, story, and scenery. Never loved a game more. Definitely recommend this game!",Positive
"This game is really fun to play. I really do recommend it. But when you get more in the game, you have more missions and they sometimes get harder. Also you have to level up your characters really well to defeat some of the battles you when you get more into the game. But overall the game is really fun and exciting and I love to play it on my free time. (When you get more in the game there's cool surprises you can see.)",Positive
Honestly the one of only issues is that jumping is not possible which is sad BUT the game gives very nice experience and story that is full of plot twists. Although at the start of the game the plot in Hertas space station and Belebog isn't the best and this places aren't really fun to explore (which is only my opinion). Still the story there here is good enough to give good experience and the game is worth a shot. Another issue is storage - a lot of people donnt have enough storage to play.,Positive
"This game is ok I'm not much of a turn based gamer but it's worth playing. My complaint actually has to do with one of their other games Zenless Zone Zero I can't make a comment there so I'm doing it here. But device is incompatible with this version really? Bruh I've been waiting to play this for so long and my phone can play all your other games no prob. Games I can play no prob Genshin , Honkai , Star rail , withering waves , punishing grey raven. Bruh I wanna play ZZZ üò≠",Negative
"Good game with even greater story and world, the terminology can get out of hand at some points but that's to be expected from a sci fi fantasy game. I enjoy the turn based combat and and the unique characters that make this game more interesting. However my only complaint is that this game has some power creeping problems, especially in newest area were doing 200k deals half of the bosses health.",Negative
This is a wonderfull game I ever play. It got a good story line and the characters design is really looking good. The battle system is what I like the characters skill animation and voice are all in the flavor. The gacha is the my favorite part especially when you are at 50/50 chance feels like you gonna get a heart attack. A great game keep it up!,Positive
"Great storytelling, Incredible quality, and helps new players understand how to play. It comes with a lot of bonuses when you log in to every update! PS. I would love if you could optimize the game so I could also play ZZZ when it comes out.",Positive
"The combat where you can set it on automatic battle mode is definitely what I am looking for as you can do different things while you are playing. Despite the fact that I find the game content's overwhelming, it is undeniably good for those who are looking for end-game contents. Also looking forward to the main plot. Kudos to the developers!",Positive
"Amazing game. The story is BEUTIFL with amazing representation, from the different races to LGBT. The play style is intriguing and difficult, which builds pleasure from devolping your teams and beating each level. The semi open world experience is also telling, with the senec views and beautiful moments, I can't help but find myself lost in though when just opening the game. The characters have beautiful designs any unique personalities that draw me in. (PLEASE GIVE ME FIREFLY PLEASE)",Positive
"One of the best turn-based Gaccha games I have ever played! The care that de Team has for this game is trully seen in the characters design, background story, voice acting and mechanics. The environment is rich and completely worth exploring. The pacing is good and not too much time consuming (which is great for a working mom like myself). I trully adore the characters and the story so far, and the free rewards are plenty. I just purchased the monthly pass to further support the team. AMAZING!!",Positive
"It's a really amazing game with experimental routes from time to time with a great story and characters. It has a fun ost and a great past time game for those who are into RPG and similar concepts to final fantasy games. Though, it gets a tad bit repetitive after countless fights and my rng must really suck because I can hardly get a good relic which makes me lose interest due to frustrations and burnout. Overall, It's a good game but I'm not the biggest fan of turn based games.üò≠",Positive
"I suppose to give this a 5 star's but due alot of glitches like flickering map almost every one of it but first glance on my playthrough every thing seem fine at first even second launch until the 3rd launch there is amount of flickering around the map consider there is a bid lag and pls fix these environments flickering around the maps. Overall, it was really good. I appreciate the dev and the team effort to this. there is no pressure on fixing some bugs. Sorry about my English grammar anyway.",Negative
"I love this game a ton, I wish I had more time to play it too, but recently I've had to uninstall a handful of my apps to fit this game and while worth it, I still think its unnecessarily large. I hope something can help it just take up less storage because my phone cannot handle another update and sadly I will have to remove the game. Otherwise I find the game amazing but I think a few things are just confusing but I find it easy to play even without understanding much.",Negative
"It's a great game. The characters, story, music, and game mechanics are all amazing. There is one thing I really hate, most of the events are the same, and they take up so much time. There are some events that are really fun, but they don't last long or not much content. It's really annoying. If you don't really mind those types of things, then you should download the game! There's a lot of cool stuff you will enjoy :)",Positive
"Compelling imersive visually and audibly beautiful with whimsical side quests. Reasonably free to play‚Äêable. (Good f2p value) The downside is that it is an over 22gb download by the 3rd act (world), and this is a cosmic train. I dont forsee having enough room to finish it. This just isn't my favorite gameplay to give up 22gb. I dread launching it for the massive updates. I'm willing to chance finding a game more my interest while I play my 2 to 7gb games.",Positive
"If you remember the Muppet Show, say it with me: ""Trains in S-P-A-A-A-C-E!"" The art is gorgeous. The main combat is turn-based (great for people like me who don't do well w/ quadruple bucky button mashers. There are different play modes beside combat. Lots of depth to the content, including associated media. Yes, it's a gacha. No whaling required, although I do support w/ monthly supply pass. I've been happy with my journey aboard the Astral Express. May the warps be ever in your favor!",Positive
"Edit : After playing this game for a year, well even though i frequently lose my 50/50 and 75/25, i need to pull 160 times to get a limited character, and during one time really wanted to quit because of terrible luck. Well at least in the end, because of careful planning to which character should i pull, it becomes a bit more bearable to play this game. And not to mention that, at least i have my reason to play this game because of Firefly and Ruan Mei. In the end, thank you for everything.",Positive
"I love this game. The graphics are just amazing. But there is one problem. I have completed the sensitive beings' mission, but I have not obtained Arlan. I dont know if it is a glitch or something, but i wish it were fixed. But other than that, I love the battilling style and the smooth graphics and the storyline. But even when I have done multiple 10 warps, I don't get a 4 star character.",Negative
"I love this game. I've been playing it for a few months now. The story and the artwork is awesome. But has one huge flaw. I want to play it on ps5 but it won't let me sync my psn with my current mobile star rail account. I have no intention of starting all over. If I cannot successfully transfer my mobile hoyoverse that's synced with my Google to ps5 by syncing psn then I won't play it on ps5. It's a bummer. review would be 5 stars if they let us sync It through psn app, and the actual console",Negative
"The overall story is very fascinating. The combat feels phenomenal and very chill. Also the characters, they all are very unique and have really cool designs. The backstory for the characters are also chef kiss. After playing for 1 year I can say for sure that this game is pure perfection.",Positive
"It's really pretty and well-made, but the gameplay itself isn't fun. 97% of the game is menu navigation and dress-up walking simulator. If you're into micromanagement and really like the characters you may enjoy it. The gameplay itself is nothing more than navigate character through tunnel to objective, click to start a fight, then the most basic of basic turn based combat. Then you spend 3x as long clearing notifications, then repeat.",Negative
"Other than losing every 50/50 (I lost 5 in a row with everything on hard pity and getting the guarantee on hard pity as well), up to the writing of this review, the game is great. Good graphics, mobile optimization and ping. Great story and content, although endgame could use some work. Because of my somehow bad rng, even with most relics, the game just feels like a chore, wherein I put in all the effort just to get nothing in return. Its sad because I loved playing but now it just a stressor.",Negative
"The game becomes more of a chore the longer you play... Do new quest/event, get resources, spend resources trying to get the new character, then you don't always get the new character = months of savings gone. Even as a spender, the feeling of going bankrupt while getting nothing worthwhile in return is devastating. Gear system is another disaster, 10+ resins used and gear is still trash, why screw players over with your non-sense RNG when you can easily do something about it, nothing but greed.",Negative
Amazing turn base RPG. Probably the best mobile game I've played in years. The character design and skills are all unique that it creates for a diverse game play. The storyline is very rich and engaging with many different puzzles during the adventure.,Positive
"It's an amazing game! The graphics are amazing, the story is 10/10 and overall its a good game. I would recommend, you can get warps easily and not have to spend 6 hours just to get a warp. The character designs are top tier, I love the character designs. They really put thought into this game.",Positive
"Downloads are too big. This game started out fun, but every new content added is worse and worse. More puzzles and funky mechanics. It is just no longer fun. It feels like a chore instead of something fun. Also, I only have two games on my phone. This one and genshin and my phone can no longer hold both because this game is too large. Too bad this game is going downhill.",Negative
"Fun game, I enjoyed playing it, but very data consuming. I had to delete more than half of the apps on my phone just to download, and then it updated so I had to delete EVEN MORE. Fortunately for me, I have a tablet I could download it on instead but not everyone can.",Negative
"I like the game very much, but it has problems with the optimization. The third face of the dear boss is like they wanna kill my cellphone, not my team. Also have some audio bugs in the cinematic, if the first example wasn't too frustrating I gave it five star",Negative
"Im not really into gacha games, and especially here the prices are extortionate, but you can pretty much ignore them and just play F2P. And honestly, it is a genuinely good game with cool characters and (mostly) great writing. Full disclosure, I did eventually put some money into the ""Express pass"" about 60 quid total after a full year of playing pretty much every day, and Ive paid that much for far worse games that did not entertain me for as long, so Id say they've more than earned it.",Positive
"""a gacha game that doesn't feel like one"". i think that sentence describes this game the best. take genshin formula, add some honkai impact 3rd elements and lore, don't forget to make it turn-based and outcome honkai star rail. amazing music, graphic, motion. interesting story and plot progression, it really is immersive.",Positive
"Hi just have some bug issue on ""future market II"" when it suppose to talk to gepard but can't talk to him. Tried to discontinue the mission and then try on same mission but it goes on same way again. Could you please check on the bug? Bcs cant continue the story without finish it first. Thx! UPDATE : Got fixed thx guys.",Positive
"Everything is very good, from character, story and more are good. I very like this game. But I have found a little problem, first in Scalegorge Waterscape is when Dang Heng is open sea be two when in main story and it's okay, but when I want explore on the side ocean water color was black and I not sure that color must be",Positive
super fun game but can feel like effort to play when your still getting used to it. the voice acting and design graphics are great and the story line is very cool when you understand it. just make sure you have enough damn storage though lmao,Positive
"This game is taking up a whooping 30 gigs in my phone now, in comparison genshin which I've been playing for 3 years now with all it's new regions takes up only about 20 gb (after it was optimized a while back). Look I love this game, the story and combat are all so good but my god I just can't keep playing when it takes up that much storage. Can't you guys optimize it like you did with genshin? In genshin we have the option to delete past resources can't that be implemented here too?",Negative
"Unplayable at the moment on mobile because of performance issues, but on pc, it really is a great game. The story, characters, music, visuals, and sound effects are all some of the best hoyoverse has made.",Positive
"I'm in love with this game! In my opinion, there hasn't been a better story than Penacony in any other game. The characters, cutscenes and the environment are very unique for every update. I would to love see where the Astral Express takes us next!!",Positive
I updated the game and for the first time ever everything crashed. I've updated it many times previously but I think this is the update that is too much. It crashed my UI and processer. I want to play this game but looks like I can't anymore :(,Positive
Okay. Coming back to this review after playing around a little bit more and I have to say it's actually pretty fun. The humor can be kind of hit and miss the story is a little bit dull at times but overall it's a neat little game. However some of the boss fights and enemies seriously need to be nerfed. Cough cough Gambler is all I'm going to say. On top of that the pulll rate for characters should be way higher because half the time you're just pulling those memory things.,Negative
"Great story and plots, charming and captivating characters, the amazing music soundtracks really deepen and make the story feel alive. I fall in love with HSR and eager to play more. Hope there will be more companion missions so we can hang around with the characters and learn their backgrounds.",Positive
"Gets kinda boring at times, and that happens with genshin too, but this one is more frequent. I can't even go two hours playing this. But I'm not saying it's a bad game. I like the gacha system, just like genshin impact, and I like the characters. I just want bailu the most... Also, y'all's need to add more chibis, I need to keep going on my roll of the chibi collector of hoyoverse. Also, for both games, PLEASE ADD A BOY CHIBI, FOR CRYING. OUT. LOUDD... I still like this game, but it gets boring",Positive
"Thanks for this new update. I can now perpetually demolish my foes freely with a sure heck lot of things to do, like going into a fight club. I love this game so much. I can even get stickers via WhatsApp. This game is so bright, I cannot believe I am in outer space traveling from galaxy to galaxy with my team, very joyfully with March 7th. Keep up the glorious work!üëç",Positive
"HSR is a great game tbh. I really liked the design, story, and the events is pretty engaging too. So I just skipped the preinstall yesterday and today I've completed downloading the preinstall yet somehow it wanted me to reinstall the whole 14GB üíÄüíÄ. Ain't no way I'm doing allat bro üò≠üôè. It took my storage also and happened before in 1.1.",Negative
"The best mobile game. Doesn't bother you to pay. And you're paying a small amount like a subscription monthly to get better characters. I have been playing for almost a year and am going to continue playing. There's a lot of new content added monthly. Update review: sadly, to say this game becomes p2w - 3*. Don't understand why to give almost 0 probability for good characters when there's no competition between people. You are going to lose players.",Negative
"In terms of rewards exploration graphics characters , story this game is so good i used to play genshin for over 3 years but , now i find honkai to be better than genshin in some features such as the fair rewards and grinding , ide like honkai to add a coop options for fun some other features like jumping or climbing would be good too the coop thing might be hard tho giving how the game works but the players will appreaciate it",Positive
"As of now I've spent not time downloading than playing. After the play store 200mb, there's 3gb before you can play, and after maybe 15-30m there's 18 GIGABYTES? The download starts without checking if there's space, and doesn't delete itself when it aborts due to lack of said space. It starts over, ignoring whatever it has downloaded before and treating it as unavailable space. Is it worth it? I'm not sure. I've not played any other hoyo game before.",Negative
"Very good game. Good graphic, music, colourful cast of characters, well-made level design, Innovative gameplay, fun minigame and puzzle, can be enjoyed for a longplay while still accommodating ease of stamina/fuel management for daily farming.",Positive
"Solid good game, i quite say. This game has many good soundtrack and themes. I even added it in my spotify playlist ‚ù§Ô∏è. The scenery and atmosphere gives off some vibe, The characters are great,The battle layout is good, It even have an automatic battle. Which is helpful. And I love the way I got Boothill in my first one pull. Biggest luck in my whole history (‚Å†‚âß‚Å†‚ñΩ‚Å†‚â¶‚Å†) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê solid",Positive
"Divergent universe saved me a lot of time thanks(i don't even have lot of time to play 2 games). Those qol are what change the game from tedious and repetitive to fun , thanks üëç I hope you work on more skip features for busy people like me. Also can you sync maps so a can see my already opened chests.",Positive
Very fun game and dynamic runs smooth as well as voice acting and characters are very cool. Hope to see more options for your character as the story progresses and we get more updates!!,Positive
"Seems i like this pretty much because it's so awesome to play such game like this even it's my one of most relevant gacha games because of its genre , I'm not playing this game just because of its High-end graphics or something else I'm playing because of its characters,the whole Storyline i think someday I will bring us a new revolution or and ideas but Playable, enjoy able game but..... Sometimes feels something is missing",Positive
"The dialogues in game most time are funny but the game isn't shy with giving us more deeper topics, The rewards are pretty good too they did give us a free five star though it isn't available anymore they might do it again in the future, the five star they gave isn't sloppy at all and does great damage and even then the free four stars they give are pretty decent too you can really do alright I'm the game without pulling for characters so much.",Positive
"amazing game! however after finishing the content, there isn't much to do but mindlessly login and do the daily missions, or do the spiral abyss equivalent. the stimulated universe is fun, but gets old very quickly.",Positive
"I've been playing since it released a year ago and it's amazing and fun. The story, gameplay, designs, events etc. are amazing. Saving up jades is pretty easy and fun. There are even hilarious dialogues. This is one of my favorite games.",Positive
"The game needs to be optimized for lower end devices. The cutscenes are always stuttering, regardless of display settings. Most of the time, I have to tap the screen twice to proceed to the next dialogue.",Negative
"Out of all the Hoyo games this one is by far my favorite so far. The charcters and story are beautiful, and I can't just get enough of it. This is also their one and only game where it feels like they actually take feedback and listen to you, as well as giving to their F2P player base. It's easy to get characters you want, as I was able to get Aventurine and Boothill easily as a F2P player. By far the best game they've made, and they actually listen to their player base and take in feedback.",Positive
"This, game is the best I love playing it but there are a couple of things that bother me about this game like for instance there are a couple of bugs in the game and when ever I decide to Long out for awhile it resets me to the beginning I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or not but overall this game is the bestüëçüòä",Positive
"I am really having fun with HSR, the story is super good, the gameplay is nice. I love turn base game in general so I am happy to see it getting so polished. Although maybe some people will find it boring, this game is perfect for me that only have little time to play on weekdays and explore more during weekends.",Positive
"Honkai Star Rail has far less content than Genshin Impact, understandably because Star rail has only been out for little over a year. The problem is that Star rail is nearly 10GB larger. While I absolutely love that there are permanent events, there should be the option to delete past content that has already been completed.",Negative
"Facing recurring issues like 'Cannot redirect' when I try to press anything on the interface. I already tried reinstalling and it still happened. I'm not sure if it's just my phone's problem, but I would appreciate it if the dev look into this because I can't proceed with the game in peace without the problem recurring.",Positive
"It's fair, but almost impossible to link accounts on other devices without customer service. Other than that, it's a great game, but I'm almost rage quitting trying and failing to get my account on the ps and other mobile devices.",Positive
Missing QOL adjustments to be a great turn based game. Needs a skip button for dialogue. Most side quests are unbearably long winded. Summoning materials are abysmal to acquire being F2P and even if you did spend its outrageously expensive. Taking months to saveats for a limited character to just lose the 50/50 at pity is demoralizing to say the least. Game definitely doesn't reward your time. Story is ok some characters are more annoying than it should be for how much dialogue there is.,Negative
"Recently, I stumbled upon what I can only describe as a mobile gaming gem. It marked my debut into the world of turn-based games, and what an entrance it was! Impeccably designed characters, an OST that borders on masterpiece status, and a storyline that kept me hooked from start to finish. Critique? None to be found. It's simply that good, that fun. Here's to eagerly awaiting future updates!",Positive
"Really good! Never thought a Mobile game could stand shoulder to shoulder to a Console/PC game. I do have a few grievances (like the game eating a 1/3, soon to be half of my phone space, the game freezing/lagging at lowest settings) but let this be known, if Hoyoverse (the devs) ever decided to make a traditional, paid, not gacha game, it would be GOTY material. EDIT: I WAS RIGHT, IT ATE HALF OF MY STORAGE AND STILL WANTS MORE ;_;",Positive
"Actually one of the better games this company has made. honestly its way too much talking, And it has nothing to do with the actual story plot. you guys need to add a skip dialouge option as alot of the story dialouge is comparable with a Naruto filler ark. The same tired fetch and run quests do not offer any real character development.The main character is awful, no signifigance. You all are ruining a good game with poor side quests that are too long to be pointless. Good game 3 stars at Best",Negative
"Im guessing you can make multiple save file to save time down the line. But guys, im bearly got times to finish 1 run of old version. Also 3 star is unjustified because overall the game is really good.",Positive
"love this game but it's absolutely huge for no reason, fully unplayble on older devices, ridiculous to assume people can just get new storage whenever the game requires, they optimised storage space for genshin but can't here on a significantly newer game? a game designed with moblie players in mind from launch shouldnt be taking up over 10gb of storage in one update, extremely dissapointed and I sincerely hope they fix the file size issue because I would love to continue playing",Negative
"It's super fun. Graphics are beautiful, and characters are so well designed. Sometimes, when the grind in genshin is slow, i like to hop on hsr. Honestly, sometimes it gets difficult, and at level 56, im not sure, but it's so hard to get nice relics?? And since i can't build characters well, i suck at virtually everything üòî. Still, I would recommend this since it's amazing. It's really fun.",Positive
"A fun experience over all! The story line is amazing, the visuals and music are splendid and the characters are dynamic. It all comes together beautifully! My only qualms are that with every update the game is becoming a problem for my phone's storage, and unfortunately most cutscenes lag and buffer a lot which hinders the audio-visual and emotional aspect of said scene. [This has been a problem since launch on android devices] Hopefully this problem gets resolved in the next patch or so.",Positive
"Best: Nice and balance battle mechanic. The upgrade system is great and feel rewarding, require some effort to grind and the game provides facilities to navigate to the upgrade materials easily. Enemies toughness curve is consistent, as long as we power up the characters. Work well with phone (although low poly but look nice). Ok: Story, but the concept of travel universe-to-universe by space train and factions are interesting. Cons: Some dialogues are too long (Herta's memories, etc.).",Positive
"Good game, great storyline, detailed character designs, eargasm soundtracks, unique game mechanics, almost everything perfect. This game is simply the best gacha game ever. Not only does it offers a captivating storyline, but also stunning graphics, and engaging gameplay. Despite the beautiful storyline, soundtrack and everything there's one thing that bug me the most which is whenever I was in cutscenes like the fight with cocolia the audio just suddenly not clear and very like a static sound.",Positive
I have a story... Since the moment of their creation I have held distaste and sworn I would NEVER play a gacha game. And have maintained that path all these years. I got mistplay last week to make some money from gaming. Yesterday I only because I was making money off playing I said I would TRY H: S R. Minutes in and I'm feeling curiousity and intrigue to the mysterious events that are the intro. And just like that I'm enjoying the sights and sounds and characters. This is a good game.,Positive
"Great story, fun and entertaining characters, and really cool fight system. There's also a ton of optional in-game booklets and little lore bits which is also great. Only issue is that the events are sometimes locked behind completion progress, which is a really big hassle. I just updated and finished the last main quest, but I missed the last task of the Vignettes in a Cup event because it needed me to progress to play though. Very limiting for new players.",Positive
I love this game. I love the characters. I love the story. But 40 gigs? Seriously? How and why? I have games on my Playstation 5 with less than that. This is ridiculous. I am actually unable to play the game further. There is no space on any of my devices. I've spent over 100 dollar and now its useless. Seriously 40 gigs!??!? You guys are crazy to think someone can give over half of there storage on their phone or tablet to play this. I want my money back,Negative
"I really like this game to the point that this is the first time that I have put so much effort into leveling up my characters just to progress into the story and gaining valuable items just to push through. Its graphics and storyline are well designed except for a few glitches here and there, but maybe that's just my phone storage already nearing its limit. Anyway, it's a very awesome game.",Positive
"Game is great. When i first installed, i played it day and night. But after you finish the main story, side stories, character stories, mini games, theres nothing to do except grinding mats. Simulated universes are fun for a while, but after a couple weeks, it gets boring. You have to wait for updates for 2 months. And the game takes up over 20Gb on your phone. That is the biggest drawback. Other than that great story, characters, and Persona-like combat",Positive
Fun game that can be played casually. Devs give quite a few pulls so you can get some of the limited characters you desire. New gameplay modes added frequently. Character designs are great and the story is engaging.,Positive
"For a mobile game, it's pretty good! Turn based combat, amazing visuals and story, all the right ingredients that make a good experience great. The writing is good and the characters have soul. The voice acting is top notch too. The lore may be a bit complicated but it still is fun discovering something new about the world, the aeons and the characters.",Positive
"Exceptional game! Graphics, world, characters, lore, OST, everything is well planed and constructed, the devs really put effort in this game. However, I have to mention the fact that to upgrade characters is very difficult and without 5 stars characters it will be very hard to do the majority of the content's game. I hope this problems get solved over the time, it will make the game perfect!",Positive
"The developers of this game have clear bias towards female characters & their male players. I liked the game at the start because the story & combat seemed interesting, but the more the game progresses, the more it becomes another waifu game for men filled with strong female characters. It is disappointing to see how they just neglect most of their male characters & give them mediocre kits & little to no promo. This kind of unbalance leaves a bad impression to me as a female player.",Negative
"This game has strategic game and original songs. It also has lovable characters and plot storyline on the way. It's sure fun to play because there will have new events and characters! One thing that I want this game to add but I am sure it will not add, it is... Jump button, I really love jump button tbh, but the concept of the game doesn't have but it's okay. Keep it up the good work dev!!",Positive
"Amazing game, the story is interesting and fun while the characters design are brilliant. The game play can be smooth and satisfying, the divergent universe is probably my favourite new feature, I also very much enjoyed the galactic baseballer event",Positive
"Very fun game with fantastic story and characters and very generous for a gacha game for free to play players so you never feel the need to have to spend too much money. Constant rewards, very easy to earn tickets for characters, fun events with good rewards, generous pitty/pull rate for characters. Etc.",Positive
"This is my favorite game, the story are really good, the chara amazing, the gameplay is so much fun and I never get bored over this since it's release. Althought I can't play anymore since after the updates there are some issues like the bg texture totally gone, I can see the sky and even behind the wall, at first I still try to play it but it become nuisance since I need to guess where the wall is. It's really a shame, but im willing to play it again until i afford a better device",Positive
Great for players that love turn based. Otherwise it will just be hard for them. Even some of the story battles require to read the boss mechanic which most casual players will ignore. So yeah 9 out of 10,Positive
"Not gonna lie. This game is truly something that you can not experience somewhere else.. The cutscenes and characters are all well made! The lore is extremely fun to read, and overall, the game just looks amazing! This game can be a bit boring midgame, but when you reach the endgame, it gets extremely better when you can challenge your characters and builds.. I really recommend it if you have a good mental though. I went through 37 mental breakdowns when losing the 50/50. Anyways nice job devs!",Positive
"It's a very nice turn based game it has many features that I can't even tell it it has a lot of potential to be a great game even though it has already flew to the top 1 turn based game. It is a little boring cause I can't really interact with other players, and I suggest that it has one feature that can be able to fight/raid another players set up.",Positive
"Amazing, best turn based rpg experience ive ever had its just so fun playing that I don't even know how I forgot its turn based when ive always avoided turn based combat. Oh, and dont forget about the amazing story.",Positive
"Some reason I had issues with my account being lost during update. I uninstalled completely, turned off my phone completely, and finally had to reinstall after phone being turned off and being turned back on. The account is back for some reason now. Might of been a bug or something but my account is back.",Positive
"Everytime I try to start up the app on my phone it crashes immediately, apparently theres something wrong with the unity system? I've removed cache, uninstalled and reinstalled and restarted my phone but this problem still persists. I've played since launch and saved for a lot of characters, not to mention this is my only device that can support genshin and hsr. Please fix this.",Negative
"The story can be insanely yappy like Genshin without a skip button. At least not that I'm aware of at the time of writing this review. Luckily, the story is good by gacha standards. The designs are top notch as expected from a Hoyo game. All the QoL that was missing in Genshin Impact is given here. Worth your time if you wanted more end game from Genshin Impact, you like like turn based RPGs, you like anime aesthetics, you want to collect waifus & husbandos, or all the above.",Positive
"The game's graphics is pretty good, rewards are very good from events (alot), they even give rewards and free 5-star hero directly from the game's email, really good story and lores from characters, every map and worlds are pretty good too. This is a must play, unlike genshin, atleast this one is not as laggy as genshin. My problems: some events are hard to clear like pure fiction because I need characters that deals lot of damage and also relics are hard to level up because it's scarce..",Positive
"Has become my favorite game ever since the game dropped. Yes there are some bugs once in a blue moon, but the gameplay, graphics, and everything else is just great. Wasn't really a turn-based game fan at first, but since I can't play the ""open world sibling"", thought I'll just stick with this at first. But the more I play, the more I get addicted, especially cuz of hearing the JP VAs and not to mention, the high rewards. Keep up the good work!",Positive
This is probably the best Hoyo game ever. The storyline is great. The artwork is beautiful. The combat mechanism is turn based so it's also good. The maps are awesome and the most important part is that mostly everything in thia game is interact able even trashcans. Which is great. The devs absolute killed it when it comes to detailing. Incredibly detailed. There is also autobattle which is a great help for grinding materials. And yes it is hard to grind for a character. So yea its a great game.,Positive
"One of the best RPGs I have played in since final fantasy 6. The world building is so good, they can merge scifi, steampunk, and dragons and it still makes sense. Also contains one of the best written silent protagonist. Always looking forward for the next story updates!",Positive
"I didn't find it fun at first since I wasn't that used at turn-based games, but it became fun the longer I played. Anyways, keep the heat up! I hope the game's story leads to an even more outstanding adventure. (also, I can't wait for Marshal Hua, please release her already...)",Positive
Love it and I started last year This game is just perfect The only problem I have right now is that I can't go in at all The game kick me out It started since the update so I think it's the problem (I erased a lot of games so normally I still have place on my phone) I will make it 5 star if it get solved since it's the only problem for me Edit: it's solved now,Positive
"Gameplay is great, however my screen sometimes cancels out text and replaces it with red boxes and shapes, so I really hope that can be fixed, otherwise all is good",Negative
"If you love, turn base game. This is for you. It has a good story, good music, and not much to be complaint about except for the storage that is almost 24Gb (7/7/24).",Positive
"a lot of thought was put into the character's stories, but the same can not be said for their designs. not only are they so repetitive (re: xianzhou women), but the lack of diversity in skin tones is really strange considering this is a game where you visit many planets, one of which is inspired by the jazz age",Negative
Genuinely a great gacha game. The voice acting is great and you can see the care they put into the game. Definitely recommended if you're looking for a turn-based game with amazing characters.,Positive
The prices could be a bit less expensive for the bigger oneric pouches but over all I have no complaints about the game. Its fun and interesting and I really like the characters and the stories. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®,Positive
"Good characters, storylines, and art but the combat is P2W, there is no true F2P if you want to get your characters strongers you'll be grinding for and hour and need to pay to get the materials to grind or buy them. This game is also not friendly to new players, there is bug type enemy that allows it spawn an endless number of itself. And there is no F2P method to kill it.",Negative
"In a game where you travel around different planets in the universe, one would expect more diversity in their character designs. Hoyoverse games are extremely lackluster when it comes to portraying anything but white skin tones. As long as this issue is not addressed, the game won't feel as immersive as it is supposed to. HSR also lends from cultures and eras like the Golden Jazz Age without publishing any black or even brown character. This colorism is an issue across several Hoyo games.",Negative
"Patch 2.3 really sucks the fun out of me. Thank you for the horrible story and experience. Thank you for your effort making the entire end game content, new relic set, and planar, even story catered to one character only. Thank you for making it feels bad when not using the newest destruction character, good balance right?? Whatever happen to the Hunt path and erudition when you can just use Destruction? Right, they're useless, even the recent Hunt Break character is redundant and useless.",Negative
"Very fun game with different combat mechanics from other games. It's a turn based game but some what different from other turn based games like pokemon games. I played many turn based games so it's fun for me but it's really a different approach for combat for a turn based game, and it's healthy for the game. You have to really strategise to manage the skill points and gearing up our characters to for clearing content. The Character's designs, animations, aesthetics and story are just amazing.",Positive
"Great turn-based system, cool characters, good gacha system, incredible story and absolutely amazing character writing. The controls and mechanics are pretty easy to understand, the rewards and events are generous and fun, respectively, and the character design, character writing, and story are amazing, especially patch 2.1's writing for the character Aventurine. Definitely worth playing!",Positive
"""Amazing game! I'm absolutely hooked! The graphics are stunning, and the gameplay is so smooth and responsive. The levels are challenging but not frustratingly so - just the right amount of difficulty to keep me coming back for more. The storyline is engaging and the characters are well-developed. I love the variety of power-ups and upgrades available. Overall, an excellent game that's definitely worth downloading! Keep up the great",Positive
"Probably the most well-made game I've played. It has interesting characters, a well written storyline, amazing graphics and animated cutscenes. Spending money on gacha isn't necessary since the game is quite generous. The issue of repetitive farming is negated due to the auto battle function. There is also a variety of late game content. I literally can't think of a single criticism! This is an awesome game!!",Positive
"I love the game, but I've stopped playing it because the lightning is too bright during combat on some characters, ex. Jing Yuan. The lightning is so bright to the point that I feel like I'm gonna get problems with my eyes if I keep playing the game. I've tried to turn on the eye comfort mode for combat, but it still doesn't help. I've also tried to lower the brightness on my device, but it doesn't help either. The lightning just kept hurting my eyes.",Positive
"Honestly, it's a great game. I love almost all aspects of it: the soundtrack, the easter eggs, the character design, etc. However, when it comes to storage usage, it's too big for a semi-open world with turn-based combat compared to Genshin Impact, which has a huge open world. I hope we get a feature to delete past quests",Positive
"Probably one of the best games out there for mobile. The Stories are amazing, character development and telling is perfect. The gameplay is smooth and easy to understand yet, it has a lot of depth besides just numbers. The Game is very much f2p friendly and provides many opportunities to collect and save pulls for units you'd like. The Gearing is simple yet rewarding with additional ways you can get the Relics you want. Thank you HSR team... this game is one of my favourites. <3",Positive
"Love. It. Has many perks that make ut better than genshin, like early access to character level up and ascension materials. The rewards overall are much more generous than genshin, which makes me play it more. No complaints. Gave it on a Vivo Asus MacBook, and it runs perfectly fine. I just had to set the graphics to 'Low'. Diesn't ruin the appearance of the game, though.",Positive
"one of the best games i've played. well-designed characters, really good writing most of the time, decent combat system too. unlike that other mihoyo game, there is actually some things that are fun to do even after you max out on levels. overall, it's great, and i would recommend playing hsr unless you are a massive hater of the turn-based combat, or if you are afraid of wasting all your life savings on characters (which you really don't even need to do).",Positive
"IT IS A GREAT GAME. Graphics are GREAT!, it's quite optimized however, there is still parts which we're not optimized. The game size. It is very not optimized and would love it if we could delete parts which we have already completed. So it would make the game smaller, but with every update, it's its 10+ gb. It's scary how most hsr players are gonna keep up with this.",Positive
"These patches keep getting bigger and bigger, my phone has no more storage and I only play hsr and wuwa! unacceptable. fix your game or add a functionality to delete old data, how will we finish all planets and story when we're not even halfway and I don't have enough storage? it's a 120 GB phone and no I won't buy an expensive one just to play a game",Negative
"First of all, great game!!! Pls continue to give free premium currencies for free to play player like me to enjoy. I would really enjoy this with my friends if there will be coop modes or events like world bosses where we can team up our best units to take it down. I also want to recommend that let us make some group like a guild or team . I would like to have a function where I can Input commands to the auto battle like in grand summoners so that the auto mode will be more efficient.",Positive
"The best experience to play this game. I love any characters and the story is awesome however the game is heavy in my device, you would support us to reduce heaviness to be good optimized, please. I will appreciate your help.",Positive
Can't quite 5 star this as this a resource heavy game for a mobile game but if you have a phone with a good amount of storage or play this on a PC it is a very good game. After all the updates I will say there is a lot of new content in this update. The story for this update isn't quite as good as it was with the 2.2 update but despite that it's still a very good game.,Positive
"So far, hsr hasn't failed a single 5 star limited man and I LOVE that. And I like the graphics so much more that Genshin. I play it on mobile and it's just amazing. (Make Sunday playable and very, very good and strong, please). But overall, it's an awesome game with awesome graphics, voice acting, quests, characters etc.",Positive
"Connectivity issues, especially on America server is just unbearable. Great graphics and Storyline, unique combat system, interesting characters.",Positive
"i love the character designs & the storyline, it feels so much less taxing to farm for characters than on genshin impact. Definitely easier to play with the turn based system!",Positive
"The game has a bad habit of not reminding us of an update a day before in advance, causing a waste of trailblaze power from overloading them into reserve trailblaze powerüòëüòëüòë It's fun but find a solution to fix the bad update habit, I understand there's a compasation but hmmm...",Positive
"The gameplay, story, music, character design, and QOL are really good. The auto battle is a tremendous help especially when you are working.",Positive
Where to start honestly? The character designs and back stories are incredible! The VAs did so good. Hoyo is way more generous with star rail than genshin and it feels so much more like a passion project than a cash cow (even though it's making the dough..). Also a personal thing- I'm way more lucky so.... And PENACONY IS PEAK. EDIT 1 : this game takes up too much storage. please add the files thing or a lower storage qol update hoyo!!!,Positive
"I really enjoy this game! I love it! The story is cool and great, but I just got Robin, her ult song is great but I'm starting to get bored heading it, so please make her other song play random when using ult instead of just 1 song, other than that, this game is great",Positive
"This game is amazing! I really like the bosses , characters and the combats! I even like the events of this game I've been playing for 3 months and still have it today! But its kinda laggy for me a bit and it sometimes bans me from the game heh.. but I still like this!",Positive
It's a top tier game for me but I hope they will put skip button because some of the side quest are pretty boring and made my progression slower cause I always falls asleep when doing the quest or even the main quest,Positive
Imma give it 2 Stars for now because I had to wait like 5 hours just to play the game and since it AR locked me I quitted(0)_(0) Edit:now I gave it 5 stars because I lost my old account so I started a new and I got all the 5 star characters I wanted thx but please do decrease the amount of storage like genshin where you can delete old voice lines and free some storage in this game you can't replay old voice lines idk why the game was THAT MUCH OF A STORGE IY NEEDZ PLS DECREASE IT!!,Positive
"They should rename the game ""just running around"". Or longer ""just running around,solving lame puzzles,engaging in even lamer unskippable dialogues"". Farewell penacony reads like a 10th century novel and a dystopic social experiment not to puke outta boredom. Let us skip the torturous dialogues, I promise it will be the qol upgrade of the century and improve store rating. Code a game not a storybook which in any case reads 100x faster than this game",Negative
It's a good game im not even gonna lie but the space this game take from my storage is horrendous. It's crazy that this game is already taking like 20+ gb of storage despite there's still so much to explore in the near future.I'm afraid even my phone can't last that long if this goes on. :(,Positive
"I think there's some glitch happening in the astral express and the inside the ship, because when I move I don't see anything, it's all clear and only labels can be seen, the same also happens inside the stimulated universe. I tried restarting the game it's still the same. But the other worlds are fine. Pls fix this",Negative
"I've had to delete an enormous amount and I've tried to download the latest update at least a dozen times and it always says there's no room. Like, how? I've deleted SO much. I've always been able to download all the updates, but this one is taking a HUGE amount. It's way too big for mobile and keeps growing. I've never had this much trouble updating genshin impact or other games. Ffs I've spent so much money & can't even play anymore.",Negative
"The most recent update has bricked the game on my phone, I can no longer log into the game due to a ""Global Distribution Error"" that stops me from even logging in. I can't find any solutions online for this error, most of the discussion around it is a year old filled with people who weren't able to fix the problem themselves. It would be nice to see an article or something addressing this error and providing guidance on how to fix it (or at least an explanation for what is causing it)",Negative
"Another wonderful game by mihoyo. You earn characters with the good old wish system, level them up and use them to take turns in battles versus various different bosses and enemies of different difficulties. You can play completely without paying,and I have gotten as far as other people without paying. There's lots to do,such as events and levelling up your characters (there's constant farming for that) however it does all need network connection. I have heavily enjoyed playing this ü©∑",Positive
"Great, but it keeps taking up more data. I would also suggest adding a power-saving mode, a save for in the middle of a battle, and a target function for auto battle so when it is on auto it can target a specific enemy. In addition, I can't wait for a Mac version to be out!",Positive
"Ive been playing this game for about 9 days and I really am having a good time, sometimes I'm absorbed for hours to when my phone dies. This is probably the smoothest running game I've played to date, the graphics are really pleasing to the eye and the voice acting is well done. I've become invested, there's tons of things to do but you sometimes have to think outside the box when gathering missions and levels, not everything is in your face, I'm definitely enjoying this one, well done devs!",Positive
"Genuinely the best game I've played so far. I first fell in love with the space aesthetic. The gameplay, although people would argue that turn-based is bad, the uniqueness of it grasped my attention. In terms of writing, world building, etc. The recent planet, penacony was the best of all. The character development, personalities, complexities, storyline, were all perfect. I don't want to leave the sweet dream, but I look foward to the Astral Express' next destination! Overall a perfect game. !",Positive
"Graphics: insane, flashy, but sometimes blurry or pixelated. Atmosphere: enchanting, immersive, but confined to certain areas. Music: engaging / goofy, not eerie. Main character: underdeveloped, barely voiced, too dull. Character designs: attractive, but recurring, over-accesorised or vice versa. Dialogues: useful, emotive, seldom phylosophical, but overabundant, overdetailed. Battle mechanics: easy, 3-4 characters, auto-battle for multitasking, but over-repetitive, invariable. Storage: ~21 GB.",Positive
"The game is super good! Graphics, Quality, Storyline, it has everything that a lot of gamers would like! The devs are generous when it comes to giving rewards, so players are always in for a good time ^>^. Two problems tho! I find it hard geinding for Fuels, so it'd be really good of they added a way to actually farm them ><. I also find it hard grinding for Stellar Jades even if the devs often gives em on events, so i get kinda dissapointed when i miss the new characters.",Positive
"Now don't get me wrong this game is amazing and the characters are all extremely cool but there is one MAJOR flaw, The lack of diverse skin tones when it comes to characters. I genuinely was hoping that with penacony we'd at least get some new poc characters because the planet is based on jazz but alas that's not the case. I was also surprised that adventureine was white washed. If you're gonna base new planets off of black culture at least have good representation. Hoyoverse do better.",Negative
"Beautiful made stories. Every update brings in a new twist and keeps you on the edge of your seat not knowing what could happen next. The graphics is insanely well made. The background, characters even NPCs have the prettiest design. The music is the selling point of the game. Every region has a different theme and genre. I almost believed that this was made for a music game video at first. Overall, 5 out of 5. Very high production and devs that know their player base well.",Positive
"started playing after 3 months of its release. unlike other games it's still pretty generous with rewards and jades. really easy to farm (but good relic stats all depends on how good your luck is, istg i can cry- TwT) and the puzzles are entertaining, collecting characters is easier than genshin. and animations are just perfect. only takes 22gb in my phone. so it's manageable. no lag and no bugs (probably those def stats r bugs-) Yet worth downloading so go ahead ü´∂",Positive
It's one of the best turn based game out there. Story is intriguing but a little confusing. Characters have pretty good stories and personality. Combat is simple but engaging. The art is undoubtedly top notch although fanservice is a little too much. The rewards in game are enough for you to pull until pity per patch meaning not generous but not stingy. Very F2P friendly. Low tier units are enough to clear the game. Endgame is not bad but can be improve. Game is worth trying but beware its gacha,Positive
"Its good. Im having a fun time until a cut scene is played. Idk why, my phone storage isn't even halfway full and its pretty brand new, but every time there's a cut scene it just starts lagging. Pls fix it or at least have an option for mobile players to lower the framerates or qualities for cutscenes.",Positive
"VERY grind heavy game. It gets 2 stars because of the good story, fun characters, and cool worlds, but 99% of your play time is just fighting the same enemies over and over again for materials/currency. The power creep is also significant, which means it's a never-ending race to grind enough to level up the newest characters to be able to clear anything. If you play for story, characters, lore, or exploration, that gets annoying real fast. But if you play to fight, you'll enjoy it.",Negative
"The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay isn't overly difficult, I absolutely love the voice overs. The only thing that I would ever want from the game is a personal room available to customize for players, like the housing system of genshin impact, but smaller.",Positive
"I absolutely love this game, been playing for a long time now and my experience has been awesome so far. This is a little nitpicky but my phone is kinda weak for this types of games so the cutscenes being with high graphics really makes some parts of the story awful to experience. However the game is relatively optimized in everything else despite my phone heating up a bit.",Positive
"Ever since the update the game keep crashing when the battle starts and it's really annoying at some point, but overall the gameplay is nice and the story I just want to experience more without any trouble I might change my review into 5* if you fix this. Edit: Thank You Devs for listening about the problem so as Promised I'll rate it 5*",Positive
"One of the best game I ever played. The story, gameplay, many side quest. I playe this games since the first time it release. Keep up the good work. And can't wait for the next surprise the dev team bring",Positive
"It's a really good game and all, but the graphics are not the best and it's very laggy. It keeps on crashing. I also never got my 80 free pulls.",Negative
"This is a very beautiful and detailed game, the graphics are awesome there is alot to the story of the game, every world that you go into is pretty cool but there are some things i dont like about this game that maybe you guys can change in the future, i dont like how the main character that is supposed to be you is so plain looking and there is no way to change her hair or clothes, i prefer running around the game as one of my other characters rather then the holder of the stellaron..",Positive
"Its a great game don't get me wrong like the graphics stunning, the game play is amazing, the story is fantastic but my only issue is the storage and the battery drain like many other hoyoverse games it takes so much storage and I can't play that many other games that I would love to play like genshin impact or Honkai impact but I can't really have more than one of these games at a time because of the amount of storage they take up. But other than that it is an amazingly beautiful game.",Negative
"It's been a year, and man is this game good. It's always been amazing, but somehow they manage to outdo themselves. The music, characters, voice acting, writing, world building, lore, and combat are all polished and well done. QoL updates are frequent. Free pulls are frequent. You can do all major content with the free characters, but it's not too hard to get limited characters because the gacha system isn't super punishing. Even the side quests and events are well done. I love this game.",Positive
I started playing this since January and have not skipped a day. I am obsessed with all the characters their personalities and the world and the story. Peakony really delivered. But after finishing 2.2 I woke up to find I'm logged out and I can't log in since then. I am really worried about it. I wish to get some info or help from the devs. I love this game and can't lose it yet. And all the characters I've built I can't lose them too. It's been frustrating,Positive
"Amazing, the story is crazy and has a lot of plot twists that I love, (March 7th is hot) my only problem is that when there's a update it takes like 9 hours to load the game, and I have 900 GB left, üíÄ",Positive
"This game is very good and I like it, the story, music, definitely should try it if you can! Though the combat mechanism would seem a bit complicated at first you'll get used to it eventually. What I really like is the rewards and achievements you can get, It can be F2P friendly if you're hardworking, And the permanent events! It's so fun for endgame, I am glad they made it permanent:)",Positive
"i suggest removing the short quest missions between events. the purpose of the event is to have fun. i always have to walk around and yap with the npcs in events where i should be having fun, and honestly it‚Äòs so annoying.",Negative
"Update 4: hello, creator. Today in this month I've decided to try to download the game starrail another chance, but when i came back the background wasnot there, the floors too especially. But the experience was smooth as i remembered at 1.0 version, got Acheron. And all, but as days goes by.. yup, i couldn't load my game anymore, it lags and crashes. Let's say the Astral Express was split in half (in the introduction). And couldn't do anything. Keeping my rating a 3 though.",Negative
"The graphics & storyline are incredible and it is even easier to farm relics, materials and even boss just borrowed your friends character, and a free 10 pulls in every phase 1 new character, and it is easier to farm stellar jades üî•üî•",Positive
"I really enjoyed it when it first came out, but I've lost motivation to continue. Idk why; but I'm just not attached to the majority of the characters, the story doesn't capture my attention anymore, the gameplays lost it's appeal, the events became a chore I had to force myself to finish, and now I just don't do them at all. The only thing I look forward to is new characters to try and change up the fights, but even then, the excitement quickly dies, and I lose interest all over again.",Negative
"The relic farming system is starting to annoy me like Genshin. The layers upon layers of randomness in the relic system is unnecessary. It is created just to make an artificial gameplay loop. Sometimes it makes you think if you're wasting your time with the game. And the PING is abyssmally high, for a single player game, it's unacceptable.",Negative
"The story and gameplay are all good but my problem is my device always encounters some lags, including voice stuttering. I have tried everything i know to reduce lags, I even tried lowering my graphics but it still lags on cutscenes. My device can handle a medium setting, smooth exploration and more but cutscenes always ruins my experiences. I've read a bunch more people experiencing the same problem. Is there any way to fix it? is it possible to reduce the graphic's of the cscene for some devic",Positive
"I want to rate this game higher. I've been playing Hoyoverse's games for years and im aware of the issues the games have. But this one is by far the most annoying and only affects Honkai: Star Rail??? Random times whenever I open the game the volume never works. My in game volume is all the way up, my phone volume is all the way up and even my notifications settings are too. I tried resetting my phone or reinstalling star rail and it doesn't fix the issue. I have a Revvl 5G T-Mobile",Negative
"This game is very F2P friendly, the graphics are beautiful even in mobile, the combat is pretty good, music, lore, everything! Yet it also has alot of bugs, an example of that is, when I ultimate, the animation would bug and stop, I have to reset the game ;~;. But overall pretty good game!",Positive
"I game that is different experience. Character that felt loved and enjoyable moment. The storyline is superb. Finished the main story by beating Sunday in less than 5 days. I hope tnew story will come soon since I fell in love with this game. I really enjoyed it. The graphics are good. Voice after did a great job with it, too. The developer of this game. Please keep up with this ge and make it every second worth it. It deserves the love of this game. 100% I'd recommend this game.",Positive
"The game graphics and animations are amazing! Even though its turn based, it makes up for the play style of each character and their animations. Other than that, the storyline is great overall and the abundance in characters is really cool as you get different playstyles and gaming experiences.",Positive
"Much better than Genshin Impact because it respects the players' time more. You can auto battle any fight if you're feeling lazy, except certain storyline or boss fights. Farming leveling materials is very easy and quick. Farming gear is still the downside of things, BUT you don't have to worry too much about getting the perfect gear IF you keep your world level low. For casual players I would recommend only going to world 3 or 4, after that you do need to be picky about your gear, teams.",Positive
"This game is very good, but there is a problem if you play on mobile (which I'm doing) it will lag well for me especially on android Motorola it will kick you out in like what 30-160 seconds or a couple mins please fix this atleast make an update to fix the lag",Negative
"Love how the characters are highly accurate and that they're not taking shortcuts in designing their in-game models. Stories, whether they are side or main quests are detailed and there's not much yapping going on, and the choices you make actually have variety. There's so much to do in this game.",Positive
"I love this game. Great graphics, characters and story. The only thing I have a issue with is the amount of storage this game takes up. I have 128 GB of storage on my phone, yet I'm still worried about how much space HSR takes up. Every update the amount of storage needed increases, and I really want to keep on playing. If it gets to a point where I need to start deleting things to play, I might just delete Honkai. I'm sure there's some way to lower or delete unneeded storage.",Negative
"the game itself is great. art style, characters, music, references, lore and much more. the reason why i rated 4 star is because there's a problem with the log in loading that turns into black screen for 2-3 minutes (or more) and just background music playing. i hope this gets fixed because i find it irritating. -thanks",Negative
"Though the game is great it has a problem and that's the storage. Not only is it bigger then genshin but somehow the environment also glitches and just disappears and reappears so quickly not to mention how alot of it won't even load leaving you to see the map to feel unfinished. It is very u pleasant to look at and when a cutscene happens some parts of the environment glitches,btw it also based on where you aim your screen so if you swipe to change the direction of your screen it'll glitch diff",Negative
"I play both hsr and genshin and enjoy both. Hsr offers a fresh gaming experience with turn-based combat after playing in open-world in genshin. Characters, voice acting, and story is incredible. The scripting for stories and the dialogue options for the MC is so funny. I can tell the devs put a lot of thoughts into each detail. Highly recommend!",Positive
I LOVE this game. The game play is smooth on my phone and weakness matching my team for enemies is easy. Character summoning is much more accessible tha in genshin impact. Leveling up and ascension for characters along with getting trailblaze xp is easy(much more than genshin impact). BUT my two big problems with the game are that you cant upgrade a special banner characters eldion level once the banner goes away and said characters specific light cone is basically permanently inaccessible.,Positive
"Love the new story and event, but the movie & sequel event is so laggy(its like around 10 or lower fps), even when i changed it to lowest settings it doesn't seems to work and doesn't changed anything.. (i never experienced something like that before update and If i compared with when playing muse dash even with highest settings i never had a problem similar to that) its crucial for that kind of minigame .. pls fix",Positive
"A great game for an F2P, only one of the Hoyoverse games I'm able to play. Started 3 months ago, got stuck with bosses, had fun leveling up, farming items , exploring and coming up with team combos and strategies to defeat bosses, cool characters, great music and interesting story. Excited for more content and Hoyo never disappoints!",Positive
"This is by far my favourite game to play, the character designs are amazing, the story is absolutely fascinating and worth playing and the puzzles are very fun to do and the small little games/side quests are very, very fun to play. I absolutely love Honkai Star Rail and genshin Impact, and the new 2.2/2.3 special programs are amazing. I'm really excited for Firefly!!",Positive
This is a good game solid 80/100 I think people should give it a try the turn based combat is fun the art is amazing. The gacha is a bit unforgiving but they do give you plenty of currency to pull if you play the game.,Positive
So when I was logging in back to the game after firefly is released when I'm loading into the game and logging in for some reason it says my account doesn't exist and I asked my friend to check my account it's still there but all my characters (other than the starters like Dan hen and March) are all gone all 4 stars and 5 stars it still shows my trailblaze power but all my characters are gone and no bio please fix this.,Negative
"Love the character designs and story. It is also a good detail to have a description about everything thats happening (my favourite being the description of the aeons/gods that are in this game). The developers are also very generous. If you prefer games that require less travelling and more combat and lore, this game is for you. I also enjoy the streams that they run, its always very comedic and funny. I also love the theme songs that they have in the game, especially in Penaconys dreamscape.",Positive
"The game is good and I've been playing since Jing yuan's banner,but since then the game has gotten more heavy which I don't have any problems with. But the frame drops I have each version is now increasing with the release of penacony, i would like to see more options to make the game smooth or more settings decrease frame drops. As I've seen in genshin impact cloud.",Positive
No skip option. The start of the game is very underwhelming. I'm stuck having to go through a bunch of dialog. Currency is very lacking early game. Had a better experience with wuthering waves.,Negative
"Very good game, beautiful story, and everything worthy of a 5 star game, but for the live of God I cannot with the storage space, I'm unable to play the game because of it, I don't even have enough space on my computer anymore üò≠",Positive
"This game is great, I will probably remember it forever! The amazing soundtrack and wonderful world, all of the side quests and extra details...the voice acting and the story, not to mention the great character designs! Its visually great, its fun to play and I could get lost in thought just listening to the atmosphere...This helped me through my depression and during my time at the hospital. Im so excited for this game to continue and become even better, Thank you all for making this game!",Positive
"Good game. Been playing from the start. Everything is fine. The characters and cutsence are very nice. But one problem,when im logging out from the game to log other account,it accidentally exit the game and it makes me feel really annoying, it happens to me like 10 times. If you can,pls fix this.",Positive
"since 2.0 the game has been suddenly crashing nd closing. the content is amazing, so are the rewards , so generous. I'm loving everything, but it's getting hard to play because it's difficult to run. btw my phone runs genshin pretty easily, so I don't think the problem really is my phone yk...",Positive
"I've had this game since it released and honestly it's amazing! It's a very good mix of turn based combat and story! It's, so, so not even that hard to get materials and the game! Though I would say it's pretty hard to level up your characters if you don't have a few 5 stars. But that just could be me and my inability to build characters :(",Positive
"As much as I want to praise the game, there are a few things I bump into. Certain quest bosses are too powerful. Most of my characters are 60 and relics almost maxed, i use the correct characters for weakness break, and it just won't do. It's frustrating. I can't even defeat a lvl58 against 4 lvl60s. I have run into this a few times, and i can't get any further if i do not complete the quest as I've done all side quests up to this point. Besides that, I do like the game",Negative
Honkai star rail is a great game overall with stunning visuals and storylines. The combat is decent but I have two problems with the game. #1 the grind. It takes a lot of grinding and I mean seriously a lot. #2 The storage. This is not really a problem but jd highly recommend not getting this on phone and instead on console or pc as it takes up 30 gigabytes and the game is not even complete whole writing this. Worthwhile experience but dont get it on a phone.,Positive
"I think I just lost my process, everytime I log in it introduces me as a new player but with that same account I am at penacony but right now apparently I just met March 7th! I love this game and I am trying to figure out what happened but nothing is working",Negative
It's a really fun game with great characters and I still don't fully understand the story but I have fun just running around I don't have a PC or console so getting to play a game like this on my phone it's kinda hard to find the tools you need to level up and increase your characters and companions power so defeating major big bad bosses takes forever cause you gotta constantly retreat and revive your characters plus constantly changing the people on my team besides that the games fun to play,Positive
"The game is lovely! The gacha system is fair and I don't feel forced to spend money to get the characters I want. Voice acting is great, as are the animations My only wish is that the devs would impliment the system they have in Genshin where you can delete data from passed content you've already completed so mobile players can save space. My game has been laggin and crashing as of late, not to mention the game is slowing down too and glitching during cutscenes on Penacony",Negative
"This game is incredible, awesome, and amazing from the story, gameplay, character, and generous for free player. I hope in the next update will have a love quest like for who pick the caelus can have love story with girls character and for who pick the stelle can have love story with boys character",Positive
"Update on my review. The game has ended up working near perfect. Sometimes in my game it kicks me out when I'm about to fight something. It like lags when the ""screen cracks"" and then it pauses and kicks me out. Besides that I farley enjoy the game! Incredible characters, story and sound. This has become my favorite mobile game.",Positive
"Game is good, graphics is good. Story is good. But the way gatcha system works for wishing character is really addictive. Feels like dev trying their best so we can waste our money on this game. Worst RNG . It's demands too much time from players for better experience. If you want to go with trend of hoyo you better waste money on it unless there is no way you will get every character you like. Addictive Not recommended for students. Recommended for those who have a lot of times on their hand.",Positive
"Very f2p friendly and the developers tend to be very generous to thier players. Gameplay, story, and world is fantastic and if you like turned based games this is one of the best out there. A very fun yet unique and intuitive system that rewards smart play in higher endgame activities. Character design is also fantastic! Give it a try. It's only free and it up to you if you'd like to invest into it but it's very viable as a free to play. Warning: late endgame activity not so f2p friendly though",Positive
"HSR is a game that accomplishes the remarkable feet of setting up an interesting concept and setting but never utilizing any of it to it's full potential. Pros: OST is great The voice acting is decent And the visuals are good Fun combat Cons: Characters, if not most of them are either bland or underdeveloped. Most of the main story plots are bloated with characters either wasting your time or repeating dialogue constantly. Or is monotone in execution. Gacha game Power creep is really bad.",Negative
A fun game that turns into a bit of a grind at the end. It's got an exceptional story that keeps getting better and has me hooked in from the word go. The gatcha side of things is fun although stressful as you might miss characters but everything else is a 10/10 with lots to do and a great emphasis on solo game play,Positive
"Really fun, free, turn based RPG game! Don't need to spend money to have fun and progress, interesting stories and characters, and always plenty minigames to do even when you're up to date with story quests. Love the music too. Only MINOR gripe which is the same with every JRPG - why are all the womens dresses so short üòÖüòÖ Oh well, at least they look pretty ü©∑",Positive
"The game is actually good! But the loading is to long to wait. Sometimes the screen just blank for 10 minutes and the loading took me like 2 hours. Just dont gave up yet, I love the character and character background! Love your creativity and Please fix it right away. Also theres some glitch you need to fix.",Positive
"Hello! I really love the game, but I just want to recommend the ability to lower the equilibrium level. I did the trial of equilibrium and I immediately regret it ü•≤ the enemies were too high level and I keep dying..",Positive
"I like the story, lore and music and you don't need to know the story of Honkai Impact 3rd to feel lost since it tells a story in a different universe. Also compared to Genshin, farming for resources is a lot easier but still hard to come by (e.g. limited Trailblaze power. After using all of it I don't have much to do) plus events also give you lots of resources like the 'Gift of Odyssey Login' that gives you additional tickets to pull for a special character. Overall a nice game.",Positive
"A breath of fresh air among the rising open-world genres of gacha games! While most of the time I usually get bored of turn-based gameplay, Star rail did not have that problem! Moreover, it did a great job in character design and personality! No kidding I'm invested to each one lol. But, its highlight has got to be its story! At first it started out pretty decent throughout the Luofu Arc, but when Penacony arrived it reached PEAK LEVELS of pacing, originality, and story! Looking forward to it!",Positive
"Good game, can still play while doing something you can leave the farming in auto and get back if it is finished. Love the Story as well, tho some puzzles are quite difficult to some, it can still be solved. The hard part is getting better relic sets.",Positive
"Game is good, challenging, good puzzles, good story, good music.. Gameplay is linear tho, there is an ongoing gameplay design which locks your character into a singular gameplay, old characters are blatantly and apologetically powercrept, such a shame because charactwr design is stellar.",Positive
"Love this game, it's just always a lot to do. I don't mind taking my time getting through a game, but if you do mind going slow this game might give you issue. It takes a lot of time to build good characters. It's easier to build a good character here than in Genshin though, imo (love both).",Positive
"Previously 1-star because of error message. Has been played since last year and so far I have good experience. The plot and the character designs are interesting. Easy material farming because it has auto function. The developer is generous too always gives free 10-pull every patch. As F2P, it's enough. My problems are sometimes there is mistranslation for EN that's different from other language. Also please let us clear previous missions to reduce storage usage.",Positive
"While the game does give great rewards and the gameplay is smooth and everything, but still coming from Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin I personally always felt HSR is a downgrade since you can't jump, can't really fight like actually fighting all you can do is continue the turn based gameplay also the open world isn't completely open world either you can't fall off from the sides overall it's an okay game with 7/10 gameplay, lore and story is great though",Positive
"Great game. I would give 5 stars if it didn't crash after a while. I don't know if I'm just doing things too fast or something but it's fine at first, but after a little while it start getting increasingly laggy until the game either crashes or the player restarts the app. Then it goes back to normal.",Positive
"The turn-based combat is already expected, but the system of this game is cool. The story is engaging. The interface is good. The character designs and the locations are a perfect balance of freshness and familiarity. There may be a few bugs in terms of loading some maps, but they do not stop you from enjoying the game",Positive
"after the planar double update things keep on lagging and now im stuck fighting the boss because when it lag, it will reset the bossfight. will change the rating after you guys fix this things. update: they actually fix it and i never encountered the problems anymore, thanks.",Positive
"Fun, flashy turn based anime rpg. Very grind heavy and, as expected, suffers similar setbacks as Genshin. 5 Star gatekeeping isn't as bad but still rough. Severe lack of multiplayer content for now. Still, enjoyable endgame content with more to come, as well as an interesting story and characters.",Positive
i love this one better than Genshin Impact... it is more flexible on the wishes and you get way much more. I also love the story. it is a turned base game and I like it very much took me some time to understand. I also love the characters and their trailers are just 10/10. so those out. the music beautiful,Positive
"I have been playing this game since launch and i have been enjoying it but my biggest problem about the game is how a lot of the events, game content and etc is gatekept until you beat certain story missions, which is fine. But there is no way to skip or even speed up the dialogue to get these story missions, which without this it makes the game honestly not that fun. Most people dont have the time to sit done and listen to hours of dialogue because they might have jobs or other things to do.",Negative
"I've played the game for around three months now, and it's amazing. Both are on mobile and desktop. The characters and the story are amazing, and the gacha system for characters is (in my opinion) amazing, with the option to be f2p and still (with small amounts of grinding) be able to get the characters you want. Amazing game, literally in love with man. IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY. :3",Positive
Ive been playing since release literally day 1 and im not gonna lie this game is genuinely just perfect. It has everything going from an insane and unique combat system to the character and enemy design now dont even get me started on the fact about the ultimate every single one is a complete masterpiece and i would definitely recommend yall playing this game you have seen it really trust me just download it play it for 3 days and see how you feel. This game is like a blessing given by god.,Positive
"I like the combat. Typical anime style. There's actually an 18 gig download after the 'tutorial'. Plus, there are stupid little things like short load times between every line of dialogue. Also, the characters talk about stupid things, so have fun being forced to sit through a lot of that. This kind of game design is why mobile games are still a joke.",Negative
"genuinely one of the best games i've ever played. each character has rlly good lore, the side quests are as meaningful as the main quests and oh my god the 2.1 main quest/trailblazer quest had me in tears for a character i initially hated. i've never rlly liked turn based games but omg hsr is just genuinely so good.. the designs, the world building, the characters, the lore, the mechanics... everything is just so good and enjoyable. 10/10 !!",Positive
"I enjoy the game a lot, it's so much fun! After a whole year of playing I can say that the developers really care about my time as they keep adding more functions which would allow to live life at the same time! The story is engaging, I enjoy character designes and gameplay a lot. The best project by HoyoVerse so far! It's also nice to see that the devs really go through the feedback from players, like wow the company actually listens, so cool... Solid 5 stars for me‚ô•Ô∏è",Positive
"everything in this rating is just my personal gripes with the game. why is the story quest sunday boss ridiculously overpowered and hard to beat? sure, i like a good challenge every now and again, but it's not even fun. it's actually frustrating. if he doesn't nuke my dps, i'm still spending hours trying to break the sheild that keeps refreshing. still, maybe it's just a skill issue on my part. but i can't properly build my boothill because the echo of war trace materials are locked.",Negative
"I honestly enjoyed the game itself along with the characters' lore, arc quests, music, graphics, and boss fights in this game. Not many are fans of the game mechanics, which is worth giving a try since it is very easy to play as an FTP player. I do like the gacha system of this game since weapon banners have their own banners. It is also easy to grind for the characters/weapons of your choice. I would say the only con in this game is that you can't move down from world levels or do coop mode.",Positive
"Loving this! As a Hoyo player since GGZ, I enjoy this. Seing Honkai Impact characters again and few of Genshin's VA's. For the performance, it's good. It runs smoothly on my 4gb ram device. Character design and the animations are on top. However, for the story, it's fine and good BUT I didn't expect them to bring up deaths in here. It's ""Honkai"": Star Rail for a REASON.",Positive
"To compare star rail to genshin, while I enjoy genshin as a game more but hsr is a lot easier to play, easier to stick to, genshin takes 10x more time to farm, do daily quests, earn resources.. hsr has everything handed to you, the game is WAY more optimized, the developers try way more, they actually consider player feedback, they actually bring meaningful UI changes... i dont like the characters/story as much as I do in genshin but as far as the gaming aspect goes hsr is way better.",Positive
"The world building within the game is intricate and rich. Some of the cutscenes are so well animated that you'd think it came straight out of an anime! The characters each have their own back story, both those you can play and those that are NPCs. No necessary in app purchases! My only complaint so far is that it eats a bit more of my phone's memory than I was expecting.... It's my opinion that if the game makers ever try to make an anime, it'd be one that I'd definitely watch....",Positive
"The game is good and I enjoy it alot, but everytime Cutscene plays it keep laging and the audio goes static even though my phone still runs hsr smoothly, I see alot of players complaining about the cutscenes lags problem, and I hope you guys can fix this, because if the Cutscene lags it just ruined the hype of the Cutscene please fix this soon, overall the gameplay and story is good and fun...that's all üòÅ",Positive
"So far, this is my fave game! I never imagined will have an addiction into a battle kind of game. I love the story and the gameplay. Even the mini game is so interestingly fun. It's just not storage friendly for some handphone. Hopefully, you have a great income so this kind of thing doesn't matter for you!",Positive
"I like the game overall, I did a break on the game because of some issues and focused on genshin but after some months I considered trying to play the game again, but the main issue is that my account is gone and I lost my progress, I have to start over again because of it,,, I hope u can fix it... But as of now I will rate 3 star...",Negative
"Fun game and story. Love the graphics and combat system. I've been playing for months. I will say, that it takes a bit of time to upgrade certain characters when you get to a certain point. However, it took a long time for me to get to that point. Overall, I love this game and there's a lot to do in it.",Positive
"I love boothill. The quality is amazing and the story is just peak perfection. I also love how they treat their players, and how much plot there is to a single moment. The character designs are also amazing and their background stories are all *chefs kiss*. 10/10, would love to play for the first time again. I ALSO WON MH 50/50!!",Positive
"Stunning. AMAZING! BEAUTIFUL! Honkai Star Rail is the best open world RPG game I've ever played. The story is good by itself, but the events and characters are really great as well! You can tell so much thought and world building is taking place in each update. The quests can get a little tedious, so events are a good break. The gacha system is also my favorite! It's not hard- after 7 months I've gotten 9 5-stars as a f2p! Please download Honkai!!!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
"One of the best gacha games i have played. Story might be a bit confusing at the start, but give it time and it aged like a wine. OST in this game is nothing but perfection, it make you hype for the battle and when the boss come, oh boy you gonna have eargasm with every boss phase. Battle is standard turn based and trust me you just need a little braincell to complete all story content. you might need more effort (aka search how to fight, strategy etc) to do end game content.",Positive
"I adore this game so much. The graphics, the characters, the storyline. Everything. Expect 2 things. 1) Character ascension. It's tedious. It's annoying. It's boring. And then you have to level up your characters immediately afterward. Otherwise, you did all of that for nothing. 2) The Xianzhou Luofu storyline. It lacks entertainment compared to Belobog and Penacony. It's still good, don't get me wrong. But it is by far the most boring. I hope to God that we don't revisit it in the future.",Positive
"It's a good game however trailblaze power (energy system) which every damn gacha game has is ridiculous cuz it takes forever to build characters. wish u could just make it that enemy would drop material not with energy but with actuall fighting and grinding. it's not fun man, it's just not fun anymore. I used to love the game but now it's just not fun anymore. Now i just log on do daily quests and log out cant play the game cuz i have no energy. Sry for not spending money i guess. GG",Negative
I tried supporting this game but it's unplayable. The turned based combat system makes the game too hard and the new bosses get worse and worse over time. There is no redeeming quality for this game anymore. Add a lower enemy difficulty feature. My characters get one shot by the enemies and bosses. Friends list is pointless because you can't play with friends. I just can't care about this game anymore.,Negative
"I think this game is very exciting and I love the storyline very much! The characters are awesome, the graphics is fine but sometimes kinda lagging (maybe it's because my phone) For those who like adventure games but don't want it to take up too much phone storage this one is the best!",Positive
"I love this game and I play it on a daily basis. Story is good, gameplay is good, characters are awesome. I don't know about the pulls. It's not very appealing for f2p players especially because of the double banners where you can only get ""1"" 5* character or none even grinding all the events. Also after a year this game still has no ps4 controller support on android. IOS also only has xbox controller support. That doesn't make any sense at all with the most common controllers of all time.",Positive
"Great game! Been playing since release. The only problem I have is storage, with all the upcoming patch updates, I think a way to delete old data (e.g. completed story quest etc...) might be helpful. Overall, HSR is a fun game!",Positive
It's surprisingly fun turn based combat game with excellent character design. The story can get a bit confusing at times but the environment is rich and there's a fair share of rewards for a gotcha game.,Positive
"Pretty good game for gacha fans. The only thing I kinda dislike is the difficulty to rewards ratio as the hardest levels should give exponentially more rewards than the ""easy""ones. Beside that,the game is pretty fun and gets new content frequently. Would definitely recommend trying it if you enjoy the genre.",Positive
"I really love the game i'm a f2p but iwant to do so many comps and different teams, i don't need to play everyday which both good and bad but i'm busy so for my situation it is very comfortable, i realy like the story and the references but don't over use them, but i have a bug, in the story i reached to the Scene of Gallagher talking to Mikael and the game disactivate it self i chucked the ubdate theres no problem with it so i tried to reinstall the game so if it a real bug please fix it",Positive
"A well made game. The games graphics are appealing and well optimized, the presentation is clean, the voice acting is top notch, the turn based gameplay is fun, and the gacha elements are almost non intrusive. You can easily get far into the game as a free to play player, you won't miss out on anything doing so as the games gacha element is fair.",Positive
"Been playing since patch 1.6 and now everything is going amazingly, the story is what gives it most of the rating, even if it isn't complete. As for gameplay, though I have some complaints, they're not urgent enough to lower the rating at all. 5 stars",Positive
"Turn-based combat is widely regarded as a genre that emphasizes strategic gameplay. However, HSR's combat system appears to be limited to basic attacks, skills, and ultimate abilities. Furthermore, the strategic depth of the game seems to be heavily reliant on character abilities, which are obtained through gacha mechanics. This approach may limit the player's ability to develop and execute diverse strategies, as they may be restricted by the characters they have acquired.",Negative
"Not much to say, gameplay, QOL update every single patch, great character/ui design. But there's a big problem with the turn based which cannot be fixed. The power creep on new characters.",Positive
"Game is very phenomenal and it's my first time playing it. But somehow when I head to the official community section, it automatically closes the entire game. I've already try uninstalling and reinstalling the game but the bug keeps happening. Please help.",Negative
This has to be the best Turn Based RPG game in mobile. Story is amazing with characters that are cool and funny. The music is fantastic really capture the moments you experience in the storyline. The exploration is nice with cool hidden lore/memes. I highly recommend this one a try.,Positive
"This is the last update my phone can fit, I had to uninstall a bunch of system files in order to fit this one which is sad, it means next time I'll just have to uninstall and that's it. I'm not sure if anyone from the company actually bothers to read these but if you do, optimize this thing. This not an ultimatum or anything, it's merely a fact that I won't be able to play it anymore next update.",Negative
Honestly idk why but this game lags a lot and load wayyyy longer than that one hoyo game that is way more complicated than star rail. But i love the rpg experience where the storyline is decided by the dialogue we choose when playing. The character and the semi open world designs are also amazing. But i don't think the game type (turn based) is really for me because it feels too monotonous.,Negative
"Ok cool game, but sometimes the bosses are too hard to defeat and takes days or even weeks and what makes it worse is when your mainly built characters is not the majority of the enemy's advantage system smth idk and not EVERYBODY wants to farm that long and then when i want to log into the game there is going to be an error lots of times so pls fix this <3",Positive
"Got nothing to say but praises about this game. From the plot line, to the characters to the fighting; everything is just chef kiss. The characters are amazing especially their backstory and skill animations. The only problem you can get is being too stress of getting every character in this game because they are all awesome lol.",Positive
"I've been playing this game since day one, so happy with how much this game rewards you for playing! Really cute and charming game I'd recommend to everyone. The only minus is that every second half of the update there's always nothing to do so you just have this daily loop of log in-spend energy-log out with Simulated Universe reseting every week.",Positive
"""Role playing game"" but it locks most of the story behind difficult battles that you need to sink time and resources into well-built characters for. The newest 2.2 boss is basically impossible for newer and casual players, but they don't care because they want you to spend your money on 5-star characters to progress. There's no option to temporarily reduce the world level to make it a little easier either.",Negative
"After finishing genshin for the story I realized there was nothing left to do so I heard a bunch of my friends talking about honkai: star rail, so I decided to try it out. The story was the best I have ever seen penacony was peek and I couldn't believe that they were made by the same company free 10 pulls every patch, free 5 star (Dr ratio), actually decent anniversary, almost no dry patches (I believe we only had 2 or 3 in the entire game), and multiple versions of endgame content.",Positive
"Best gacha game imo, good rewards, perfect endgame, and very casual. Not to mention the story, that's also pretty good, it can be a little weird at times like about Tingyun but it is to be expected about gacha stories, other than that it's quality completely outshines that of other games out right now, especially on the turn based rpg side of the gacha space.",Positive
"The powercreep is bad. The skills that we need are slowly being replaced by p2w elements bc they balance new enemies to newer characters too quickly. Each characters and enemies are too niche so you are forced to pull for meta characters even if you don't like them. This happened because the game is too oversimplified, chars only have 2 skills and there are too many weaknesses we have to match, in a gacha game with low rates. Also each chars only do 1 specified role, or too many, bad balancing.",Negative
"Been playing for a year. Enjoying every moment of it. Constantly surpasses my expectations with every story arc. Fun and stylish characters, amazing music, and you can see the hard work and love put into every scene. A celebration of gaming.",Positive
This has been an amazing game so far! I love wishing but it's just my luck that ruins it. You can explore and the story is great! The characters attacks are fully well animated! I hope more games like these could be developed in the future.,Positive
"Absolutely amazing. Everything about this game is great. The story, the characters, the gameplay... the dialogue is plentiful but it doesnt feel boring. Its also very free to play friendly. Totally 5 out of 5 for me.",Positive
"It's actually a solid game. It's a bit on the easy side but there's a lot more varied and interesting endgame compared to Genshin. Simulated Universe is genuinely fun and is comparable to Hades. The devs keep adding and expanding the endgame content and Simulated Universe almost every patch. The story and lore are great, the music is excellent, and the characters are unique and interesting. The gacha mechanics are arguably very f2p friendly, so if you dont mind gacha this is a game worth playing",Positive
"Solid f2p gacha game. It's quite generous with giving out pulls and jade for gacha. The game has element of Final Fantasy vibe for exploring and turn base fighting. Game play, graphics, stories are great. There are lot of challenges to do later on. However it could get boring and redundant for farming from time to time. Also, there is no way to farm ""edilons"" unless you whales and pull hard on limited banners. At some point they should include the ""old limited banner"" into permanent banner.",Positive
Games great. Characters are fun. Unskippable cutscenes are everywhere and they keep putting bad and or really fing annoying minigames in the story that you have to do to progress. The hanu wolf stuff is garbage.,Negative
"This is one of my favorite games to play. I find the character designs and personality amazing. I love the combat style too even if I know it's not for everyone. The story is interesting and quick enough that I don't get bored of the story. It is a grind heavy game if you want to maximize the DMG output your characters can have. I have fun building my characters and maximizing their DMG...I somehow turned my Aventurine into a DPS because of this. It's a very f2p game, go for characters you like.",Positive
"It's a F2P safe and casual game, not to mention the story and gameplay gets quite unique with every different worlds you encounter. The devs are also quite generous and listen to any feedbacks. Love all the unique yet familiar characters with each update new stories and gameplay also gets implemented. A must to play game.",Positive
"Great potential, awesome characters, meaningful depth and story telling. Bogged down by heavily repeated puzzles and mini games to draw out the overall game time, with long main stories and non skippable scripts. Poorly executed.",Negative
AMAZING GAME!! AND HAPPY THAT IT CAME OUT ON MY SPECIAL DAY WITHOUT REALIZING IT UNTIL MY COUSIN TOLD ME 4 DAYS BEFORE! all the worlds are amazing to explore and fight! makes it extremely exciting! but getting to equilibriums is aa but hard! that's part of it! it helps you be tactical in combat in RPG games!,Positive
"Story is quite immersive, each character is special no matter the rarity. Graphics are stunning and clean, the game is overall quite generous to players and it's not required to spend money! Overall a very good game! Must try even if you aren't a space nerd.",Positive
"Another lovely Honkai :P Well nothing is flawless so the important part is to be ""good"" which this game & its team is. - Decent & interesting story. - Beautiful designs. - Pretty suitable gameplay. - Great acting. - Music is top notch. - A very good support and consistent contents. All of them makes me to love this game, So thank you so much for this lovable journey .",Positive
"Love it. There is a learning curve to get the best out of your team, but it's quiet intuitive and can lead to some interesting combinations. Regular updates, plenty of ways to earn resources and lots to do in game. A real joy",Positive
"Out of all Hoyo games, this one is by far my favorite. The world is rich, the ftp rewards are GENEROUS, and every character is designed well. So far, there are a fair number of both male and female playable characters. I have been playing since day 3 and I won't be leaving anytime soon. Take your time with story and you won't be bored. With a rich story, outstanding music, great visuals and VAing around the board, this is a game you SIMPLY HAVE to experience!!",Positive
"Ost, graphics, voice acting, story, lore, gameplay, character building, everything about this game is 5 star worthy. The gacha aspect might be worrisome to some, but you can easily finish the main story quests with the free characters the game provides you with, not to mention the game is F2P friendly anyways, saving up for characters is easy since the game is quite generous with rewards and events, and the quality of life this game has is superb, there is an auto battle feature for farming!",Positive
"Been playing this game since day 1 and this is one of my first few turn based games that I ever played too. This game is so fun, farming is very easy since u don't need to do anything most of the time (autoplay exists), actually only time u need to manually play is when ur doing some mission which forces u to do so or in the endgame content. Very stress free game that u can just farm while ur class or while working too. Story is definitely top 10 for me (Luofu took it down a lot). It's very F2P.",Positive
"there's nothing quite as annoying as trying to play a game like this on your screen alone with zero controller support. why you devs make these really amazing games, polished to a gleam and then botch the whole thing being lazy and not including a controller option, you guys are better than this, come on. other than that serious flaw, it's a better than most game and quite fun.",Positive
"Although this might be a ""review"", I have decided to express myself for saying a simple ""Thank you"" that I have played this since the start of the game's launch date. Now... I will depart on this journey to play this game for personal reasons. Thank you to Star Rail creators for making this game trully amazing. And I will be back in the future, when possible. Farewell. ü•≤",Positive
"Love this game! The gameplay is super engaging and the story telling and world is super amazing! The game made me pretty emotional at times, think it made me cry two or three times lol. Sure it will make me more as I continue playing! That's a sign of a good story!",Positive
"Awesome game, I'm very obsessed with the quality, animations, resources, etc. However the storage required is a bit depressing. And I'm sad that this might be the final version I get to play due to my phone's low capacity...is there any other way to play the game without taking much storage perhaps?",Negative
"It's an alright game, the combat is unusual and interesting, the characters they've taken from the other game and the NPCs are quite bland and also rather predictable. Idk how long I can cope with hearing them mispronounce ""Seele."" The stelaron traveler (whatever we are to call ourself) is so incredibly two faced or dull with dialogue, I don't want or need a long lecture about things I'm not going to remember I just wanna grind items, fight things and level up characters.",Negative
"Honestly I love it. Big part of that prbly is due to being lucky when I returned to the game during the anniversary but I love everything about this game. Soundtrack, to animations, to personality of the characters. If I was to ask for anything different it would be to do collabs with other ip's. Whether that be from animes or other games doesn't matter to me, outside of fanservice the units would sell like fresh hot cakes. Nothing is ever perfect but this game is Def 9.5/10.",Positive
It's like the devs actually listen to player base. Story is becoming more and more interesting. The gameplay is very interesting and what keeps me coming back. (also the rewards and story too now (edited story parts) üíØ),Positive
Very good game. I love the turn based system in this game .The game is also very rewarding. The character designs are very unique and cool . Love that there are more game modes to test out your characters.,Positive
"Amazing game, unplayable however because it takes up so much storage on my phone. The storage size increases with every update as well meaning even if you delete every other app on your phone so you can play this, the following month it will be updated and it won't be possible for you to play it. Still a great game, but plan on playing it on pc or ps5 before making purchases.",Positive
"Very well crafted turn based rpg. The character design and story is stellar. The only down side is the gacha element bit even as f2p if you plan ahead you can get the units you want. You will become attached to the astral express and it's crew, the story that unfolds is simply amazing!",Positive
"This is my favorite game, period. It is SSS tier for characters, story, gameplay, exploration. The dialogue is so witty and fun. The developers have clearly poured all their love into the details that make HSR so vibrant and engaging. It absolutely deserves every accolade.",Positive
"It is a good game, but my gacha luck is horrible in it. Every 5* took me 70+ pulls. When I lost the 50-50 for Fu Xuan at 75 pity, it was the final straw. I had originally started playing because it gave more pulls then Genshin every patch, but I don't see any difference with its abysmal drop rates. There are also times when it crashes before starting. As this all coincided with WuWa launch and I got some good pulls there, HSR is the one to go.",Negative
"The game is already good based on story, grapich and else. But major problem is iquilibrium level can't be downgrade or lower. Now with lv 66, i can't progress version 2.2 boss because it so strong for my character. Basicly free to play player and who just play to enjoy game is struggle to progres story just because boss level is too high for us to handle.",Negative
"this game is very good and interesting. The characters in this game have a good design and graphic quality. The storyline is also fun and easy to level up trailblazers. even so i wish this game had co-op so i could play with my friends. however, I hope this game has more updates in the future",Positive
"An exceptional standard setting turn based gacha game, where even if you don't pull any characters, you can still clear all the contents with enough investment and skills. Power creep still exist but it isn't as bad as other competing gachas.",Positive
I love this hsr it really easy for me and more fun to save up and the quest are more fun to do and all the characters have a unique design and gameplay and the trailer for all the characters are Amazing,Positive
"Well made but disappointing immersion. Story is paced awkwardly with Dan Heng's story being told in a split narrative as early as planet three plus the transition to Imbibitor Lunae's integration into the story being clumsy, and characters quests range from what I consider well made (Natasha) to ones where nothing happens. World building is good but has many unfortunate breaks (Seele's dress, QED.) Has a handful of deep side quests but ultimately still not enjoyable. Gameplay is great.",Negative
"I love this game, since this game released I continue to plan this until now, the story keep me going and the dailies didn't pressured me to go on long hours because of the turn based and auto play....",Positive
"Pls fix pc version i cant download it properly it keeps on crashing and freezing my computer ive checked my system requirements or graphics requirements either it fits and also i already installed it before, ever since the 2.1 update ive been having issues downloading, i really like the gane i hope i can continue playing on pc thabks",Negative
"It's honestly a really fun game, I enjoy interacting with characters and receiving nice rewards every patch. The characters also feel very alive and have so much lore that you could compare them to real people.",Positive
"High quality turn based game which I like. But the Favourism toward some Characters is a bit too much (Have 4-5 PV , short anime , Backstory and content that tailor made for them while some Characters have only 1 PV)",Positive
Look I absolutely love these game with all my heart and I'm not here to complain about the boss or wtv. I'm here because there are now 50 (playable) characters in game and only ONE of them has a darker skin tone. Yes there are POC NPCs but come on now. please I want more characters that aren't just paper white I want at least a little diversity!! this game takes place in SPACE,Negative
"I loved playing this game and it's amazing! Each character bond's with others and you get some emotional experience here an there. I will say however, I'm a little stuck after reaching the highest level 80 and can't go any higher, Every enemy is between level 81 to 82 making it difficult for me to beat them.",Positive
Horrible character and light cone (weapon) rates. Pulling the gacha is a miserable experience! Not fun. Penacony update: i regret coming back!! That last boss was utter garbage! I genuinely enjoyed the story and cutscenes - THE FIRST DAMN TIME! YOU MADE THE BOSS SO DIFFICULT THOSE UNSKIPPABLE STORY SEQUENCES AND CUTSCENES BECAME OBNOXIOUS! I NOW HATE THE STORY IN ITS ENTIRETY JUST BECAUSE OF THAT BOSS!!!,Negative
"Such good quality and the story quests are so interesting and fun to do. Exploring is so easy to do and the characters' personalities, art, lore and background are absolutely extraordinary",Positive
"Game is fun and the characters are super cool, however, the company that made this is extremely colorist/possibly racist (they have included a lot of culture in another game of theirs, but made all of them white as hell, whitewashing that culture, and giving darker characters worse kits.) Game is fine to play, since it's free. But do not give them your money.",Negative
Definitely 10/10 game dude! The damn cutscenes is so good it give me goosebumps. I've never been this excited over a turn-based RPG before. The story is good. The waifus is gorgeous. The ost is good (everyone know that). Gacha system... normal i guess. Npc conversation is interactive. I don't know why i always get so emotional when I beat the boss tho. I've completed this game after 23 days maybe less idk. FKN 10/10 GAME WOOOOOOOOOOO. Looking foward for the next update :D (pls give me firefly),Positive
"gameplay is great, but it's suffocating to play especially the penacony main quest that bombs you with too much dialogues, would be great if there's a skip button.",Negative
"Im gonna start by saying I love this game. It's a fantastic concept with well written characters and most importantly it's fun. That said, Hoyoverse's colorism prevails, leaving me disappointed. Everyone deserves to see themselves in characters in their favorite game. Everyone deserves to be represented. Diversity is the bare minimum.",Negative
"The game is great, but I just hope that there will be an option to lower your equilibrium level honkai star rail. Because the boss is really hard to defeat, even with a good 5 star.",Positive
"Using too much memory capacity for my phone The game play is very good, I don't mind but maybe because the graphics produced cause too much memory usage and the cellphone used requires more other applications so sorry maybe I will delete the game.üôèüèªü•π",Positive
"Completely boring, lack of diverse character designs, played 15 minutes of it and got bored of it. I'd rather not spend my money here or on any hoyoverse games.",Negative
"Switched from Genshin to Star Rail and I guess it was a good decision, I don't regret it. The storyline is great ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú® and you even get free 5-star, 4-star characters! But my bad I missed free Dr. RatioüçÉ",Positive
"Started playing Zaneless zone, Honkai and their new game have been absolutely phenomenal been playing for awhile with my brother, we have such A great time talking about the game. Honestly wish I had more space to give A larger review, but from when I started I wanted more from them and they've delivered I cannot recommend this game enough, aswell as the new one as I mentioned, you need to save for who you want, but you should have fun ‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
One of the best gacha game to ever exist. I having been playing this game for a long time and have unlocked a lot of 5star characters unlike genshin honkai star rail gives good rewards and have great story and world building.,Positive
"So fun! Characters,the storyline and freedom of the game are amazing! In my opinion I think the storage is worth it.if your like me and wondering if you should get genshin impact or Honkai starrail I strongly suggest u get Honkai.hope this helps :D",Positive
"the game is good over all, but I just want to put you guys on one star due to your new divergent universe content where everything relies on rng and one wrong occurrence can ruin your entire run. other than that great game",Negative
"I really like the gameplay and the character design, but I am deeply disappointed about the lack of diversity in skin tones. The only character with a darker skin tone is Arlan, and his skin looks ashy compared to the skin tones of real people. I want to enjoy the game, but it is hard when I can't see myself in it",Negative
"Add a dialogue skip button, I'm not interested in watching clowning for more than 10 minutes, 1 dialogue and I have time to make myself dinner. I'm not interested in the plot of the pinakonia, it's not the logic and stupid actions that you impose that annoys me. MAKE A DOT TO SKIP DIALOGUES !!!!",Negative
"Bloody well done of a game. Best devs ever. They're not afraid to break their own rules and this in turn makes the game more exciting. They have done everything even world's biggest money hungry game studio titans don't even think of doing for their player base. And thus much more love for the team. Great story, great visuals, Beautifully written Characters, out of the box ideas, creative, inventive world building, its a never ending list of good things.",Positive
"I really want to play it but it's 30 GB :( This game seems so cool but I literally have so space for it üò≠ I hope the future of games isn't lile this, it'll be impossible to have anything else on my phone",Negative
"I love the game , But seriously why 2,71GB needed? i really love the game , but the update is literally need 2,71Gb i cant do that! , I literally have pictures & apps that are important!!",Positive
Great game. This game has better story and characters than many AAA games out there. The game is really fun. I also love the overall aesthetic and ambience.,Positive
Recently I often get stuck at the first screen when first entering the app. I can't start the game and even after several tries it doesn't let me load in,Negative
"I love this game. You are fighting with your characters. Game lets you talk with other people, buy something, chat with characters, or add a real person to friendü©∑ I am giving 5 stars‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",Positive
"Best cutscenes,story is very good, characters design üî•üî•very good, but the relics system is trash and pls let me win atleast 1 50-50 I have to collect 150-160 pulls for a single banner üò≠ hoyo show some kindness",Positive
"so many characters but only one with dark skin, who also just so happens to have a horrible kit üôÅ other than the blatant racism, the gameplay is nice and the story is intriguing most of the time",Negative
"Good rewardings, challenging puzzles, good storyline, and most of all one of the best turn based gacha game that I ever play.",Positive
Its a great game but im stuck on a certain quest everytime i try to fight them my screen freezes and it kicks me out of the game,Negative
"Based game, cool game, but powercreep is reeal, as well as character checks in events, so not perfect but based in turn based rpg, so cool!",Positive
"Love this game and how generous the game developers are, but the lag issue is quite a letdown for the game in my opinion. But overall, good game.",Positive
"Amazing game, I've been playing for 2 months and i found no problems. UNTIL... My trail blaze level is too high and is now at equilibrium 5, and the problem is i can't defeat the bosses in penacony because the bosses are too strong ( because i can't lower my equilibrium ), so now im stuck and can't progress, please give us the permission to lower the equilibrium",Negative
This is my favorite game however the lack of brown and black characters especially in a planet inspired by the Jazz age (TRAILBLAZED BY BLACK PEOPLE) is incredibly disappointing. Especially the only tan character has distasteful skill/talent names. Do better.,Negative
I love playing the game! I do hope that it'll have a similar feature to Genshin where you can uninstall old resources.,Positive
"Fully voiced main story with a cast of diverse and interesting characters, engaging turn-based combat system and varied gameplay. Even the business model is kept pretty fair and doesn't push the real money shop on you at every turn like in many other gatcha style games. While the premium currency can get pretty expensive each new (semi-monthly) update will generally let you earn enough of it to at least get most or even all of the new characters.",Positive
"This game is so much fun to play. But the problems are, when a CG starts playing, it's so laggy and choppy. It really quite ruins the game experience. Everything else is definitely a 10/10. Story, character design, music and quality. The CG are the only problem i have even though i only play in the medium settings. I really hope this will be fixed soon since I'm very invested in Penacony's story right now.",Positive
"Games fun I love games that have interesting stories like this.This game is also pretty hard and most of the time is a puzzle but the puzzle is not bad but for the people who just started playing this it will be kinda difficult most of the time to level up.Tbh is not,if you pay intention on the tutorial,you can understand alot of thing and probably can go through the games.So I recommend you to watch the tutorial and don't skip any important details.",Positive
Can you guys manage the amount of storage I need to use to download this like I love the game I just don't have enough storage to download it again if you guys can't fix it it's fine I'll buy a chip storage for my phone maybe next year i won't lower my rating of this game just because the amount of storage I need to download it it's crazy how good this game is,Positive
I saw from a add if I download it I would get 80 free puls never got and it said to new plays which I tryed with a new account never got it and also I had an account that had saved data and I had good character but some how I never got the data back and I logged into three accounts I login with and with every single contry never found the data again so who ever reads this don't play this game even thoughs it's good it as huge down falls and false advertising in there adds,Negative
"This game is most addicted rpg game in my mobile experience due to the reason that it has good story lore, great characters and good occasional event rewards (which could be increased in my opinion) . My problem is , it has less story main missions compared to genshin impact, please work on that, otherwise the game is great üëç. Keep up the good work team.",Positive
Please listen to your audience and fix the issue with the lack of skin tone diversity of the Natlan characters. The designs are currently lacking and bland due to this issue and I and many others will not continue to support the game.,Negative
"FANTASTIC GAME. THIS is a perfect balance of a casual experience with also more hardcore difficulty options. A great balance of acquiring necessary stats and strength without being too precise in the build you are trying to aim for. The stories are amazing, characters and musicuch better than Genshin, and has better optimization on mobile devices. Also is more F2P friendly while the company treats the players here well. I LOVE this game.",Positive
"Easily the best mobile game I've played. The story immersion is wonderful, the maps are diverse and eye catching, and the latest 2.0 update is enthralling both in the newly introduced cast of characters and gameplay. The game is also generous to F2P players, which makes me more inclined to monetarily support. The biggest issue with this game is dialogue being unskippable as well as cryptic at times, but such is the norm in this genre. Artifact RNG is also painful, a substantial grind. 9.5/10.",Positive
"very fun game, been enjoying it a lot. story is nice and the game is smaller than other game titles by hoyoverse, plus the visuals are still very nice and good music too- especially boss fights. id have to say my biggest gripe is not always having a dialogue option i want to actually choose, but that's not a big deal. had to turn down graphics but i play on mobile so it is what it is lol",Positive
"Honestly THE best mobile game of the century. I have played since day 1 and even though I was initially hesitant due to the turn-based style, it has such incredible and enriching gameplay. Every story and planet/space ship is so well thought out, and I could honestly get lost playing this game for hours. I spend most of my free time playing. <3",Positive
"Absolute cinema, the main story from this update was one of the most well written storylines I've experienced in a while. Gameplay awesome as always. Don't sleep on this game! Pros: + Unique combat mechanics and strategies + Endgame content and many gamemodes + Good QoL changes + Unique exploration experience + Engaging story",Positive
It has been quite a journey with this game. 14 months and counting. I'm not comfortable playing action games from my phone so HSR has been pretty godsent for me with its top quality of production. Happy to pick up the best game Hoyoverse can offer.,Positive
"it's great at first, but as soon as you get to around 70 team level, the game comes to a grinding halt. it pulls you in with fast rewards and items to get you going for quite a while then it takes it all away. and makes you pay money to keep the momentum. it's not just slightly slower, it's a grinding halt. waiting 2-4 days just to get 1 ascension. it doesn't give enough way to get the materials you need. true to it's gatcha name, was willing to spend more money until the brick wall happened",Negative
"A great, free to play turn based RPG with optional premium resources, excellent graphics, gameplay and story, a lot of regularly updates content, cross play between multiple formats you may own, all round great experience and well worth playing!",Positive
"Its a fun rpg game, the combat system is easy to figure out and the story is amazing. Some fights and bosses are hard but that give you something to work towards in terms of upgrading your team and thinking of a strategy, and once its all done its satisfying to see them go down. The story is entertaining and gets me hooked to know what comes next.",Positive
"They repeatedly screw over Male character kits, or powercreep male characters the patch after. There's no consideration for making male characters powerful, and only female chars get to be generalized, op team options.",Negative
"Best Mobile game I have ever played! The story, characters, and maps are phenomenal. Gameplay is simple to understand but incredibly fun and there is lots of endgame content. The dev team listens to player feedback and gives Quality of Life features nearly every update. You do not need to whale to get a lot of characters(I started 2 months post launch, only spend ~$15/month for Battlepass and daily login bonus, and am only missing 7 out of the 40+ characters available in version 2.0).",Positive
I like the game but. I'm always stuck at the train loading screen hope you can fix it and reduce the file too.,Negative
"One of my favorite games. The story is an indescribably wonderful concoction of sci-fi and fantasy elements; absolutely tantalizing. Not to mention the beautifully stunning character designs! The turn based aspect is fun and convenient. My only complaint is the gatcha aspect- I feel like I never get many 4* characters, a lot of 4* weapons, and it takes 75+ pulls to get a 5 star, BUT, you have a 50/50 chance unless you failed last time. So, ~180 pulls for a banner 5*... oof.",Positive
"Weird wall disappearing glitches, low framerate, not optimized? This is 100% my game of choice if you're a psychopath who likes their games like if it was being cooked in an Oven, i can 100% tell you HSR is a love-hate-love experience simply by how annoying and loveable the characters are (FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SHUT UP TOPAZ) and the fact it only takes 1 quarter of my storage is a Yes to me, so try it, it won't hurt you, i promise.",Positive
"Excellent turn based combat reminiscent of Persona. Slow to start, it reminds me of the intro of a JRPG, but if you give it time you will be rewarded with one of the best gatchas out there!",Positive
This isn't fair I was able to get into the game ONCE but than when I closed the app it keeps giving me a error when logging in. I feel like I just got into a scam they toke my Google fine but I can't play I don't feel like this is a safe game I think it will install viruses edit: so I reinstalled it and even hooked up a new account BUT THE SAME EXACT error message came up I can teveb play it no wonder they need to give people free stuff to install there but it wont matter because you can't play,Negative
"Hi,im on a quest in Penacony where im still spending time with Firefly,and it keeps lagging at certain point in the dialougue... I've tried to restart the app multiple times and it still won't work...i could only say it here cause everytime i enter the game it brings me straight to the start of the dialogue...",Positive
Star rail is my favorite game but it takes an unnecessary amount of storage. It was taking 35GB on my phone. I'm sure the devs can think of a better solution for this but so far all our complaints have fallen on deaf ears,Negative
"First the game absolutely amazing... graphic, performance, and gameplay is fantastic!!! But i only notice this recently... why this game taking data usage soooo muchhhh... much much more than genshin or honkai impact 3rd... please fix this hoyo... this is really fatal flaw in game mobile...",Positive
"Yeah,i used to love this game,but all the latest quest has become so hard to beat with the enemy having ability to recover multiple time or adding allies unlimitedly..Maybe i will uninstall it soon",Positive
"I think the new planet is cool, but the bosses like Sunday and Aventurine are too strong and hard to deal with for free to play players, Aventurine's bossfight took me 3w to finish, and Sunday's boss fight is too hard, it likes the game isn't even playable if you don't have strong characters like Fu Xuan or Acheron. Acheron is way too hard to build for free to play players, which sucks a lot. Sunday on the other hand, is too strong and needs to be nerfed many times. The shield breaks too easily.",Negative
"Best gacha game I've played. Casual friendly and amazing world interactivity. Feels like a persona style overworld exploration but set in space, classic JRPG battle system and great story so far. I look foward to how they make this game even better üíõüíõüíõ",Positive
"I love the game, but the game crashes before I can even get into it, I open the game, it starts updating and then crashes after about 5-10 seconds, making it completely unplayable, I'm also on a new phone, and my phone is a Moto g54",Positive
The game has a semi-open world. It's like Genshin but you can't jump and can't climb. The reason why I dun really like this game is that it's turn based. The game is pretty well-made. Gotta admit.,Negative
"Great game but relic rng is insufferable, the odds are heavily, heavily weighted against you, you'll likely never get a good set for a charcter or it will take years. Such a shame. If they fixed this I would give 5 stars but it's so tiresome day after day getting useless items being unable to improve your charcters.",Negative
I love this game. Wonderful storyline and top tier animations. Characters seem super real and their designs... don't even get me started on that.,Positive
"Man what a game. Stellar gameplay that is also addicting the characters are all fantastic, despite their short screen time. Another great one Hoyo. Well done.",Positive
"my account got stuck after talking to npc, all the sudden the screens goes black for no reason, when i log to my other account, the game still working well.when i switch back to my original account, the game turns black screen again. please help fixing this issues please.",Negative
The system feels overly greedy and lacks rewarding outcomes. It's disheartening for players like me who just want to enjoy the game without feeling financially drained. The focus on money feels excessive and disappointing.,Negative
"Turn base game but the story is more time consuming. Tiring events, too much time consuming. not friendly for people who has works. No skip button, bad events.",Negative
The patch update for every version is getting annoying. It takes too much time unlike the update in genshin. Now its 13gb just to update the current version.. I'm very disappointed on how you guys handle this.,Negative
"This game had amazing character design and animations, quests are fun too. However takes up more than 30 GB in my storage.",Positive
"Love the game but has a bug because it keeps reloading while I'm battling, and I haven't been able to play.",Negative
"I really like the game, but I hate the fact that you can't jump. Other than that, the characters all look really good, and the story is pretty interesting.",Positive
"hsr is nice, the character stories and designs r amazing. and graphics are amazing. At first the battle style felt clunky but I got used to it. honkai star rail feel like fresh air after playing genshin tbh. BUT HOYO PLS MAKE SUNDAY PLAYABLEüôè",Positive
I really love the game and the honkai lore..but for the love of God please let me delete the past quest resources..I am planning on playing ZZZ but this game takes 30gb of my phone..genshin has been out for more than 3 years and it only takes 18gb on my phone despite being an open world game.,Negative
"I love this game with my life. Literally saved my life anyways I like the lore of characters, please hoyo make more interesting yet sensitive topics based lore! Ali the trailblazer!!! May this journey lead us starward! I've been playing since the first day of release",Positive
"I honestly can't find a single thing wrong,can be a bit annoying at times but then again so can everything else only time will tell if they follow genshin's downward spiral or choose to keep up their current approach",Positive
"Good game overall, good story and a fun take on turn based combat. Trying to keep up with the meta is very hard without spending a lot of money",Positive
"Game Is very enjoyable, people who can't beat bosses are highly skill issue in this game. They given us trial character for every event and story mode. F2P friendly and easy to play.",Positive
Great game.good story and characters.It runs good on my android.I think it should have a jump and dash button.And it sometimes lag on cutscenes.i hope you can fix it.thanks,Positive
"Each update increases the size way to much, its always a 5-8gb increase every 1.5 months and its getting tiring having to empty out so much storage over and over again, why isn't there an option to delete past quest resources like Genshin Impact has",Negative
"I am in love with this game!!! I love the story, characters, combat, everything! Been playing since launch and I must say, the devs treat their fan base well!",Positive
"It's the first turn-based gacha game I'm playing. Current Penacony updates are incredible. Good gameplay, great graphic. Overall, F2P can survive on this gacha game like Genshin. Still, the 50/50 will get you sick.",Positive
Whats wrong with the updates recently? I just played the new simulated universe when its all pitched black then i had to close the game. And now im stuck at the loading screen after logging in. Any help??,Negative
"Very fun and love the graphics by a lot, The bosses are hard but yet still more fun to do then classic bosses from other Games <>.",Positive
"Hoyo game this day make me mad, i login to honkai star rail after few days log out, i put the right email and password and YET the game say either my email or pasword is wrong, all hoyo game is the same, even hoyolab, i have to either do register account or forgot password, and now my honkai star rail account got freeze?? Are you kidding me? I put the right email and pasword many time, fix YouR sytEm, maybe it just me who experiences this but Fix It, its So AnnoyING",Negative
"The recent update is very one sided. Why is a company cartering to the needs of a Certain fanbase and completely ignoring the Needs of other fanbase? How can you justify The blatant favouritism of Community over the many others? Did you guys forgot that People like both Male and Female characters? The direction you guys are taking with the game, it seems like you want to make it more restrictive & wants to decide for US what we should be doing. It's very unsatisfactory.",Negative
"Everything in this game so good. Music, story, enviroment and characters design is perfect deserve five star from me I hope I can give more.",Positive
"It is better now, little crashes. But why do the cutscenes crack even at low settings every single time, but other hoyoverse games don't. Please fix it. Please allow yours to delete past events and resources. This game is 27g of space while genshin is 18g. And genshin is bigger scale than honkai star rail",Negative
"This game is so fun, fantastic lore, love the chareters, a big fan of the gameplay, the mc has a voice, and they have some funny easter eggs there, and pop culture memes. They don't take themself tooo seriously",Positive
"When I first started playing this game I thought it'd be lame, but I've played it for a few hours and it's awesome. Actually listening to the story will improve how much you have fun with the game. 5/5 do recommend.",Positive
"This game is well in and of itself but it feels very storage-consuming to me, I wish the devs add the selective data deletion like in hi3 already so we don't have to get all of the unneeded space for this single game",Negative
"I love the game and its story. I've stopped plenty of times, but I keep coming back because of the feeling i get in this game is unique. There is no game that can give me the same feeling as this game does.",Positive
"Genshin in space, with tedious turn based combat. Characters and writing are cringe-inducing; everything is a trope, everything is predicable. Gacha system is fairly forgiving, I guess.",Negative
"Indeed, it's a very good game. It would be 5 stars if it has the ""clear old quest data"", this game is actually eating up my storage TOO MUCH. Pls add the feature asap.",Positive
"Alright so, I've seen a lot of 1 star reviews saying that honkai star rail has too overleveled bosses which gets harder every time, yes I can approve this is right but this does NOT mean that you can just rate it 1 star, I get that maybe your build literally sucks and that it's not the game's fault for YOU having terrible builds, so please think before you even take a review üò≠",Positive
"Really good game, fun dialogue choices, and nice voice cast. Always love a strategy game. Peak Penacony Story, can't wait for more.",Positive
Non skippable tutorials earn 1 stars instantly. Especially dislike Penacony storyboard. Stealing me away from the best fight in the game and forcing me to listen to a drawn-out rant from a slimy 2-bit toad was the worst possible choice.,Negative
"there's a bug, after completing a battle with enemy always turn to loading blank screen on my phone. please fix it.",Negative
"The game is good but the only thing I can't stand are the novel like long dialogues. 1 mission feels like watching an entire Tarantino film, minus the action, just full on dialogue.",Negative
"Great game i love it. The only problem is the size, it already larger than genshin thats been running for 4+ years. Please do something",Positive
"So, the game is amazing and all, BUT it's kinda sad that I need to uninstall and then reinstall the game for every update because it needs such a big storage.",Positive
"To be honest, the game is good but the amount resources they make us download after every update is a lottt, players from every platform should enjoy this game but mobile players like me aren't able to because of the large downloading size",Positive
"Great game, can we have a keyboard button for pc players for autobattle? So we can turn it on and off easily and not have to click with mouse?",Positive
I Love Honkai: Star Rail I Like The Combat Skills And Fighting Skills Are Awesome And I Love All Of The Characters in Honkai: Star Rail Amazing Game To Play I like The Events and Challenges and The Open World Is amazing I Love Taking Photos and Seeing The Awesome View of everything Unlocking 5 Star Characters and Level up Them and also Can't Forget To Level up The 4 Star Characters as well,Positive
"What the fish is this, I using my Google account to login the game. When I login my account is gone, everything start over again at the starting? What the hell is this. All my data are gone, well done man. Good job wasting of my time to play.",Negative
"Probably my favorite turn based RPG. This is a proper video game, and not typical gacha slop. Hoyoverse has ruined mobile games for me. HSR is the gold standard as far as I'm concerned.",Positive
I love this game and I want to play on Asia server on PlayStation but I can't so I had to start over on America server. I would play more if you could switch your server on PlayStation. Same for genshin,Positive
This game is just.. absolutely amazing. The story is so immersive and the graphics are beautifully done.,Positive
I'm not disconnecting anymore and the game is awesome the storyline is deep and dang it I can't stop playing this game I love it the only thing is I wanted to get some character but haven't got her yeti,Positive
Games keeps on crashing on the third phase of Abundant ebony deer boss fight in Divergent Universe. No problem with other bosses. I can't progress.,Negative
"Good game, shame ZZZ has borked graphics on my phone. HSR have this one settings to enhance fps for my devices, graphic modes. Hope they change minimum requirements for ZZZ",Positive
Im gonna have to give it a 4 cause it would be better if you could type your replies not in messages but also when chatting with Npc's add that option for like 50 stellar jade and I'll change it to a 5,Positive
"I fully downloaded the game last patch. Ask me to download 13gb after the 3gb update. Game is already 20gb on my phone. Seriously, this happened to me with genshin too. I thought this game will be more advanced than GI. I was wrong. It's a sickness to all hoyo games.",Negative
Cant skip dialog or cut scenes. Takes ages to do anything because everyone tells you how special a rock is for no reason.,Negative
Hello HSR if you see this comment why 1 star review yes i love the game but in the story sunday boss is kinda hard to me as matter fact i don't have archeron or adventurine to be support and dps i have only danhe but i need sparkle to my team but since the story need main character well kinda hard yes i have skill issues but i tried so many time to defeated the sunday but i cant i hope you will give an adjustment of the boss and have easy game play and i can continue to farm for firefly build,Negative
"Getting laggy lately even using SD 8 Gen 3 Phone (iQOO12), hope the game can fix it. Even Genshin Highest 60fps do fine with my phone but not this game with Medium 60fps.",Positive
Really love this game but the fact that the gacha system is extremely good in Europe server makes me leave a 4 star on this game... Other than the europe server all other servers are trash in terms of gacha system,Positive
I downloaded this game and waited ages for the updates only to be stuck with a black screen when entering the game after the train takes off.,Negative
"Love the game, but I personally have difficulty defeating bosses in the main story. I'm more of a casual player, who doesn't invest too much time in playing the game, so I don't actually have that many characters nor do I have many of them built. I can't defeat the bosses so I can't continue playing the story, which is really annoying. Please give us the option to lower the difficulty.",Positive
A great game. Good characters. I started playing nearly 1 week ago and I really like this game but the saddest part is that it's has very low quest to do. Like now I only have the main quest to do. And like chest amount are low. Hope you give more quest to new players and add more chests in the game. And plz lower the enemy level or higher the team damage,Negative
This turn based strategy game with a lot of honkai universe mystery really hit my own thoughts. Beside that the ads give me more entertaining whenever a new character has a great show of their own stories that always catch my own interest. I really like this one and stick with it.,Positive
The Sunday boss is too overwhelming against people with unbuilt characters even if I have available characters that can match to it's weakness break but due to it having 3x shield and even if anyone tried to brute force the boss the boss's hp only drops from 100-99 at least try nerfing the boss damage or reducing the shield,Negative
Very expensive if you want to get any chance to roll even ten times for a possible nothing burger you have to pay. Hardly any opportunities to get star rail passes with out spending money. This game really started to suck and became woke ASF when they added Penacony,Negative
It's so good and I really love the game but i keep waiting on the downloading resources and others but I love it and I really love the characters I wish I could pick mine I appreciate it,Positive
I lost 5 consecutive 50/50 I only won once. I grind so hard just to get the characters I want but losing 50/50 are discouraging. I don't like to play this game anymore,Negative
"It's officially been a year since I played this game, and I didn't expect to be so into it. Mainly because I am not interested in playing turn-based games. The only downside is that I'm using a low-end device so it's frustrating to always delete some stuff in order to update the game. I hope they'll add the option to delete previous quests soon. Other than that, I'm really enjoying it right now, especially the main story. It really gave me the hype I had when I first played honkai impact 3rd.",Positive
"Your game is good. I've been playing it since launch. The one issue I think everyone can agree on is the resources needed to level up a character's abilities and items. The drop rates are abysmal. I have many characters I want to level up, but I can't because I never have enough XP books or energy. Let's not forget: Why are the boss rewards only available 3 times a week? It's so frustrating! If any developers are seeing this, please get rid of the energy system. Plain and simple.",Negative
How can a game be auto and still take 10+min to complete a fight? Idk but it's pretty. Great if u need a time sink and don't plan to use ur device or have a spare,Negative
"Awesome semi-open world game that is very enjoyable. I'm very happy that u don't miss out on rewards often even though I don't have much time to play it on working days. Characters and well put together, lore is good too, combat is turn based but still requires strategy. Super cool game, great animations! Edit: the game after a certain point does feel like more of a grind, that is the one down side of it being semi- open world and turn based. It isn't as interactive as some other games:(",Positive
"The battle systrm is horrendous. Genuinely can't progress past Aventurine's boss. Takes too much time and I die before I even finish the second or first round. The bosses just keep getting harder, even though I am on level. Not to mention the fact that the story either takes forever or is too quick. There's barely any redeeming qualities for this game anymore- I'll stick with lore summaries, thanks.",Negative
"I love this game! The art, the characters and the amazing powers and abilities, the well-written story, the difficult decisions, the roleplaying, everything. It's just beautiful! PS: I'm memorized and in love with the characters powers in battles.",Positive
"The game is good, persona-esque gameplay, good art. After less than 8 months of play there's very little to do, I've completed all missions and side quests, and grinding for exp is only via certain areas that require a lot of time to regenerate the currency needed to enter (or you can pay for it, obvs). The game would be SO much better if you could level characters or gain TB exp through random battles which would give a reason to continue exploring and trying out otherwise shelved characters.",Positive
"The game is very good! I really love it, The graphics, designs, plot! Nailed it! However I'm having difficulties on passing the stages... Especially in a story quest boss just like Aventurine... I'm a free to play player and I can't progress without beating him... I'm trying to beat him for two hours but I can't... Please consider player's team damage for a boss or else I might delete this...",Negative
"I'm absolutely in love with this game. the characters, look, mechanics and all of the above are great. Although It gets difficult to run the game due to the ult casting and some of the cutscenes. The game is very interesting and engaging, you can get a lot of wishes by grinding for even just a week (never genshin). All jokes aside the game is good just doesn't run as smoothly as I hoped it would. I recommend trying it if I'm honest.",Positive
I would give it a 5 but the map glitches and I don't know if it just happens for me. The map glitching doesn't make the game unplayable it just is pretty annoying. Other then that I LOVE the game. The characters are all so pretty!,Positive
I been playing this game for a year and all I can say is it was very fun and entertaining. There are many challenging aspects like forgotten hall and swarm disaster and gold and gear is very interesting. The lore is interesting as well.,Positive
"Absolutely phenomenal! This is a console-quality experience on mobile, and I can't recommend it highly enough! Gorgeous graphics, solid gameplay, and an intriguing storyline that doesn't get convoluted, plus plenty of achievements that earn credit for gacha. If you're an RPG fan, you won't be disappointed.",Positive
"Okay, so my review is totally biased bc I just adore this game. The gameplay, the character designs, the anime style, and the MUSIC (not talked about enough imo) not to mention, all of the engaging puzzles and missions and my favorite part, the animations and voice acting!! Love this game!! 10/10 in my very humble opinion.",Positive
"I love everything about this, I'm really having the best experience of playing out of all hoyoverse games, especially the story and science fiction is great. But please do something with the relic system it's really inconvenient to get useful relics. I really appreciate all your hard work.",Positive
"Combat is fun and lots of mechanics, wish there was more of that and less ""listen to us yap for ten mins b4 ending the cs only to have to walk 5ft and listen to the same person yap again for 10 more mins"". As a writer, it just is not an efficient or engaging way to tell a story even if its good and has great VAs. A majority of Honkai's cutscenes are the ""this could've been an email"" of the video game world imo",Positive
The game so far has been really good. The main story and the characters are well written and the general endgame content is good. The visuals for the game are pleasing to the eye. Also gives generous rewards to players (including events). Overall experience with the game has been outstanding! Can't wait for future content within the game. (Ps. Genshin could never),Positive
Wonderful game! I came onto here from GI so it was a nice breather of fresh air. Yes the storage needed may be a lot but it's definitely less then Genshin and Honkai impact. And the characters are wonderful! I'm currently on penacony after almost 2 weeks of playing and the characters really are a nice change from Genshin's design team. Overall. The game is great! Just make sure to cache you're files once in a while. Or reinstall when new update comes for more storage!,Positive
"Absolutely amazing, the characters are well designed,the music is so good and the story makes sense and is really fun to play through. Had low expectations since it's a gacha game but the game is playable even without meta characters. This is a well designed gacha game and I seriously recommend to anyone looking for a game with an anime art style :)",Positive
"This game is nice and all but... Am on mobile, and when I first played hsr it was good but when I came back the map was glitching, parts like buildings and mountains and the most noticible the floor and etc keeps dissappearing but when I put the camera at the right angle it will appear and I really want it fixed it is annoying for me",Positive
"This game never fails to entertain and amaze me. There's not a single day where I get bored playing this even if there are no events. Additionally the stories are AMAZING. Even if the Loufu arc was confusing, the rest of the story is great. I'm always eager to wait for the next update for the story continuation since I really can't get enough. Overall this game is great, I highly recommend this for casual or addicted turn-based and rpg players.",Positive
"I love it, personally, the game is very fun and the characters are well built, but what i feel like the most important is the characters builds, i feel like i can't get them right even if i get the light cones. Or its just my skill issue, but alas, this game did deserve the award winning, good job star rail!",Positive
"If you're looking for a turn based rpg, this is the right game for you. After their huge success with genshin impact ( still top grossing revenue), they've delivered another masterpiece. This game is now 1 year old and is right behind genshin in revenue. You'll have fun with this game - long term too. You don't need to spend since they're petting generous with rewards. 10/10 game.",Positive
"Been playing this game since release and I haven't felt any burnout yet, it's just amazing that this game keeps the players satisfied not only with the content and graphics, but the amount of rewards this game gives you, with this, you can get your favorite characters while free to play. That's just crazy",Positive
"As far as played this game I really enjoyed this game gameplay, battle and events mechanism and etc.... is really good but one thing that this game makes me enoyed is that they don't update game very often. After I finish all of the mission and events there are not really things to do and I suggest they gave updates more often or at least make missions last longer",Positive
"Compared to HI3 and GI, Star Rail is a slower, more casual game with a heavier emphasis on presenting the characters, world building, and main storyline. It's an overall stellar game where you (the MC) are given some fun & funny dialogue choices, and the bgm & musical scores are seriously top-notch. Grinding is also a snap since it only takes a few minutes a day without sucking up your time. The only drawback is finishing the enjoyable endgame content & waiting for future patches to update.",Positive
"I love the story and characters, it's worth experiencing for yourself and you can do a lot in the game to be frank you don't need to make purchases unless you want to. The game is lenient and fun to kill time but that's for me your experience might be different. I wish you a good trailblaze.",Positive
"Story is so fun , characters are awesome and the benefits of lvl up and how easy it is to lvl up. Only think Id say is my problem is finding necessary to lvl up character and equipments ECT. Looking through the panels is time consuming. But all in all a great game good job.",Positive
"The graphics and animations are well done the character design is masterfully crafted but the story leaves something to be desired, I started playing this game at launch but now it has become more like a chore because the overall story doesn't have a good hook the only reason I continue playing is to please a friend of mine. Also side note if you want to play any games from this company never interact with the fans most of them are rude and will make you hate the games",Negative
"Best gacha game I've played so far. My friends got me into this game and I thought it was gonna be a bit boring because I'm not really a fan of turn-based games but this proved me wrong. The enemy and hero designs and fighting moves are so cool. Though the game does run okay, as I'm on mobile, it doesn't run as fast and well as on PC and that's the downside but other than that the game is the best gacha game so far",Positive
"Been playing since 26th April 2023 first launched, at first then gameplay is boring when you completed all the quest. Have quit and came back for 2.0 patch, it seems there are more things to do and the new area looks amazing. Overall graphic is good but animations is good only during fighting, I noticed that the new area kids mostly do the same happy jump like Klee from Genshin Impact. The good things about this game is the event will last longer and the rewards are better than Genshin. 8.5/10",Positive
"Considering this game can be played all the way through completely free, I'd say this is game is fantastic! To be fair, I haven't played every free game out there nor have I played a ton of gacha games. Despite that, I'm pretty confident in saying HSR might be one of, if not THE, best free game(s) ever. Engaging story, staggering world(s)-building, loveable characters, simple yet deep combat and what seems like a never-ending supply of content, with more always right around the corner.",Positive
"Mihoyo never fail us this game is much f2p friendly. Graphics: it's great and beautiful at the same time the design of the characters are pretty mature also animation is great Story: For me it's good though not the second part but on the recent update the plot is amazing (plot twist,climax) The only thing I didn't like is it's boring without new content since I'm already mx TL so I have nothing to do when I complete the daily/weekly.",Positive
"It's good and amazing the graphics but I keep getting kicked out so I have to keep on resetting my game... Then sometimes when I open a cutseen my screen goes black and I get kicked out... More commonly I go and open the app to get kicked out so after a few tries it let's me but when theirs a cutseen and I get kicked I also have to open the app multiple times sometimes when it just doesn't work I delete and re-download the app, it's still pretty good it give it a 5 star if I could play normally",Negative
"Everything is good in the game, the Story and the gameplay.. but it have many issue 1. Laggy and crash always, and some times the game just refuse to open until I re-install it but I can't keep doing this 2. It's almost impassible to clear anything it the game if you didn't maxed your characters skills and get the best Relics for them which give the next problem.. 3. The drop rate of materials is very bad and low.. and why only 3 echo of war in week at least make us challenge all 1 time like GI",Negative
"Positively despise the relic system, but everything else is pretty cool. Except some storylines just have characters droning on in a monotonous voice, which makes it harder to care about the story. It's so boring that I find myself wanting to just skip over everything.",Negative
"1st story quest: good 2nd main story quest: meh Penacony: very good After loosing my motivation to play genshin, I decided to give HSR a try, didn't expect much since I hate turn base games, but I was surprised, i actually liked this game. The story, especially Penacony, satisfied me, unlike genshin that slowly deteriorating, HSR gave me a good storyline. Keep it up devs ! PS: I'm also satisfied with the rewards I got, I didn't expect a limited 5 star as a gift. :)",Positive
"Cutscenes are too laggy on my device (I thought they are pre-rendered, then why so slow?). Login error that happens too often (Not everytime, but it's an annoying thing regardless). It's a great game overall, but these minor issues are ruining everything. Otherwise, a 5 star.",Negative
"Very good game, love the events. One thing I would say is that there's too many side missions (and they are VERY long), also the side missions don't reward enough exp. Maybe consider doubling exp gains from side missions and I might do more of them. Otherwise, perfect game!",Positive
Amazing game the story and charchters are great and I have almost zero problems with it. The only issue or nitpick that I have is that sometimes when I try to teleport to a certain area it will force me somewhere else and not like the nearby teleporting I'm not sure why this happens but I hope it can be fixed soon :D,Positive
"Interesting story, but nothing impressive. Fun combat animations, very small amount of interaction in pressing button to fight, auto play and afk pretty much, absurdly good rewards, nice visuals good style. Just not like a main game, feels like a side game to a game you mainly play.",Positive
"A great game with nice characters and storyline. But I can only set my graphics to very low, when I set it higher there's a bug where the surroundings in the game become fully covered with bright white light. Please fix this bug.",Positive
"Famished, Baron and starved. 1 character pull every 2 Days and 2 if you buy the premium pass Great and rewarding story early game but after all's finished you see the game for the money sink it is. Paying is almost necessary for this game unless you like saving pennies to buy a burger You have better odds at a casino or begging for change And the story is a yap fest, many of the characters constantly reiterate themselves or the plot and alot of the voice cast sounds the samet Combat's good.",Negative
"it's an amazing game I highly recommend the story the game play is both fun and interesting it's a normal turn base game but the mechanic and the unique combination u can do whit other characters in combat really takes the cake and there reward and event just keep getting better and better and the lore of the story it's just fantastic amazing writhing and music, scene and more I can't explain how amazing this game is I hope once u play the game u will experience only fun and happiness playing <3",Positive
"BEST TBJRPG in the Play Store. Hands down my favorite game on a mobile device. I haven't been this addicted since Dragalia Lost (R.I.P). Super friendly to FTP. You absolutely do everything in the game, not spending a dime. Plus, the group that's developing this game is amazing. They are extremely generous when it comes to free units and premium currency. Because of these reasons along I'm happy to spend money on the BP and monthly check-in card. Keep it up, guys! Love your work.",Positive
"I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't use the same, miserable relic system that Genshin does. It's still an RNG nightmare to get the stats you want on your character gear. The only saving grace is that at least farming is automated once your characters are powerful enough for you to use the auto battle feature. But yes, I otherwise like it enough that I'm rating it highly despite that, but also hate the feature enough to focus on it...",Positive
"Love the game but I have an issue with the last updates. I'm sorry but making the bosses even wandering enemies a way higher level than the max cap level allowed for characters is unfair, at least raise the max cap level or something because it makes it pretty much impossible to progress any further in the storyline and it's just idiotic to have wandering enemies a way higher level than your max level. Please sort this issue out because it ruins the game",Positive
"The version 2.1 update and all of Penacony main story have been a 10/10. Aventurine and Acheron are the best characters and worth playing the game for, alone. All of Belobog and Xianzhou story were 1/10 and can easily be skipped (they are bad writing and boring) for how good the current rewards and Penacony story is as a game. The game is getting more difficult, but even if you are f2p and new to the game try to get Acheron and Aventurine due to how good they are story/lore gameplay wise too!",Positive
"The game is nice, the graphics are good as hell especially with the cut scenes and designs of characters and their backstory, lore, and the animation of both their skills and ult. I truly love Dan Heng's skill animations, Blade's and so on. Keep it up Hoyoverse!!",Positive
"Great game with great rewards. I noticed that the story is progressing and improved so much. While playing, I've noticed Acheron is kinda bugging... Like her ult got stuck and can't press the AOE button and when entering in battle she kind standing and loading. But overall it's great... This is the reason why I give 4*",Positive
"The devs keep outdoing themselves. They listen and respond with actions every patch. Also the writing keeps getting better and better every arc. Gameplay note: Moc12 is a combination of DPS check and/or making use of game mechanics that are usually tied to the respective banner at the time. Other than that, the gameplay is relaxing for the most part. Please be careful with powercreep, I'll leave more detailed feedback on the next survey (:",Positive
"Can't lie to you, Swarm is a really boring overrated gamemode but the Gears one is a good upgrade. It is way too tedious. Fun game with basic combat, simple and easy dailies are a bonus just wish relic rolls didn't feel so weighted at times. Overall fun game and we wait till Firefly comes home.",Positive
"The game is fun and addicting when i get back into it, but my only thing is i feel like if i dont have the new strongest character the content becomes nearly impossible even with all my current units to their current progression max. This has caused me to be hardstuck for quite awhile now which has lowered my enjoyment and time i've been playing",Negative
"This is an exceptional game, all the characters have nice designs and the story is very good and engaging, though the grinding and farming is too hard, it should be balanced a bit. I am only rating it one star because for this whole month i have not been able to play the game, the screen always gets stuck in the loading screen. I have re-downloaded it but it still doesnt work. When this issue is fixed i will take back my 1star",Negative
It's a turn based game so slow it has to add an auto feature. The battle seems to be stuck in a battle of attrition rather than damage. Edit: the stability of the app has improved a lot but the rating stays the same. Building characters is painful and unsatisfying and you can't use a character until built. Add in the fact we had triple drops for anniversary and no builds were able to update really brings home the bad feeling of playing this game.,Negative
One of the best mobile turn based game! The gacha system is definitely more forgiving than some other games and the story is good! The character design is also really good and not to mention insane graphic for a game available on mobile. It's also really smooth to play. Really nice,Positive
"It's a very interesting rpg game and the characters are really well designed. Though, please add the decrease equilibrium level into honkai star rail just like genshin impact. Me and probably other people have trouble defeating enemies due to our equilibrium level being too high",Positive
"This game is legitimately one of the best experiences I've had. The combat never gets boring, and the music is genuinely up there with some of the best game soundtracks out there. I would definitely recommend it to any gacha or turn-based combat game fan!",Positive
"Only play if you like being held hostage in a ""dialogue"". They bloat them so much that you could start one, put it on ""auto"" (in the few casrs where it actually works and doesn't stop because you have to choose between 2 options that never make a difference) you could watch an episode of a series and still come back to the same dialogue. And since they are stupidly counting time spent in dialogues as spent in the game they think it's a good thing.",Negative
"This game is really fun. Its Genshin impact but turn based battles. Gorgeous graphics and a great story. Also, the boss battles at the end of chapters are jaw-dropping.",Positive
"Love the game been playing for awhile and unlike genshin on mobile it's gameplay is alot better since i feel genshin is better to play on a pc or on playstation but aside from that star rail is a fun game but would love an improvement to primary & sub stat farming on relics it's a pain to get your desired stats on specific relics, and after the 2.1 update on my samsung 24ultra game has been crashing like crazy when logging in hope it gets fixed soon.",Positive
"Amazing and most probably one of the best and well made games for mobile devices. It has Beautiful and stylized Anime gfx. Slick, fast and responsive UI though a bit small text/buttons on a mobile phone. Fast loading times between modes and screens. Great sounf fx and music well suited for even a A rated films. Turn based combat. Good charachter development options with passive skill trees. Beware, it is a huge download for a mobile game, 20GBish.Definitely worth trying, an exellent RPG game.",Positive
"THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!! Not only with a lot of rewards each month and events with tons of rewards, but also good gameplay style, stunning world designs, good characters no matter what rarity. This is by far my most favorite game of all!",Positive
"I had fun for a while, and it does have some interesting mechanics. It's too bad the systems are fundamentally designed to get you addicted and screw you over at every turn. Please steer clear of gacha games and their purposeful predatory games design and business practices. Save yourself a few hundred or thousand hours of your life and play something that actually respects you and your time.",Negative
"The overall quality, in terms of art, story, and animation, is great, but certain aspects of the game are just painful. Limited banners have a 50/50 chance of actually getting the character. After failing 14/16 of the 50/50s in summons, it just makes you miserable. The gear system can also ruin any excitement of getting new characters because of how bad the RNG is. It can take months to get decent gear for a single character.",Negative
"Love those little details, and hopefully my luck here is running smoothly like how Aventurine hair shine. I love the events, the character's story, the places are very distinguished and nice. I love the vibe. The only thing I am sad about is that we can't co-op or join other people worlds, however, everything is pretty well handled! Thanks for this amazing and worthy-to-play game. Loveeee itt! üíõü§ç",Positive
"Story? It's good. Gameplay? It's also good. The characters? BEAUTIFUL. Endless cut scenes? Maybe, can be annoying. But it's very good on mobile, which may be surprising- The only complaint is how much you have to grind üò≠ (I'm not a grindy person) Otherwise I really recommend!",Positive
"I was skeptical about getting into games like this. I hated genshin impact, but gave this game a shot. And first hour in, I was hooked from the story. The first arc was by far, the best story written. The characters are all so amazing. 2nd arc was alright, but 3rd arc seems to bring promise (I'm still playing it, but so far I like it!). Big Sampo fan, I do hope someday he will be shown more in the future, he was the one who made me honestly want to play more because of how silly he is.",Positive
"The Devs on this game are so generous! 1600 stellar jades simply for playing the game through their anniversary, a free 5 star character, countless events and rewards...the list goes on! I have spent money on this game, but that's because I want to support the development of this game and encourage it to become even better! I didn't enjoy Genshin at all, and I couldn't stress enough how much better of a game this is",Positive
"I played this game for a little over a year, It's an honestly fun / addicting game, plus they have: cool characters, fun events, amazing world design, etc. Though sometimes it kicks me off the game so I'd have to rejoin into it, but other than that it's amazing! :)",Positive
"The games story, graphics, and gameplay are great. The reason for the 2 star is that the gatcha aspects are very, very bad. I have been a $5 per month pass player for over a year, and it just isn't worth it. The 5 star pull rate for both characters and lightcones (think signature weapon in other games) is terrible. As for the lightcone rewards for premium path, they aren't even close to worth it. I've finally had it with financially supporting the game and am going back to free to play.",Negative
"It's the best gacha game I've ever played. However, it becomes increasingly lagging update after update. Most phones cannot handle it due to the graphics. Mine even crashed out of the game before it can even enter the game itself",Positive
"Just started playing. I'm only a casual gamer and this game has plenty to keep me occupied. The side quests do make the game, there are so many. And they help with the main story in terms of rewards. And the animation is the best ever. So far so good. Time to trailblaze!",Positive
"The game overally is very good, i play since the release but the game is just not as smooth as it used to, it often jams and animations are just not smooth at all, they just look like singular shots, I don't know what to do, I have much space left on my device + i have one of the newest phones",Negative
"YASSS, this game so perfect! Too bad that I'm a hopeless romantic. There is no romance, actually I've only gotten so far ü•≤ The game is amazing tho besides my weaknesses. The fighting is amazing and the quality is amazing. The game might make you mad by giving you hard bosses on your first trailblaze mission. The characters are really amazing, pretty, and I love the fact that you can be sarcastic in your texts but otherwise this game is amazing and I got addicted pretty fast. Recommended üòò",Positive
"2 stars for now, because, i hear that it's a good game but i can't enjoy it becuase there seems to be a lack of compatability optimization with low end devices, proven by a bug that makes the background transparent, and apparently it's been around for nearly a year now (9 months) but there's still no solution being provided...",Negative
"Possibly the best game I've ever played. Beautiful graphics, amazing story, excellent soundtrack, fun puzzles, not to mention the funny Easter eggs and references. The turn based mechanic is also entertaining. Really hope to see more contents and updates.",Positive
"Despite my prior review, I'm changing it to 5 stars. The game still has issues for mobile player and I do feel bad for those who don't have access to THE PC version but all in all it's still a solid game and the makers actually listen to the player base and are far more generous than their other titles (Genshin and HI3)",Positive
"Gatcha game that is F2P friendly. I enjoy the combat and animations. However, the dialog and pace of story progression is VERY low-tier. Dialog is often bloated with unnecessary words, making reading it a pain. Story progression is so slow, taking almost a year just to add another planet. Endgame content is challenging, allowing you to test your limits and see the results of your built characters.",Positive
"HEY hi there i really love this game so far it's been popular since it came out and I'm also one of the players who played on the exact release date. It's just a pure suggestion the game is fun for sure but after completing an event of story quest we are brought back to our regular (completing dailies and all that) stuff, i wanna suggest snd this is not only for me and for all of us and i know you love us so much, we need something we can invest our time in, similar to genshin an open world.",Positive
"I love the game, but I have one small issue.... I LOST MY PROGRESS! I stopped playing for about a month and came back to it, just to be greeted with the beginning scene of the game! I'm so mad, but the game is amazing!! Update: I GOT IT BACK!! It was just really tricky. :)",Positive
this game has a lot going for it as far as story goes but there are also alot of things that make it unbearable to play at times for example the relic system over the span of about a year I have only acquired a grand total of 4 decent relics and all of them are useless for the characters i mainly use meaning I am unable to play the harder content of the game like memory of chaos I am considering quiting this game altogether but at the same time I just want to see the end of the penecony story,Negative
"I cannot describe how much I love this game. This is one of my favorite games ever. The lore, the designs, the gameplay, the characters, everything about it is absolutely excellent and incredible. Especially for free, and a game you can have on your phone! Hoyo is amazing. They spoil us all the time and is really engaged with the community, to the point of playing with us with inside jokes. I love how passionate they are as we can feel it with such fantastic content (youtube and game). PLAY IT!",Positive
"I very rarely give 5 stars but this one deserves it. It's definitely not perfect like it crashes and had some nice but long cut scenes. But how big it is and how great the game play and story for the low price of free, you can't beat that with a stick üòâ",Positive
"This is probably one of the best mobile games I've played, like ever. It definitely tops the previous hoyoverse games. If you are a fan of HI3, you most likely will enjoy HSR as characters from Honkai appear in the story. Speaking of, I've never paid this much attention to the plot and little details to the story and open world. It's obvious that lots of effort has been put into this game. Though I'm not too much of a fan of turn-based games, I heavily enjoyed the battles. HSR is worth your time",Positive
"I love this game but the problem is they have so many bug. I've been stuck at the black screen many times for more than 10 minutes, the platform of the game is glitching and I barely see the game. Please do fix this bug... It's really hard to enjoy this game with this kind of bug.",Negative
Really like the game I hope I can transfer my account to other devices also an idea maybe you can have a team up ultimate attack and it be nice if you can customize your character to different fight style or get to pick the one you want it be nice to be able to skip cutsceen,Negative
"Problems. Fans that doesn't have good devices really suffer and jist watch online as how good the game is. Graphics issues and the dev teams help is just saying that my device isn't compatible, it has been 2 years and still the game didn't find any solution to this. Compared to Genshin, an open world and 2x larger than hsr, the game works fine with no missing textures and agreeable lag, but hsr is on another story.... Please HSR team fix this issues when the walls keeps flickering.",Negative
"Over a year playin-still not bored.Love the openish world ARPG aspects and turn based combat. I spent a few hundred $, but the game offers tons of free gems with gameplay and gatcha rates aren't terrible-I acquired 6 top tier heroes using free gems b4 choosing to spend for more. The $5 monthly pass supplements earnable free gems nicely, and new content comes out in a new world periodically. There's an excessive albeit interesting amount of collectable documents from each world along the way.",Positive
"Grindy game. Without right team comp, the grind is even worse (you need to be a lot more stronger than recommended level). Herta simulated universe it's just same as elysian realm in HI3rd. Whoever suggested or liked this kind of content, has no life. -- after boring grinding for 2 months, still stuck with story boss. Can't grind materials for some characters.",Negative
Uhm.. did it just me(my device) or the game idk.. but the cutscene keep lagging and stuttering even though it was smooth when i play(walking around/doing quest).. it just keep lagging on cutscene.. i dont know what to do.. i already set my setting to the lowest.. Edit: (nevermind i find the reason.. its because i use 60fps and when i use 30fps the cutscene not stuttering anymore),Positive
"I have been playing this game since it's release, but after a patch my game stop loading environment like floor, wall, roof, etc. This has continue even to the latest patch, no floor just nothing, because of this I couldn't complete one of the important quest which is ruan mei's quest that requires me to place sticker but since there's no floor the game wouldn't let me place any. Without able to complete it, I couldn't unlock the echo or war to get material. Please fix this or find any solution!",Negative
"The character designs, mechanics and the storyline are elite. The graphics are top-notch. Less map restrictions would be nice, like being able to pass through small spaces in terms of exploration.",Positive
"I've been playing this game since the mid 2023 and to this day I am still addicted to it. The storyline is very well written, with the recent update's main quest being, in my opinion, the best so far. They're also very generous with the pull currency and (imo) the pity system is pretty fair. Related to the gacha, 5* characters aren't actually necessary (unless for deep endgame content) and majority of the content can be done with 4* characters.",Positive
"I'm I'm hsr since the start of the game I found it so fun (still do) I really like the Penacony update I'm so excited for the continuing but to be honest I did stop playing hsr for a few weeks because it got boring (during loucha banner) but then I started playing again when Baldes banner was out and since then I've been playing more frequently But the quests are so well put. I love that, and the fighting animations are amazing, and so are the charchter designs! I recommend Honkai Star Rail!",Positive
"After 1 year of playing, the game has exceeded my expectations with the release of Penacony! The world building, the music, and the characters all released since 2.0 are so interesting. Aventurine and Acheron are my new favorite characters. Every new patch has me falling more in love with the game! Happy 1 year anniversary Honkai: Star Rail!",Positive
"I've been experiencing login error since earlier. It cant be because of network connection because my genshin and other games are running just fine. This is not the first time this happened and I hope it can be fixed soon. Also I hope that theres a feature where we can delete past resources like in genshin because for a game that is only at their first year since release, it's already taking so much storage which is a big deal for mobile users like me.",Negative
"The gameplay feels really sluggish at times, compared to other turn-based games Star Rails gameplay feels like it lacks substance. It took until the newest area for the story to get good imo. Its been the only game I've seen where people talk more about rewards (which are nice) than actual gameplay/writing",Negative
"I really enjoy playing it, but- there's a few things I dislike. First off, it crashes a lot and my device is fairly new so its not me, most likely- that's all i got- its an awesome app, I recommend playing it, if you have a lot of free time, ofc :'D",Positive
"The PREMIER RPG of HoYoverse, Honkai: Star Rail is a true RPG with a combat system that will have you right at home with clean and crisp looking UI that is arguably as good, if not better than most AAA console titles. The characters are all memorable and story has impact (no pun intended) for the Astral Express's journey through the stars. Previous Honkai fans will love this addition to the lore of HoYoverse and I cannot wait to see how this game and its universe grows with time!",Positive
"I quit Genshin because of puzzles.. At first launch this games seems like no puzzle at all but, in this latest update puzzle is everywhere.. If you want to go to next level you have to clear the puzzle in the room, the puzzle isn't too hard but enough to make my head dizzy and feels spinning.. Maybe for some people solving puzzle is fun, but not for me I can't do some task that taking too long and make me to go many places it will make my head dizzy. I have to quit HSR. Best game but good bye",Negative
"This game is so amazing and fun!, u have to wait 1/2 hour tho but the fighting skills is so great! The characters are even realistic!, but on lvl 10 I really don't know how to fight them bc is really hard but I hope u can make some new updates!",Positive
Just sick and tired of how Hoyo obviously influences the odds of relic substats rolling into less desirable ones so you're stuck on the farming treadmill for months to get a solid set of gear for **a single character**. It's utterly insane and beyond frustrating. I played both Genshin and Star Rail for a year each and it was a consistent issue in both games.,Negative
Trying to get back into an account I had stepped away from a few months ago. Binded my account to Google but the email I use doesn't have one anymore. Have my user ID though from screenshots. Tried to get a hold of customer support on two separate occasions with no response either time. Starting over wouldn't be motivating after playing for as long as I did.,Negative
"I love the game. The graphics are amazing. I have no issues with the game. What I love the most is there's nothing that sexualizes the women or children. A lot of times when I see anime related stuff, I see sexualized women and young girls. Seeing how this game doesn't sexualize anything makes me love the game and feel very appreciative of this game",Positive
"Incredibly fun, great graphics and story so far, grindy but that's perfectly fine as I enjoy games like that. I would like old event characters to be added to the regular summons and if possible increase the amount of gems earned as the rate for summons is already really low and I normally can only summon once or twice from a summon before the summon disappears.",Positive
"I like this game, more than genshin. And I feel ashamed because of that. I like genshin mechanics and gameplay. But because this game has controler support. I have officially made this my most favorite game. I won't spend money because I spent so much in genshin it makes me feel bad lol. It's strange how they want us to move from genshin to this. Also the in game rewards are also seemingly better. Yet they still made more money recently than Genshin.",Positive
"Global Distribution error, Server Distribution error, Login Error 1001_1 /2 /3....... As I'm Seafarer, I know my connection speed is not too good and stable in the sea. but I can still play Genshin Impact with 999ms ping every day. but not Honkai Star rail, Turn based Game. How much Data speed is just needed to Login and play this game. Really Frustrating. I have to pass every Error phase, and then there is final One ''Login Error''. Reboot.... Reboot....... Reboot.......ü§ï",Negative
"Complete meaningless puzzles for minimal currency just to get a singular character which guess what, is useless unless you get at least two different characters just to make the character even semi-decent. If that's not enough get the same character again just to make it slightly better and get a meaningless png that costs the same and is needed if you want the character to be good. All this for just one team, you need two. TLDR: Don't play if you like being happy, I strongly dislike this game.",Negative
"Amazing graphics, a very interesting story, hot take: I think they should let us get attached to more of the characters then just some. but all in all it's an amazing game would definitely recommend",Positive
"It keeps crashing! I've been playing genshin and hsr on a much cheaper phone and it didn't have any crashing issues but in S23 FE it always does. Already adjusted the settings, display and fps, still the same for a whole year.",Positive
"This game so involved, there's so much content, there's always so much to do. The gacha can be kinda unforgiving, but I could play this game for hours and not get bored. Incredible music, great art style, great characters and storyline, one of the best rpgs I've ever played",Positive
The game is great. I love it but i have a problem with the weekly boss Starcrusher swarm king. The boss is way to strong and the fact the usual mechanic of an ability charging over action is gone and we need to break the swarm kings weakness to deal significant dmg makes the figth impossible for me. I have been stuck on it ever since it was released and i couldn't unlock my Dr. Ratio traces and now i can't unlock Acheron traces either. I really don't know what to do,Negative
"I came back during 2.0 after leaving in like 1.4 and im enjoying it alot more but the only thing for me is I wish during battles you could eat food (to heal your self) and doing that would open up so many more team comps that would work better but instead I have to use an abundance character, when I could us a harmony character( normaly buffs damage) or a nihility character (normally debuffs enemys) that's just my hot take but other than that the game is pretty funüëç",Positive
"Couldn't get the game to work. Downloaded on my phone then it stayed stuck on the train flying in space for a half hour (no that's not an exaggeration it's literal) This is after download and update it just kept loading. I tried closing and reopening, uninstall and reinstall. I wouldn't say this I'd a review of the game cause i didn't play it! But the app needs reworking.",Negative
"idk what to say about this game. gave only 3 stars cuz the only problem was when I click ""start game"" the train moves and it turns black screen, but the music is still going. it is not my phone bc I have 16 GB ram (the other 8 is virtual) and is bought a few weeks ago.",Negative
"Currently Hard for new player, no new player bonus to catch up , no buffs for new players so they can progress the story easier , can't skip story , sometimes the text can't be tap to the next text needs to wait for the voice to made to the end of the text , bad rasio always need to reach 80 pulls and the chances of u losing is higher , new player doesn't need old generation characters because they need alot of Resources to build and they dont have that Currently , not recommend to play for new",Negative
"The storyline and so many easter eggs are the best features of the game. Free to play is not a problem at all to enjoy these features. I paid a bit to show respect to the developers, but my cousin has no issues with free to play since Genshin is her main. Don't believe in my or anyone's words. Just try it yourself and you will see if this fantastic masterpiece of space comedy is for you, the explorer of this whole new universe in Honkai's multiverse, or as the developers call it, the hoyoverse.",Positive
"Absolutely recommending this to everyone. This game is so rewarding it makes you want to play it more (I came over from Genshin, lol). Great events, world, characters, story - you name it. HSR developers doing everything the right way, keeping us hooked! Free 5-star character, plentiful anniversary rewards, beautiful husbands.. I'll be a Boothill main soon.",Positive
This game is actually fun and it's really easy to grind since there's an auto battle option it's easy to be productive and do other things while grinding for artifacts or materials... and there's plenty rewards too it's a suitable game when you too much time on your hands,Positive
"Idk if it's just my phone, but when I go outside of the game (for example opening another app for a second) and opening back the game, my notification shade becomes solid and it doesn't want to go away. It blocks the top of my screen while playing and it bugs me because I need to restart the game for it to go away...",Positive
"Rating two because gacha wise this is one of the most soul crushing experiences I've had. A F2p nightmare. I want to cry. Cut scenes progressing through the game or while ""grinding"" for gems are un-skippable making it take an ungodly amount of time to save up for one multi(at least 4-5 hours if hyper focused), then the rates are so bad I've done at least over a hundred pulls maybe more only one 5 star and still no banner unit. Needs faster way to progress or better rates.",Negative
"Honestly, this game is awesome and I really enjoyed it but the problem is that this game is a whole problem to my phone like my storage is full, also lags REALLY bad! But every time I play honkai star rail, my characters and maps glitches but that's not a problem.",Negative
"I have only 64GB ROM storage but I can still played it even if it's a bit laggy my device can handle with high graphics settings this game is unique unlike some other games even it's only 10GB resources it's already too lag but is not even it had 20+GB,it's really a fun game I rather reset my device just to play this I love this game , at the first time I played I still don't understand it but until I progress a little further it's worth, it I highly recommend this game it's not a waste of data",Positive
"I'm bored of genshin male character design. I want to see more buff hadongkers man. But genshin could not give me. Then I see honkai impact 3rd. I really like the art style and design for all the character. But disappointed when there's not much male playable character. But... NOW!!! HONKAI STAR RAIL YAHOOO!!! Not only they gave us cool, handsome buff men, but now I'm starting to question my sexuality when looking at the woman in the game. Thank you Hoyoverseüëç",Positive
"As a Honkai Impact 3rd player, this game does not disappoint. Follows the same aesthetic, and even the fact that Welt is there and it's exactly the same is funny. Every other character being the same too (with just some differences) makes it really familiar for someone that has played the previous Honkai. On the other hand, I think this is the best TB game I've ever played. It is so well done I wanna cry from happiness. I have nothing bad to say about this game. I would rate it 10000 stars.",Positive
the jump in material and experience costs from lvl 70 to 80 makes it to where all I am doing is waiting to auto battle for extremely low drop rates. I guess in my spare time I could watch videos on what gear to pick 7 months from now when I have the main team leveled up and their light cones. Oh wait I can't because they will release another champ that I will need and I'll also have to farm said champs mats. New players are basically doomed to forever be too far behind,Negative
"This game isn't worth your time. Its power creep is following the same trail that final fantasy brave exvius did but even at a faster pace. Avoid, just play Genshin or Wuthering waves.",Negative
"Best graphic, best gameplay, amazing story, and that's all I need to say. The fact they're giving a free 5 star makes it a 6 star rated game. Keep it up, and please make more of your super fun and entertaining events.",Positive
Main reason because there is no guest accounts you making people to create bunch of useless email addresses only if they want reroll the game and start fresh...come on...bring the guest accounts back.,Negative
"It takes up 20+ GB, and they don't even allow us to delete past quest resources... But it still a great game, just be sure to play it in a device that has 100gb+ storage...",Positive
"Edited: It can definitely be frustrating when summoning new units requires a lot of resources, especially for free-to-play players. Game developers should often balance the need for revenue with providing enjoyable experiences for all players. Offering occasional free summons or events can help alleviate some of the pressure for free-to-play players.",Negative
Game is good but let me skip the dialogues and cut scenes. I will watch if I want or dont if I don't. Don't force it upon me.,Negative
I'm used to be a huge genshin impact fan (and now huge Wuthering Wave fan) but also love tons of games and genres and let me say this is very f2p friendly and extremely fun to play!! So SO happy I got this pre-installed before launch thanks to Moist Critical and other youtubers sponsoring HSR. Keep up the amazing content ‚ù§Ô∏è,Positive
"This game has really surprised me, whether you are playing on PC, mobile or console this game has no experience that feels compromised to make work on your preferred platform. The story is good and the monetization is unobtrusive, you only spend money because you want to the game doesn't make you feel like you need to *at character level 70 for reference*",Positive
"Why the cutscene always lagging on my device i use mediatek 1080 , even i low my framerate it still lagging and crash ..hope u fix it .. i wanna to enjoy watching the cutscene to u know",Negative
I really love the game and the characters (especially bladeüòª) but im sad that its not out on ps4 ...i would really appreciate if it would release on ps4 but i still love the game üíû,Positive
"While I was doing simulated universe, the game froze and when I tried to restore the app it wouldn't let me in the game and just be a black screen.",Positive
"It's an very amazing game especially the enemies and characters, and the amount of rewards we get is even more amazing (genshin could never) , so far I love this game. I have been playing this game ever since it dropped out and the game has not disappointed me even once! Overall amazing game.",Positive
The geme is great and I would personally recommend it to my friends but for me the size of the game is the problem could you add an option in the settings that could delete the files of the completed quest,Positive
"The sticker collection it's a good exploration idea I hope you add more like that in each places in the game, btw I didn't reach to play it yet but I love that kind of exploration type . Like adding sticker to the book and fill it all .",Positive
"I am shocked on how good the game is despite being a gacha game, this game feels like a fully fledge game at times especially on the latest update. the story and the gameplay managed to hook me up and make me forgot that this is a gacha game and Its a pleasant surprise to be this generous for a gacha game",Positive
Look I love y'all's content and games they're really amazing and fun...but seriously the lack of POC characters in not only this game but Genshin as well just upsets me. I'm willing to edit my review but not until I see change on the dev's part.,Negative
The best game ever !!! I can totally say it's a lot better than wuthering waves !!! Just saying though since people think wuthering waves is better well .... That's not true at all !!,Positive
"Super great game! However there's this one weird issue... My game keeps reloading, and it looks like my ping suddenly crashes down even though my internet connection is fine. And what's even weirder is that it's only on the American server. I'd appreciate greatly if this could be fixed, because it affects whenever I travel (enemies can ambush me freely), during quests (it makes the quest dialogue reload from the start), and overall anything else outside of battle.",Negative
"The story of the game is interesting, lots of different characters and events from the launch date till now ..... but when you done with all that and waiting for new content, the gaming experience takes a nose dive, you might only spend between 5 minutes everyday or maybe try again in a weeks time....The problem ""Trailblazer Power replenish time"" 24 hours =240, with this you can't do much unfortunately .... if you don't mind this problematic issue,try it you'll see",Negative
"The graphics, the art, the animation, the storyline everything is so good. It's so engaging and also feeds us with greater characters with every update. Love this one!",Positive
"HSR is a game that has a really good story, character design, and even casting direction held back by an engine that doesn't give nearly enough expression as it's most skilled voice actors and enemy designs that range from baffling to outright cheating. I want to enjoy the game but just when I get truly immersed I get pulled back out by poorly designed combat and balancing clearly done by someone who has EVERY character and forgot this was a Gacha game that won't allocate you those resources.",Negative
"Having played for more than an year now, I can say that Hoyo have been managing this game quite well. It's fun, it doesn't take up a lot lf your daily time and more importantly it has been extremely generous for a gacha (which IS the man reason you are playing right?)",Positive
Once i dowloaded this app.. i played it luterally every day and even frogot to study. It was a life changer. And i gotta admit that i even became obsessed with this game (HSR addiction). It might not be an open world game like genshin impact but this is still a VERY good game. The character designs and stories are very creative. I like the lore alot too. But i literally fell in love with the xhinzhou characters like jing yuan. I became a Blade and jing yuan obsessed person ‚ú®,Positive
New content always has hours of UNSKIPPABLE monotonous dialog. A skip button in a phone game is not too much to ask for in 2024.,Negative
"For the new map in penacony, it seems to have a strong bug where my game glitches and it logs me out, and some buildings are glitching too, but when i teleport to other places it seems just fine, please do something about it...it annoys me, its giving me a hard time doing my story quest, thankyou",Negative
It's a good game but something bothers me well I don't really know it but it is a butiful game animation and the graphics I like it keep it up,Positive
"combat is surprisingly complex for a game where your characters only have 2 moves. story is corny but fun. graphics are stunning, and each area and character looks so cool. music is a little forgettable.",Positive
its so good but it takes up SO much of your storage. the updates are so greedy for so much space every update youre better off not playing it on mobile,Negative
"Playing Honaki Star Rail is like herding cats in space. You think you're in control, but then the game throws you a curveball, and suddenly you're chasing space chickens in zero gravity. The characters are a mix of endearing and exasperating, like that friend who always insists on pineapple pizza. The stunning graphics almost make you forget you're utterly lost in a labyrinthine storyline that would baffle even a minotaur. 10/10 would get lost in space again!!",Positive
"More than 40 characters and barely any of them are people of color, whitewashing characters who were supposed to be people of color too is very disappointing, do better",Negative
I dont know why it keep freezing even though i just change into a new phone and the freezing is always on the battle and the same move. It never happens on my old phone before and i believe its not because of my new phone because i play geshin too and it never freeze like this. The freezing make my phone lagging. This is sucks. And it keeps stop responding.,Negative
"fix your game, after downloading files it still requires me to download it again and again and again till it reaches 40gigabites+ but overall its a great game",Negative
Simple yet addictive turn based gameplay. So many core gameplay related contents and mini games. Predictable gacha.,Positive
"It's an alright game with beautiful graphics, but it's boring. The tutorial is unskippable, and the same with the cut scenes, I almost fell asleep, yup, that's just how boring it is. The graphics and voice acting is worth the surreal amount of space, but the gameplay isn't. It was nice knowing the game, now it's time to part our ways. Here's a 3‚òÜ from me because I don't like judging potentially great games like these too harshly. Uninstalled.",Negative
1. How to make people return to the game: -Bring back Silverwolf Lightcone Quest to obtain that lc -Make food buffs necessary for defeating stronger enemies that can only be defeated using food buffs and they'll drop 1 purple traces -Make map exploring fun and adventurous by adding a Hide and seek multiplayer event similar to the one tower of fantasy have -Make a permanent co-op event where 4 players can only choose one character to use to defeat the boss which drops fuel -Make more PvP events s,Positive
"Im done playin this sit, 280 pull and only got e0 Firefly with no lc, i was really excited for her. Now i lost interest to play this game anymore. Thanks hsr for the memories. Time to enjoy playing wuwa üò∂ü§ô",Negative
Drop rates are trash. I absolutely love the game but the further along you get the worse the odds get. I just spent 75 bucks trying to get The main hero for the limited time event on top of God knows how many other pulls and not once that I get her to drop. How much money do they expect you to pump into this game just to get one friggin character?!,Negative
its nice until you get to endgame and realise you can't actually do any content unless you pull multiple copies of characters and/or their light cones. which takes money,Negative
"This game was fun at first. You got to battle and advance your characters but then you go to the underground world and everything goes down hill. Cut scenes are never ending, battles are short, and the story is stupid. Every quest is meaningless and the plot barely advances. I understand a slower game but with all of the cut scenes it just a boring movie.",Negative
"So far, so good! You take a dip in this game, and it will swalllow you whole. It's like FF with GI appeal. Looking forward to future updates.",Positive
It is a good game but It takes a lot of time üòÉ any way this to good the story line is perfect and everything is just perfect,Positive
Game freezes during divergent Universe. My the game restarts. I have 12Gb ram phone and I know I have ample enough storage to handle the game,Positive
"The game was great when I played it first when it came out ! I wanted to redownload it after seeing the new character but now it's not letting me into the game after downloading all of the resources necessary, it keeps letting me out and saying that the game has stopped I'm so disappointed",Negative
"Being a completely F2P player is actually viable! I was able to pull black swan, Acheron, and luocha as well as black swans and acherons light cone all while remaining F2P. While I will admit there's a little bit of grinding involved, it is leagues better than chest farming in genshin. Artifact grinding is also easier due to the ability to craft artifacts with specific main stats. Stair rails dev team also isn't afraid of rewarding its player base! Switching from genshin was an easy choice!",Positive
Please do something about the game size make that we can uninstall the past Quest because now the size has become too big for our phone to handle.,Positive
"Star Rail really can't stop to blow my expectations against what I could just wanting from a free-to-play gacha game. And now with the latest ver 2.2, I can certainly say that this game is the best experience I have in gacha game story-telling and gameplay I've ever played. Really looking forward for the bright future of the Astral Express, and I can't stop getting excited and wanting more for another journey.",Positive
"It's a great game, but my only issue is when ever I enter a boss fight my phone always kicks me out of the game.",Positive
"Recent ""pvp"" event was just a slot machine you had to do over and over and if you got unlucky it both felt bad and took longer. Genuinely awful execution all around",Negative
"Terrible update. It slows to a crawl and even freezes randomly on character animations in certain battle stages. Once it even made my phone completely unresponsive. Still playable, until it's not.",Negative
"I have played alot of games more recently got into gacha games. Ive played genshin,Lord of heroes and of course honkai. Honkai has been hands down one of the best mobile games i have played and still play. Were coming up on the one year anniversary! To start out there is alot of dialogue in the beginning. A couple people told me they stopped playing because there was so much dialogue in the beginning. Once you get past it the game opens up and you get to experience what the game has to offer",Positive
"This game is really good definitely one of my favourites made by mihoyo I like the gameplay and the character designs as well as the soundtrack, there is so many different events as well and story which is really cool :) (been addicted to it for a while now lol)",Positive
"If your looking for the best turn based traditional jrpg this game is 100% what you are looking for. It has an amazing story, Interesting characters, tons of free in game currency to earn, weeklies and dailies that don't take so long it's a chore, but gives you a way to regularly earn in game currency to summon. The weapon banner is a major upgrade compared to Genshin Impact that makes the weapon banner worth summoning on. If you are looking for the best JRPG game of the last 5 years this is it.",Positive
"Even though this game is made by Hoyoverse, somehow it's actually really good. The characters are amazing, the story is amazing, and overall the gameplay is actually really fun. On top of that the developers are not stingy for hoyoverse standards and I actually feel respected as a player surprisingly.",Positive
"Pretty good pretty addicting honestly better than their previous game more generous the story is a bit weird for me but in a good way and the thing i love most about this game is its humour. I really find myself laughing at some moments and getting those cool references to other media and memes, the devs really were having fun when making this game",Positive
"The only problem I've had is trying to log in which is a recurring problem I don't know if it's because of my device but it refuses to let me log in with the message ""Too many requests. Try again later"" which I wait days till it lets me log in again only to let me log in for the day but if I log out the same message will pop up again and I will have to wait again days making me miss out on some rewards and other things.",Negative
Awesome game but the optimization of this game is a bit slow so its pretty laggy at times but overall would highly recommend!,Positive
"Super great game, great characters, and story. And very generous, extremely better than genshin impact. Even though they're different types of game and shouldn't be compared, don't believe people it's way better, period.",Positive
"Lore is actually nice. Specifically came here for the men, and pulls are doing fine. Fave part of the game is how generous they are with Stella jades and how kind they are with giving a free 5 star character at their 1st anniversary! Absolutely loving the game, I have been an ar70 for just a few months and have been gaining lots of 5 star characters. Love the fandom, admin, and the game itself. Thankyou hoyo for giving such a wonderful game!! Can't wait for any further updates as well.",Positive
Well early stage I kind resist on playing this . But longer I involve I found out it's fun to play. Thank you developers for create this game to enlighten my spare time.,Positive
"This game FORCES you to like a certain character, to the point where it becomes absolutely insufferable. Being forced to go on a date with her wasn't enough for the devs so the game also forced HUGE parts of the story to be done with THIS ONE character on screen for the vast majority of the time on the new quests. Whoever made this game has an absolutely insane obsession with her and wants to shove it down everybodys throats as well. I'll have to unfortunately uninstall.",Negative
"The game is superb! It is perfect for a mobile game AND has good lore. I love everything about this game. Remember, if you want to beat bosses in the Trailblaze missions.. EAT/USE food buffs. They are SUPER important!",Positive
"Implement a story skip button, my review will be 1 star until then. The fact that we don't have a skip button is really annoying, I want to play the game not waste hours of my time that I don't have because of work just to double tap my screen in order to go a little faster through the story!!",Negative
"One of the best relaxing games to play, to just chill and play, and there's no competition whatsoever. It's a nice breath of fresh air after playing genshin impact. But there is a problem with the game. The map disappears. Like the buildings and all, even when I increase the graphics. The floor, the walls the buildings, the surroundings disappear, like it turned invisible. You can still walk and use characters and interact with objects, you just can't see them, which really interferedwithmygame",Negative
"Love this game. I'm picky when it comes to online games since i rarely use my phone to play but this certainly caught my attention. It's been two months since i started playing, and everything's great so far. My phone is compatible w the game since it works perfectly fine before. But after the recent update, the game keeps crashing. I cannot even stay for 2 minutes after entering the game since it'll crash on its own, ruining my gaming experience.",Negative
"been playing this game for a while, and it's fun! the mechanics and the game itself is great, gacha isn't too bad (for me, at least. can't say the same for others) but i keep having this issue where whenever i enter a battle, mid-way through a battle, if i activate an ultimate (usually natasha's, but it happens to others too) the game freezes. the audio is still there but i can't press any buttons. i've had to reset the game just to get it working again. otherwise, no other issues with the game.",Positive
"It's a very fun to play game!!! I love every single detail of the game, how the story and plot twist went, even to adventuring around the map to finish the mission and get all the chest and rewards!! Even loving it when every update gave you a free 10 pull, isn't that amazingüòçüòçüòç The quality will depends on the user's phone/PC. So maybe some of the time, there will be some parts of the maps that will not load and just a black screen like. But it's still a very fun RPG game to play!!",Positive
"this game was meant to be fun, the lore is amazing, the graphics are unbelievable, and everything seemed to be perfect. Until i played it. I wasn't expecting it to be a turn based game, it would've been perfect if the game mode was controllably managed by a person and an enemy ai while battling to win. Would've been so perfect. Just a review. No hate. Graphics are spectacular though.",Positive
"Listen this game is very well made, do not listen to the reviews saying ""It's too hard"" It's truly not, the combat requires thinking with every step, making the best choice on your turn is ideal. The visuals are amazing most of the time. (Especially in the ultimates) it is not pay to win, it just requires grinding like all Hoyoverse games. If you yearn for a challenge with some good music, as well as a funny main character then this game, is for you.",Positive
"Game has great combat system and the gameplay is pretty stellar. Story is pretty decent but there is no skip feature, sometimes you have to even wait for the character to finish their lines before you can proceed even if you already finished reading the text which makes it a massive waste of time if you wanna finish quickly. The game also has a massive amount of puzzles of varying difficulty levels which can get kinda annoying if you try to play after work/school. 20% is for the chars you paid",Negative
"The game itself has no flaws that I can think of. So, long story short, it's amazing. However, what's not amazing is the punishment of being an android Samsung user. The loading screen is stuck on loop and sometimes the game crashes mid fight or just when I'm switching relics. It's really annoying even after doing the suggested fixes. Why must android users suffer? Please fix in 2.1 update.",Negative
"Hello, I love this game. It's so fun and I really recommend it for players who want to explore a galaxy and witness an awesome story together with the very beautiful designs of the characters. One thing which led for me to put it four Stars is that it would be great to have a button where you can lower your level like genshin impact has! It would help greatly for the players that struggle to beat enemies that are much stronger than them. I would really appreciate it if it comes to the game.",Positive
For a game about traveling planets all the characters have the same skintone??? Where's the fun in that?? At least add blue colored aliens or something yall too scared to add darker toned people üòí,Negative
"Hey friendo! Please create a naked skin for Dr. Ratio! :D Also, would you mind adding a touch feature? Like, you can touch them. The naked model of Dr. Ratio. Oh, could you also add an impregnation feature? For Ratio, and maybe boothill too? ;3 can't wait! I get ùìØùìªùìÆùì™ùì¥ùîÇ when I'm impatient.",Positive
"I have a good experience so far though, when I'm honest I mainly focus on combat and not really the story, it makes fun to play. I also like the element to choose autopilot mode when entering battle, if the team is leveled up etc. clears are easier which is a plus for me. The gacha system is a lot better too, and more rewarding. Talking about rewards after meeting the requirements given to you, it feels better and more rewarding than in other games . I can recommend.",Positive
"Free to play player friendly , the story quest can be too good or too bad sometimes. Not that hard to play if you are a casual gamer. But for end game parts , a little dedication is needed",Positive
"I really like the game and starter characters, but I can't do the exp assignments. The area at the top of my screen doesn't register my taps at all.",Positive
"I've been playing this game since release, and I've genuinely enjoyed every moment of it. I've never really played turn based RPGs before and this was a good start for me. I enjoy the story, the characters and the combat system.",Positive
"I have to say I was neutral in the beginning during belobog and xianzhou arc but ever since penacony, HSR has been my favorite game ever. The storytelling from then on is top-tier, the characters are so good, and i love the gameplay. Excited for more. Thanks!",Positive
"dont know why people complain about this game who force them to play if they said it use a lot of time to finish event. The fact is it do use lot time investment in this game but event dont even come that many you have so many day to finish it and get all reward if u want brainrot event that you can easily get reward by a few minute you probably should uninstall this game ane go for ""mario idle afk"" instead",Positive
"HSR is a good game, and I love it, but when the 2.3 update arrived, my storage was crying. The update size was 13 GB, like, idk. I am also playing Genshin on my phone. Take note Genshin is a 4.3 update, and HSR is 2.3, but HSR takes up a lot of storage space compared to Genshin. It's hard to pick which game I'm going to delete. üò≠üò≠",Positive
"This game is great, I play it all the time and it's still fun. There is so much content and they are constantly making more. You might think since it's a gacha it requires you to pay a lot of money to have fun. I have never spent so much as a penny on this game and I have a few 5 stars and have had a lot of fun. 100% would recommend.",Positive
Honkai: Star Rail is already good enough. The graphic quality and the character animations are awesome. This is game better than Genshin Impact. The tutorials are also helpful. I could suggest bringing co-op into the game so players can experience playing together like in Genshin Impact.,Positive
"there are two types of people when playing an story games, first is those who enjoy the game and the second one is those who just casually want to enjoy the game such as gacha and farming, so it is really annoying when the player are force to listen to the story which it is ""UNSKIPABLE"" so it just get tiring trying to skip the story by pressing the dialog multiple time, I hope in the next patch the developers can follow ""Wuthering Wave"" footstep in including the skip story button",Negative
The gameplay is good but what fuels my anger is the 98% dialogues and 2% battles in every story quests. Can we just get an option to skip long dialogue cutscenes? It's too tiring to keep on just tapping your screen (when on phone)/pressing the spacebar(on pc) Some of it are okay but it's just annoying when it takes too much,Negative
I really love this game but the fact I can't skip dialog is boring and annoying seriously if someone wants to know the lore let them because being forced to sit there I don't even listen I just zone out or fall asleep until they stop talking its annoying just add the skip button and let those who want to listen to the story listen some of us just only like the game play being forced to watch every cutscene is annoying to the point you quit the game,Negative
"This game got so Addicting and i love it! I mostly recommend it for devices with high storage, Barely lags and stuff, but when you first play it, the loading was kinda slow, it took around 5-10 minutes",Positive
Absolutely love it. The combination of great characters and a great story makes for a great game! I just wish there was a way to replay story elements like you were experiencing them for the first time...,Positive
"Story is good enough just some useless scene and the way puzzle ruined some part and the most annoying part is forcing player to finish the story that takes a bunch of hours to finish just to do the event, some of the maxed player is already having a burnout issue and adding this just want me to quit game, not everyone have a whole free 3-4 hours of time daily let the player have easier way of earning reward and the story can continue anytime, this cycle burnout is the only problem in this game.",Negative
It is great but the problem I may have broke the game and found a bug. The bug is that argenti won't show up at stage 3 of the superstar showdown hope you can fix it.,Positive
Star Rail is such an unserious game that pokes fun at itself. The jokes write themselves and uses the most famous memes. The music tracks used are (chef's kiss). What cemented my decision to continue playing is when Wildfire played mid battle. We are going to be trailblazing for years to come.,Positive
"Too much powercreep, you pull a new shiny character today they become useless in a couple of patches, the gearing system is atrocious, enough to make someone leave this game and the endgame content is designed around the new strongest DPSes, the amount of HP enemies are gaining every patch is overwhelming, you either whale to clear all content or you don't. I cannot recommend this game even though it has everything to make it a good game for casuals.",Negative
"I love this game, but Hoyo is disappointing me over and over again with the waifu favoritism. They always purposely buff the female characters either directly or indirectly with relic sets tailored specifically for their female characters. While the male characters are always with kits that have a mechanic that requires support. And guess what, most of the supports/buffers are female characters. It has been a year, but no limited 5 star male harmony character AT ALL. Very disappointed.",Negative
"I love this game and mostly play on my PS5 bc my phone battery is a potato but when I first installed it on my phone on launch day, it was so good! The story keeps you playing, the characters are amazing and the free wishes every update is great. I probably play this game too much lol",Positive
"beautiful graphics and storytelling, the combat system isnt one i see a lot but i ended up enjoying it. would definitely recommend but keep note of the long cutscenes ‚ú∞",Positive
"Amazing graphics, cool outfits, unique story content with humorous, Giving us enough rewards for gacha pulls, Giving Female MC same value as Male unlike other games. Everything is great though I didn't like the combat style & characters movement but still it's quite Satisfactory. The game keeps improving, Thank you Hoyo.",Positive
"I love this game so much but the new dream ticker puzzle is quite annoying cause clockie can literally walk through it but he wont do it, maybe put hints in dream ticker puzzles soon to make it more easier especially for people (like me) that isn't good at puzzles",Positive
It's a pretty good game and a lot of fun but there are too many updates. Almost every week there are new characters and it's really confusing. Also it takes a LOT of storage and sometimes there are missions that are almost impossible to complete.,Negative
Been playing since launch and honestly the only bad thing about this game is the pity system but that comes with every gacha game. I'd recommend it if you enjoy turn based gacha games. It's nice that the game doesn't require you to pay to win anything.,Positive
"I am deeply disappointed with the recent update of the game. The developers have made significant changes to one of the characters, which has negatively impacted my gaming experience. It's disappointing to see them catering to certain segments of their fanbase while disregarding the preferences of others. As a result, this update leaves me feeling frustrated and unsatisfied with the overall direction of the game",Negative
It's a good game but I just wish it was more exploration and combat like genshin. Rather than it being already chosen in the order of attacks and taking turns if that makes sense?,Negative
"As a battle enjoyer player, Sunday arc is a living hell. Too long story and dialogue, it kills my mood to play and grinding. And whoever give Robin a single song for the Ultimate is also deserve a smack from players. Others might find it good in story, but for me is just making me sure to not play it more often.",Negative
Very good game but I made an account which it disappeared when I got a new phone to play on I had the uid so made a new account to find the old one but I couldn't very disappointed but it's a good game. I do enjoy the free things and my newer account is doing well.,Positive
"Sadly there aren't any skins for any characters whatsoever. MoC is done and I have to say it was nice but what's done is done. I will continue for the story, but don't have any hope for any permanent stuff, nor cosmetics or anything if they go down the GI route again. Edit (-4 stars): The nerf of enemies is so damn annoying, we can't even have any fun anymore. The bosses get nerfed one day after release or now even from the very start. You can't even see the boss animations anymore. The worst.",Negative
"Amazing game - this is for gamers who want to game on their phone. Very cool and in-depth RPG with fantastic graphics and original story. I'd rate it even more stars if I could. Well done, devs!",Positive
"The Penacony story was really amazing and well written. The graphic, music, character design and everything was so so good. Keep up the great work üëç",Positive
"I wish Robin can sing 3 different songs like If she sings ""If I can stop one heart from breaking"" She'll boost Break effect of her teammates, and If she sings ""Hope is the thing with Feathers"" she'll boost speed and crit rate of her teammates. I wish we gotta choose from albums which buffs (songs) we want.",Positive
"Despite having enough space, the game kept just kept lagging. I played with the settings, yet it still kept lagging. It's a goof game, but this makes it difficult to enjoy. I feel like they neglect Android users",Negative
"This game is wonderful in every sense of the word, very enjoyable, and the character design is attractive, but unfortunately you will need a good device to be able to enjoy high settings.",Positive
"Gacha game done right. The story is A++ (especially with later story). I just feel like dev care about the game, with ever update you get many quality of life improvements, like they are makeing the game easier to do dailys. The gacha is not a problem I never got the feeling like I need to spend money to get some characters with so many events and ways you can get stellar jades. Every 5 stars has they one gimic that makes them unique then other 5*. Yeah, the game is just fun. Recommended",Positive
It is a really good game my only complaint is that the game does glitch where it freezes up but it happens like 4-7 times a month but other than that I mean it's a like 4.7/5.0.,Positive
"I keep struggling to login for some reason. Keep goin in the cycles of waiting for the train, getting an error message and waiting again. My internet doesn't seems to be the problem since I could easily watch videos on yt and other stuff. This has been happening more than once and I couldn't figure out why.",Negative
Great turnbased game but hate the outfits they make the women wear. There's only two girls that get to wear pants they don't get functional armor and even the little girls don't even get proper leg coverage. One world is covered in ice and these girls are walking around on stick thin legs and one doesn't even get shoes. Someone buy the poor girl some shoes. Lol I can't with all the male gaze costumes. Why does Stelle and March have a random garter on the thigh?,Negative
i love the visuals of the whole game. but one simple thing i want to see is that if we could remove some parts of the game storage wise? i dont think ill last for a year playing this game if it updates every 10 gb per update,Positive
Honestly i love this game but I hate how everything depends on how your characters are built. I just want to enjoy the game instead of trying for the multiple times to defeat one guy and changing/rebuilding my characters.,Negative
Love the game but there's a little problem. I can't hear Robin's voice or audio. It was working just fine but suddenly she became mute and I don't know what caused it. Please fix this bug,Positive
"Honkai Star Rail is a pretty fun game, especially now that Robin have arrived! I'm planning to pull for her, but the loading is juat too long.. So instead, I pulled on Arlecchino's bannerüòÖ And the thing is about Honkai Star Rail, when we're on a fight we litteraly can't dodge just like in Genshinü•π So of course we lose alot of HPüíÄ",Positive
"my progress got reset COMPLETELY. I can't skip the tutorial, intro, absolutely NOTHING.. I tried to switch servers multiple times but I still lost my progress.. I even logged in with the same Gmail account yet nothing worked. Pls fix this glitch mihouyo.. :// otherwise I think I'll stick to other games.",Negative
"I tried supporting the game, even deleted my favorite ones just to download this. Ok, I understand the downloading resources part, waited 2 hours for that. The game restarted and for some reason I can't get in. I tried multiple times in and out but for some reason it just went back to downloading resources. This just made me mad tbh..wasted 2 hours for no reason.",Negative
The game is really fun and I enjoyed every event but when pure fiction came out and release I really had difficult playing because it crushes the game. I really dont know what suppose I had to do.,Positive
"the best game i ever played, it's adventure is great, also you can play in android and windows too! it's synced, but one problem is DLC is too huge!!!",Positive
"Every time I go to Fictitious Wordsmithing, the game freezes whenever I use Herta's ultimate. And when it freezes, it kicks me out every single time. I tried doing it 6 once more, and it froze and exited the game suddenly.",Negative
It's not letting me sign back in I just updated it and it says that there are to many.. like I don't use this email on any other phones or tablets.. so how come it won't let me in it says try again later.. why did it sign me out ? It didn't do this last update some do better. All for 300 stellar jade naaah famm I need more then that if your goin to be doing this to us..,Positive
too much endgame that needs meta characters. too much content. events are getting annoying with the amount of dialogues and unnecessary stuff to do. just add a skip button already.,Negative
"The game is fun, and I enjoy the characters. However the game can become quite expensive, so be careful",Negative
Dear Honkai what is happening I did a ten pull using 1 by 1 and when it reached the tenth one I got nothing no 4 star light cone and no character. Edit: I checked again and the pulls I did did not register into my history.,Positive
"As of today, my favorite Hoyo game. It's not super intense with the farming, and past content is playable. The gacha system is still pretty bad, but you don't feel as much pressure into spending. Overall, I am satisfied.",Positive
"Seriously awesome! The best mobile game I have played. Controls and interaction are super easy. Game progression is comfortable with clean storyline. And graphics is awesome. It is F2P with spending options, but hope one can complete the entire game without spending anything. Combat is turn based and strategic in that, you need to have the right teams and that too, built properly. Best for unwinding and for comfortable playing without stressing over complicated controls, graphics or storyline.",Positive
I love this game but sometimes when I want to play it takes longer time to loding. But is okay this game it was very fun just that thank you üåπ,Positive
"I really like this game, but Im not able to enjoy it as much as I would if it were on PC or console, so I will have to stick with Genshin",Negative
Penacony Features and Story are the best! Keep on improving and I'll probably play this game for years to come!,Positive
"2.2 Review: Performance is much improved on the A53. Actually playable and enjoyable now on mobile. Still, I'm giving it a 3/5 because an exceptional RPG is trapped in the body of a gatchapon. Just let me buy the characters, bro. Price them at 150 bucks a pop if you have to. Just let me buy them.",Negative
"I Love this game just how I also love Genshin. And you can also earned lots of stellar jades which you can pull awesome characters from it. and their combat scene is so cool that you won't get bored on seeing it again and again, and the story is also interesting. Sadly I don't have much storage so I was forced to delete it, but if I can buy a new phone or a PC, I'd definitely be playing this again!!!üòÅ",Positive
"The best game from Hoyoverse. Love the depth, the story, the gameplay, and the characters.",Positive
It could be a good game but every single new content forces you to play the way they want you can't really chose what you wanna do its like a prison,Negative
"I AM A FAN OF TURN BASED GAME THIS GAME IS REALLY GREAT AND COOL AND AWESOME HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUT I AM HAVING A ISSUES OF THE CUTSCENES ITS SO LAGGY I REALLY ENJOY THE STORY BUT IT IS A BUMMER IT GIVES ME LAZY TO CONTINUE TO PLAY BECAUSE OF THE LAGGY CUTSCENES IN THE STORIES I MEAN LITERALLY I HOPE IT GIVES ME BACK MY EXCITING FEELING TO PLAY THIS GAME I WILL GO BACK TO PLAY THIS GAME IF THE CUTSCENES REALLY FIX, WANT TO PLAY OTHER GAMES I HOPE IT FIX AND OPTIMIZED THE CUTSCENES. THANK U",Positive
"Good quality but becomes boring with time, same turn based fights, many text to read and side missions to do with lots of text too. If you like books this one is perfect if you are looking for some reading time instead of gaming. Recently they are just releasing many new characters forcing players to top up gems cuz it's impossible to follow up all of them.",Negative
"Nevermind, I just got it back and have zero complaints regarding game play and pacing, although there are a few bugs here and there but overall you guys get a 9.9/10 from me.. and you really ought to manage game storage, 32 GB for a single game is way too much",Positive
I adore this game. However the lack of diversity regarding skin tones is very disappointing. Not to mention how the few characters who have darker skin are gray. Please make more colored characters and please give their skin some actual warmth. Not to mention how Arlan's skill names come off as incredibly ignorant. I've been told that they do not even align with his story as a character either.,Negative
"It's been fantastic. The story, the gameplay, the rewards - all good. And I've been with this game since launch :) Looking forward to the upcoming patch.",Positive
"I honestly loved the strory and characters, it is very well designed and pretty but i do find that it gets boring over time but i guess that it was designed to be that way. However, i wish they added something for the farming system. I guess it's nice having an auto already inside the stage as you farm for materials but i wish they made an auto loop for everytime and each time the stage ends so you don't have to redo the stage only by clicking the ""one more time button"".",Positive
"Okay, I wanna change some opinions.. 1) I know that grinding system is ""addictive"", BUT I really don't like having too much Light Cones cards, maybe reduce it to get 3 cards THEN get a character from each pull will be nice. 2) I feel like some enemy types are too strong even if their lvl are below us (and I hate the mutated enemies ngl), so could you make them less harder for us plz? 3) recently, the game crash/lag every now and then. PLEASE HEAR ME OUT ü•≤üôèüèªüíñ",Positive
"I love the story and the lore, but I'm mostly in love with the character designs and the graphics. All in all, a fun game and I'd definitely recommend it if you're interested in fantasy RPG games.",Positive
"For a while I've played this game. It is by far my favourite. The story, graphics, gameplay etc is 2nd to none. The ONLY reason I've not given this a full 5 stars, is because there was an update yesterday. It kept crashing. Nothing wrong with my phone as I'm running a Samsung S23. My Internet has no issues what so ever. Tried to reach out on Discord and their own site.....can't do it. Seem to have to create a new account to ticket them, but that would only work if I could access the game.",Positive
"The game was nearly flawless, but I need a little bit of time to adapt because I started playing when the 2.2 update was released and i'm a little bit struggling to catch up with the updates too.",Positive
"They nerfed 2.1 Story Boss to Appropriate Difficulty! Hoyoverse listens to their community :) This game really is great, there is so much content the gameplay is as involved as you want it to be, auto play is great for grinding. So many opportunities to pull for free from in-game gems and regularly scheduled events. Original post: NERF AVENTURINE BOSS THIS FIGHT IS COMPLETE BS FOR NEWER PLAYERS!",Positive
"The Game is great so far, especially when it first release however I returned to my account to play it again but i have encountered a few disconnection or crashes this a lot...I wonder what happened and there is as well one thing i got annoyed of, After I finally logged in, The glitches won't stop. I hope its fix for me D:",Negative
"Love this game. I joined for the turn-based combat and got blown away by the story. There's lots of end-game content, story content, events, and more. The amount of detail that goes into crafting the environments and the little funny interactions you find is incredible. You never feel like any part of the game was made in a rush, or in a lazy manner. Everything the developers do is for one purpose: for you to have as much fun as possible. Thank you hoyoverse!",Positive
Game is ok. Hate the company. They don't care about their users or fan. I want more frames on my android and PC and I want some respect to the Australian region. Never do we ever get offline event or concerts. We barely get the game and I'm tired of being quiet.,Negative
"While the gacha rates are still an issue, the game delivers a fulfilling experience and somewhat better rewards than GI (its predecessor), as well as QoL improvements, breathtaking scenery and music. As a turn-based title, controls are simpler and gameplay is easy to pick up. Also, the new [Penacony] region is impressive, love the many references to classic media and culture in the dreamscapes. Looking forward to future developments, but for now, highly recommendable.",Positive
"Overall, a good game! I have a few problems: laggy cutscenes, missing and glitchy environment/character details, glitchy voices and character movements, the train on the log in screen was missing half its parts and has late music. My other phone can somehow handle it but this new device I'm using to play the game is having these kinds of problems. I wish there would be ways to fix this but as of the moment, I suffered from the constant lack of things to see on screen, it's hard to do puzzles.",Negative
I think of this game and I really like you so much so I really hope they have another update and think if something that is really useful because I love getting like all the characters and I liked all the characters details and I like every character special move.,Positive
"it's an amazing game honestly I loved it! I've spent so many hours playing this game it's so fun but suddenly I don't know what happened when I was with firefly,she was saying something on repeat, my game crashed I kept on trying it again but idk why, it's still crashing till now I don't know how to fix it im literally stuck there so hoyoverse if you can help see what's going on that would be amazing cus I still want to continue!",Positive
I love this game since the first Time I preinstalled and saw the design....absolutely stunny visual and character design!! The character I love most is firefly since she is a cute girl and also a shy one:3,Positive
"Very good story, fun gameplay, awesome battle system, amazing graphics, ton of stuff to do. I mean, I didn't like a game like this for a very long time!",Positive
"I having the big blast playing and enjoying this game. it also fun and not so difficult, lot of character also i like it",Positive
"We need a skip button. People don't have time for boring dialogue, they have to work.",Negative
"This games suck.. totally not fair, I just play for half years and already lost my rate off for 4 time.. in ganshin I'm played for 2 years and just lost rate off twice and in wuwa I never lost rate off.. how this games so evil to me? I'll just delete this games.. spend money for nothing",Negative
"Great game. Although, its storage size is becoming too big for my phone to handle. I hope the game gets a new feature, like in Genshin, where we players could delete previous or already played game files.",Positive
"I took a break from playing because I didn't have any new characters I wanted to build because Im saving for a character. The only reason I have to play this game is the story and the characters, which I do like, but the gameplay doesn't really pull me in until there's something new to do",Positive
"Very enjoyable experience, the gameplay is easy to grasp(atleast for me) and also very fun. I enjoyed penacony story quest, i think the plot until now is amazing and penacony is probably the best map between the 2 other with much more fun puzzles. The problem is that some of the new boss restrict me from progressing due to being so hard like the new adventurine boss which is so unbelievably hard(currently tl39), i just want them to have an option to lower the boss difficulty after like 1 lose.",Positive
Nerf the aventurine boss. The boss playstle itself is good but the damge dealt by the boss is too much. To get a point over 9 with 1 hit is pretty much impossible any support character that don't have aoe atcck will basically die. Stop with the 'Bet' thingy or just give our character like massive buff when winning the 'BET or weakness on the boss. When the character is 'betting' with aventurine I can only see cons to our character and not to aventurine.,Positive
Been playing this game for the past few days and it's amazing. I don't really like turn base combat but this game makes it really fun in my opinion. The characters are really good and the story is interesting. It has a lot of pop culture references as well üò≠üò≠üôè great game,Positive
"This game is awsome! I love the charackters and the chances are higher to get them! The main story is intresting and the map is well designed,eventhough i wish the NPC would move around and do NPC stuff.All in all, the game is awsome! Download noooow >:D",Positive
"Turn Based RPG done right. Super fun combat, with an action packed story. And you actually have to use your brains to strategize the matches to win. Highly recommended",Positive
"Literally the best turn based game ive played missions are enjoyable, it doest take long to finish unlike genshin that takes years to finish a single quest, game characters are very nice every single on of them is just superb!!",Positive
"It would be pretty nice if you could have your own room. Other than that, perfect. Also, people say you need to spend money on this. That's false.",Positive
"An ad said I'd get 80 free draws for downloading the game, and only 20 were given. Two weeks later I still see the ad on other games promising 80 free draws, and false advertising. The game might be OK, but the game doesn't give you what it claims it will, why bother with false advertising?",Negative
Love this game. Yeah it's a gacha but compared to the other available from Hoyoverse this one for me feels more rewarding. Less grindy.,Positive
"Perfection if it was a game. I want to personally make out with every employee, manager, etc. That was involved in the making of this game for 30 minutes each",Positive
"1. Takes forever for farming for a character not counting relics 2. Relics system is so bad that you are kinda forever stuck if you are unlucky 3. Too hard content, the end game content is specifically tailored new released character and 1 new character is released ever 20 days. You can't get all characters without paying even if you pay and get you don't have resources to build them.",Negative
"Gameplay is fun, and the inclusion of an auto mode makes the material farming easy. Music is top tier in my opinion, and the story is good.",Positive
"The one to beat. Hoyoverse quality, a team that cares, generous rewards, excellent characters, a phenomenal story. This is the gold standard of gacha gaming, and good luck trying to dethrone it.",Positive
"Played since day 1, and it's nearly been a year. Overall an enjoyable game with great story, however some mechanics such as repeatedly completing stages to farm for equipment and character leveling materials can become frustrating at times. Despite that, the game still has many other content to enjoy, along with unique bi-weekly events that provide plenty of rewards for character summons. Looking forward to what this game will bring in the future!",Positive
premium currency and summon tickets/cards are a pain to get and the story is kinda generic but otherwise ok at best.,Negative
"Redo-ing my reviews, Dev is quick to answer issues here, which is fabulous. HSR is one of the games I enjoyed. You can use free units to carry you. I've been playing nonstop with refreshing turn base combat, cute story, and the best thing for me is that their main protagonist doesn't become underpowered or obsolete. I would recommend anyone who likes a modernised turn base style combat. üòä Note: if you're having crash issues or resources won't download, I fixed this by lowering graphic to low.",Positive
"I wish we could play with friends in the same map. And to add the feature of deleting previous quests data to save space. Other than that, it's perfect.!",Positive
"It's way too much. Usually I love story and lore, but it's so much that it starts to not work -or make any sense. I can't stand sitting there reading paragraph after paragraph when I just want to play the game. Not to mention the various different UI's that don't make sense. I also dislike turn-based combat. It kind of works for this game, but everything else ruins it.",Negative
"I love this game, I hope you're going to make a wishlist return for all players who missed all the special characters. Anyways, thank you for a wonderful game. However, the event that's supposed to be there isn't there. What is going on? I haven't done anything yet to get Penacony already. I hope I do get in. Add newer critter creatures batch please",Positive
"First of all, I can't beat the boss quest, second of all I don't see the system to decrease the equilibrium level, I've been beating like twenty times and I'm still being defeated, totally waste of my time, please fix it the system to decrease to lower in next version. I'm gonna stuck in my quest.",Negative
The story and the characters are amazing. Even the gacha and quest systems feel more polished and more rewarding than other games. I had just one problem: Some of the battles are really difficult and it sometimes feels like the game locks new progress behind meta characters which you have to pull for. Which was not a problem when the game was released but now it is because more and more characters are being added. The game needs a world level lowering mechanic!!!,Positive
I believe there should be darker playable characters that aren't a shade of ash. Do better.,Negative
Instantly like game the moment I started it and then I saw Kafkaü´†. It's a pretty good turn based gacha game. Music here is such a vibe too. Story is good,Positive
"The best hoyo game out there, graphics, story, music, characters just literally EVERYTHING. Plus the fact that they listen to their players and show how much they appreicate us (HSR is very generous compared to their other games) levels it up x100%. Thank you for this gem!",Positive
"The simulated universe is so unbalanced. The one with erudition and with the annoying bugs. The recommended level is 80, but the enemy is beyond level 80, and their hp is so high.",Positive
"The game is good, but the Svarog boss fight is stressful for me and he is too strong, I can't even beat him",Negative
"It's a very great game. Great sound design, graphics, animations, well designed character etc. I am giving 4 stars because I want a option called ""skip"". Instead of autobattle there should be an option to skip battle. Maybe the players can gain tickets to skip battle through various events and battles etc.",Positive
"First off, literally can't update the game because it's too much space and my storage can't handle it, so I can't play it anymore üò≠üò≠ However, if you do have enough space, DOWNLOAD IT. Trust me, this game is amazing, story, graphics, characters, battle system, all of it is top notch, and you can play it f2p too! If only it wasn't 33+ GB üòî",Negative
"Sometimes, when I use Asta to attack enemies (ehen starting the battle), the game crashes during the loading where it says ""Weakness"". When I restart the game, the issue doesn't happen again.",Positive
"It's a standard Mihoyo game: a cash grab for charas & lots of grinding to get RNG-based items to make them viable. It IS gorgeous to look at, & has very deep lore--sometimes TOO much, really. The story is whatever, not awful but isn't anything groundbreaking. The English voice acting is overall VERY good with a few notable ear-grating exceptions (March in particular, urgh). **DON'T buy the daily gems thing--it's a ripoff, there have been several skipped days, even though I signed in daily.**",Negative
"Cool and polished game, wish there were more free materials for grinding. Otherwise story and choises seem very impactful and make a real difference from time to time for story progression.",Positive
I love the game because of many reasons. Game is full of exploration and adventure. Art style is top-notch. The story is amazing. Gameplay is easy and simple. High quality audio and beautiful graphics.,Positive
"One of the most fun games I've ever played. Amazing story telling/game mechanics/animations, devs that listen, constant quality of life improvement, and generous rewards. Debatebly hoyoverses best game so far!",Positive
"This game is exactly what I dreaming to play,the character designs and concepts are amazing and great.The visuals and cutscenes are spectacular and the whole story was both tragic,Fun,Sad but enticipating.",Positive
"Erm the ad lied I didn't get 80 free pulls ü§ì‚òù all jokes aside it's fun. But I don't understand it on phone, for me it works great and I love the characters designs. I would give it 5.. But the map confused me",Positive
"I really like the new update but sometimes when playing it just crashes my phone isn't even overheating or anything, sometimes when battling, the character attack first or the animation plays first instead of the splash art character appear when tapping ult. Pls fix hoyo.",Negative
Penacony Exploration and gameplay was fantastic but Storyline is like written by attention seeker Character date or do fun stuff with MC then kill this character classic clich√© scene predictable. I played this game since launch when Tingyun turned out to be Phantelia it was written much better but killing Firefly is worst move on HSR in addition i was looking forward to Black Swan and Sparkle but i am seriously disappointed by last move(trailblaze mission). Edit 2.1 came,Positive
A great game for those who are bored and are looking for characters to gush over. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that there are some optimizations like faster ways to clear Simulated universe being none existent even with the introduction of a certain nihility ranger. Over all it's a really good game.,Positive
my gaming was been ok since the release of the new patch but the game just keep crashing down in my laptop ( as of now) and it's not even loading anymore. üò¢ it's just stuck with black am I the only one experiencing these? my laptop is fine like it doesn't have any problem loading other apps.,Negative
The game is good and the characters are amazing but when I tried to open the game it always crashes please fix this the graph ics needs some improvements some structures won't load and some times the floor won't even load it's really annoying,Negative
"The problems I had before is actually fixed (in some way or another?) In this 2.2 there's no freeze/crash problem whatsoever while playing Honkai: Star Rail. I've fun time on this game, can't wait for the next update.",Positive
"After hitting pity at 90 pulls on a character banner I was given a non-advertised character instead. Apparently, if you read 5 pages of fine print then this kind of bait and switch is intentional, but it still makes for such an unbelievably awful consumer experience. You pay with your time and money for X content but instead you are given unusable garbage that wasn't even advertised. It honestly makes me want to uninstall the game or at the very least never spend money on the game again.",Negative
"Game is good, no bugs everything works smoothly, nice sound tracks, awesome graphics. Just want to say that this game do consumes a lots of storage space. For me I can see the size is 19 GB üòë.",Positive
In my opinion (no offence) hsr and genshin are both good games but hsr is just better in many categories like the rewards here are just simply better than genshin is but between the optimization genshin is better since it can run smoothly on my phone that has a snapdragon 732g I know that it's not that powerful but I do wish that hsr can have a bit more optimization so that more people with low to mid end devices can play this wonderful game it's all I've got to say thank you for reading this.,Positive
"I tried this game on a whim and was blown away from the quality of gameplay, there's a lot to do for a free game but I'm sure personal experience varies on its character drop so be warned this is a gacha, you can still get by if you know what you're doing or pull wisely. Great game overall.",Positive
"VERY GENEROUS WITH REWARDS FOR NEWCOMERS, PEOPLE RETURNING AFTER ABOUT A MONTH, AND DURING ANNIVERSARIES AND EVENTS!!! otherwise kinda mid... Except characters and gameplay, very cool and interesting!! Pretty girls, handsome guys, it is turn based tho BUT it's still very fun and I totally recommend it!!!!! (I was the first to review btw I just wanted to actually say something about the game)",Positive
"Honkai Starrail is SUCH A GOOD GAME!! Genuinely story wise, character design, map design, and even world building! This game is so genuinely amazing it's jaw dropping like actually- HSR is also F2P friendlyn so if you have no money but still wanna play a good quality anime game this is one of them!!!!!",Positive
"Incredible game. Absolutely love the gameplay, story, design, characters, all really good. Very F2P friendly. You don't need to spend anything to have fun in this.",Positive
"Okay, so my issue is that I had played last night and it was fine. Then this morning I played again, it was fine. Until I got to school. When I turned my phone back on it had took me back to the loading screen and told me I needed to redownload the data. Which is stupid because I waited a few hours for it to download days ago. I'm redownloading it but if my issue isn't fixed this is staying a 1 star.",Negative
"I love the game but when i like log in and everything, it has to download recourses but when it takes really long and it will either stay stuck on a percentage for really long, or it will just say for me to clean up my storage, even though my storage is almost totally empty.",Positive
I love turn-based RPG so much. Hoyoverse somehow manage to sell combat system that some gamers think it's old by flexing its simplicity. Very F2P friendly if you actually BUILD your character and only care about the main content. (Endgame content? Too many and it's ever-expanding.),Positive
"The gacha is clean. Animations are top notch. Dialogues are hilarious. Memes plenty. Lots of optional gameplay. Turn based mechanics is beautifully executed. Amd the rewards are simply amazing. Imo, much better than genshin. Absolutely bonkers of a game. Love it. 10/10,would recommend.",Positive
Played at launch but dropped it after a couple of days. Biggest mistake I made. Decided to give it a go again when 1.2 dropped and finished Jarilo VI. Was completely hooked until now and it just keeps getting better. Amazing game 10/10,Positive
Everything is good and summoning are pretty much same.. But I would be very happy if I can skip tutorial whenever I make a new account. I need to do the dm tutorial again üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ please put skip button. I'd care about other just tutorial please....,Positive
I love the game but when I got to a certain level the screen got stuff on a certain item which didn't go away and now every time I love the game I only get a black screen that doesn't load at all.,Negative
"It was all good until I downloaded the other one. When I downloaded it, it automatically stopped downloading. When I tried to enter the app, it just shows black screen and kicks me out of the game.",Negative
System combat and skill really unique and characters from previous game return back. Im really hyped for old honkai characters.. Hope we will get better rewards and chapters story for next version ...So far my luck here very good whithout spending any money.,Positive
Easily addictive and fun to play.. only downside is the chances of getting limited characters 90 draws with a 50% change to get is a bit too much... at least make it 100% chance at 90 draws,Positive
Dear Hoyoverse... First of all i thank u for making a good game like honkai star rail... Everything is good but there's a problem and i would be happy if someone can help me with... The thing is... I play the game on my mobile... (Huawei nova 5t)...and its not weak device... I have good internet connection... And everything is great but... Whenever i try to login into the game while im using wifi the game can't login and instead show me error 1001-1.. I hope someone to help me soon.,Negative
Its a very fun game that runs smoothly but lately i have been getting dom troubles of logging in it will crash once or twice after it loads Also dan heng is invisible for some reason hes invisible whene hes fighting whene hes using his skill and whene hes in the team building menu and its very annoying to me honestly so please fix it in the next patch?,Negative
"Bad customer support, locking your game for no reason, i change device and ""too many requests"" and i cant log in for days. Their support team is non existent. This game is good but have a bad support team.game is glichy,takes too much space. They are focused on big details but cant fix minor details like lagginess and bug fixes!",Negative
It's great And all but I destroyed my account and the enemies are too powerful so add a revert world please I really need it and it was good to play but I can't really process with the story with the strong enemies ao and revert world level plss,Positive
"Good game, has never crashed on me, good quality story with interesting characters, doesn't take up too much space for how intricate the world is, gacha rates are pretty nice since there is a soft pity and I have 4 limited 5 stars as a f2p player in only one month of play. Story is good too, and updates are pretty frequent.",Positive
"Dunno what's with the dip in reviews. Star Rail is one of my favorite games. It has a superb story and it's characters are unique and powerful. Four stars aren't much behind five stars. Only exception is Acheron, who is incredibly overpowered. I do recommend this game.",Positive
"Very good style, gameplay and rewards No lag and good performance (in this device) I should get a better phone in order to keep playing this game Looking forward for future banners/characters/light cones I like this turn based game and the time for each banner to get released",Positive
The fact that you can't turn off the battle animation is very tiresome. Having to see the same combat animation very fast again and again with a very loud SFX and music that makes my head hurt. The game keeps crashing even with the updates it's annoying.,Negative
I play on my PC but when I tried downloading it on my phone everything was working until I had to do a verification code and Everytime I went off the app then come back on to put in the code then click check it would say please get a verification code and I would do it over again. Please fix this,Positive
Really loved this game so far. The story is pretty good and the characters are interesting. The combat is turn based but with a little twist. It's also completely possible to be free to play and have a good time.,Positive
"It's an interesting game but it's seriously buggy with missing parts like walls and such, I like the characters but it's all ruined by the glitches all over the place.",Negative
I like almost everything else about the game. I would like more purchase options and package deals but im sure it will only get better! GREAT WORK! It comtinues to get better and better!,Positive
Excellent game! Smooth gameplay and many interesting events. F2p friendly game as well and the devs hear our complaints in every QoL. Highly recommend for those who like turn based game and thise who didn't enjoy co-op mode.,Positive
"My fav game, but tbh, the game should have a free characters, you should also make the bosses a little weaker, like, ofc some characters would die when 2 rounds, everyone's weak, and then the boss would kill you, and I feel like they need to have a love story, like Dan Heng and the girl with the stellaron, and don't get me started with Himeko, she should NOT be trial like she just leaves the team, she's so capable of STRENGTH She was my strongest, and please make Jingliu a free character",Positive
Game plays well on my Samsung S23. No lag or stutters. I really love the turn based combat but especially the fun events they keep coming out with. The most fun one was the Pokemon inspired Aetherium Wars event. EDIT: 1st anniversary rewards are AMAZING,Positive
"At first I thought the game was very boring. But I realized I was wrong. This game is really fun!! Believe me, you will not feel fun if you only watch her videos. The experience is completely different! I love how this game gives so many prizes. I hope they continue like this without disappointing me and the community .",Positive
"my fav game for droid, girls are cute and interesting, huohuo and topaz are my favorite, herta being cool aswell with her doll aesthetics, devs arent too greedy, you can pay $5 a month and get 19 extra pulls for logging in, you could farm 3-4X that just by playing normally possibly 5-6X if you grind, the extra $5 is only a little extra bonus, story and atmosphere is very good, i also like how the character names and style is chinese, good change from the usual japanese stuff im used to.",Positive
"Gameplay, characters, story all are 10/10. But, there is frequently a problem when logging in -> ERROR_CODE_0001 something. Pls look into it.",Positive
It's a very good game and it's f2p friendly but the main issue is that it's a but too big in size for Android devices it's only benn 1 year but it went from 7GB to 19GB My phone is not very happy with it even genshin impact a open world game that is been out for like 4 yrs is 17GB If the creators are reading this comment please do something about the size of this game I don't want to quit this game but at this rate I think I might,Positive
"Love the gameplay (sort of), characters, the VAs, and the world building (i read the newspapers around the area). My only gripes with this game is the relic grinding. To whatever god that can answer my plea, PLEASE JUST GIVE ME CRIT RATE I DON'T NEED DEFENSE ON MY BLADE",Positive
"I love this game so much! The lore is interesting and detailed and the gameplay is amazing! At first I didn't like it because I was a genshin player, but now I got used to it and it's so enjoyable. The rewards are really good and ingame mechanisms are so fun! Overall this game is amazing, I'm looking forward to future updates.",Positive
"The game keeps crashing in the starting screen. I've already tried to reinstall it, I've also changed the display mode from compatible to normal but nothing changed. It's still crashes.",Negative
Worst gaccer game I lose my 50 50 total did 140 pull I didn't get the 5 star until yeat that never happened on honkai star rail this the first time that happened I always get my character on 120 pull if I lose 50 50,Negative
"This game is beautiful. It is well written. It is well designed. The gameplay is a delight and there is plenty of content. It is also a gacha game. It's ""unfair"" to compare it to Genshin Impact in that the differences between the two and the impact they have on the relative playability of each of them show with absolute precision why monetization is so absolutely and totally opposed to playability. Play Star Rail. There's Way Less Gacha In It Than Genshin Impact‚Ñ¢ üëç",Positive
Fun gameplay? Yes. Technology? Yes. Good characterization? Yes. Rich story? Yes. Epic quests? Yes. Good music? Yes. Freedom of choice? Yes. Anything else? Yes.,Positive
"Hsr is an amazing turn based game with many interesting characters and amazing story. But after the recent update, my screen has been freezing everytime I play. I tried exiting the game and clearing my memory but it doesn't work. Please fix this Edit: the issue was fixed and now it's become one of my favorite games.",Positive
"Now i might sound like a bot or those mobile game ads, but the team behind this one are GENEROUS. ‚Ä¢Gameplay is easy to grasp and it's also fun ‚Ä¢The storyline is a very solid 8/10 ‚Ä¢The events are simple and easy to understand with good time limits ‚Ä¢The QoL features just keep getting BETTER ‚Ä¢Very funny references to current real life culture And just more. This is truly peak gacha game enjoyment. Edit: The recent storyline is AMAZING. 9/10 This time",Positive
"This game has made me homosexual, the male characters are too good looking. Because of this now I can't stop dreaming of Blade and Boothill at night. You should make the characters less hot. And also we need tied up Boothill. Other than that the game is pretty funü•∞",Positive
This game is great. It has a funny sad and happy storyline üôÇ. My favorite character is march 7th,Positive
"Love this game everything it offers, the animations. Can say I got addicted to it. But sadly since the last update it hasn't worked anymore. I'm stuck in the lobby and can't press anything, pls help",Positive
"fun, intriguing and full of action, always wanting new characters, the best game I've ever played",Positive
"This is for Gallagher, and also what's with the huge storage space? I've already inuninstall a lot yet still insufficient storage???",Negative
"One of the best games I've ever played, been playing since 1.1 and the game has never looked better. And now at 2.0, just from the music itself im flabbergasted, and the impactful storytelling too, alwayss keeps you on edge. The rewards provided to us players are also superb, and the endless endgame content provides unlimited replayability even after finishing the main story quests. Voice acting 10/10, Music 1000000/10, and designs 20/10. Just please bring back our Firefly:)",Positive
"Great game! The graphics are nice, character designs are pretty decent though I suggest adding more/changing the clothing style in the future (especially female characters), game play is enjoyable, story is decent, rewards are satisfying, relic rolls are... Horrible but I guess it's fine since the trailblaze fuel has given a lot. Overall, it's a really fun game! It may not be suitable for some people's interest in turn based games, but it's a recommend who enjoys it!",Positive
"To be honest, I went into this game thinking it'd be your average fighting game. I did NOT expect to get so attached to the characters, and storyline. The graphics, effects and characters are outstandingly gorgeous, and the story is extremely well done and actually makes sense. It's impressive how they featured the battles, because of that, it's actually fun. Thank you Hoyo for yet another beautifully amazing game üíñüíñ",Positive
"I don't like major updates that keep coming every week, it really drains the storage on my cellphone, especially for those who use a cellular network, the internet also drains a lot.",Negative
Please do something about the updates and resource download I haven't be able to play this game it's been months now for a mobile this game asks for too much data that it is impossible to download resources according to mobile this needs to be fixed. Because of this my mobile starts to hang while opening the game.,Negative
"I'm literally hard locked in the latest Trailblaze Story quest because of my Equilibrium level, the boss is too strong for my level 70 characters, at least give us an option to lower the difficulty when it comes to story quests.",Negative
"Best in-game content and lots of rewards... also superb character design focusing on every small details, attack animation are awesome too...overall truly deserve 5 star...best turn based game I played so far",Positive
"As old player for HSR, I like the endgame content, the story in penacony and our relationship with trailblazers and their friends. The most wonderful part about this game, they tried their best to listen to community, so I cannot simply give compliments. As for feedbacks, please add difficulty change as toggle, even though I able to clear it, but newer player having hard time with that. Secondly, I hope they rerun event that involves event lightcones",Positive
"This is by far, the best turn-based game i've ever played. My kudos to the whole Hoyo-Verse staff team, thank you from the bottom of my heart.",Positive
Amazing animations and story along with great and fun combat. The visuals are spectacular! Another great addition to Hoyoverse games.,Negative
"Hello! This game is really fun and entertaining, the story gets you thrilled and it gives you missions and side quests as well if you haven't reached the required level for the mission. Also, I like the part where you give newbies free 5-stars characters! The only teeny-tiny problem that I have is that this game is turn-based, it does annoy me everytime I enter combat because the enemies replenishes energy itself ‚Äî People would love it more if it weren't turn-based, just an opinion.",Positive
I love this game so much as the game is a turn based rpg and has many unique fighting styles and the quests are fun to do as some of the quests are about the current playable characters! And doing the adventures are fun,Positive
"After one year of playing, this game is by far the best gacha I've ever played. The rewards are great, the story is solid and impactful, and it's balanced perfectly to be fair for f2p players. The devs of this game clearly care and are only getting better with each patch, unlike the first Hoyo game I ever played, Genshin Impact. I went into this game expecting nothing close to what it has given in its first year of release, and can confidently say that it has surpassed it's sister game. 10/10",Positive
I thought it wasnt great at first but then after rejoining it again this year... it is absolutely amazing! The storyline and character design is just perfect,Positive
Its amazing and has amazing fuctions and is relatively easy to understand it's even better that you can access it from any device. Although I haven't used my PC in a while -_-,Positive
"I LOVED THIS GAME, so much and thats comeing from a past genshin player. The character designs are fantastic as well as the world designs. But their is on problem. Its to big. Like its the size of genshin impact but its only on 2.3 or something. If it would be possible could you try and shrink the app like you did with genshin and maybe and the feature to delete past quest. If you can thank you.",Negative
"I like this with all its stories,characters and trashcan lore. The animation is amazing and there are lots of rewards so there is no need to spend money to get any character. The only reason I am giving this a 4* and not a 5* is because after the recent update the game just crashes after playing for few minutes and I have to reopen it which is very annoying. I hope that this issue can be resolved quickly.",Positive
Hey could you please fix the game itself it keeps crashing whenever I am on the tutorial (Kafka main prologue) The game itself still smooth like other says that much but please fix it I don't want crashes again and again its been literally 5 times in a row when I am still trying to finish the tutorial (prologue),Negative
Doesn't tax my smartphone (Oppo 76A). Always note that smartphone can last 3 or 4 years of used if played games only. The game is turn base. Framing for material is slim less. Story line is well written also touch of comedy.,Positive
"I like this game but the complete lack of attempt to make more dark skinned characters is ???, yes they just dropped one at the time I make this review but even then in their other games they execute it so poorly so they just make characters ""tan""(its just blood circulation, they look similar to my white uncle). in Honkai: Star Rail they have two dark skinned characters currently, I doubt any will be added in the near future. Their skin is ashy, Arlan seems MUCH lighter in some of his emojis.",Negative
"This game was awesome,there was great storyline,great characters and the design of the character was just amazing.However sometimes the game would crash when I just logged in the game.",Positive
"It's a really fun and exciting game if you like turn based battles, the cutscenes, story and characters are really well done, highly recommended",Positive
"Mihoyo continues to impress. A fantastic game that boasts exceptional quality across the board, and has become a trend-setter to influence all new and future turn-based (and other) games. The game mainly suffers from horrible cutscene lag that doesn't have an easy (or in my case, any) fix, and increasingly rampant power-creep with each new character - with each new character being as strong or stronger than the last, the new content becomes more challenging (for better and for worse). 9.5/10",Positive
The game was kind of interesting. I enjoyed the simulation thing with choosing buffs after defeating enemies. The turn based combat was good. The animations were fun. But not being able to skip dialogue really killed it for me. When I get a game I want my time to be spent playing the game. Maybe I'll go back and watch cutscenes or read/listen to dialogue. But if the dialogue has meaningless choices there's no reason it can't be skipped and viewed later.,Negative
"Story is enjoyable. Arts and sounds are awesome. Battles are not that strategic since the only thing you can do is basic attack or use skill, and choose when to use the ultimate. Some stages are challenging though, so that's good. Mini games are easy and fun, I like it. Overall, I do enjoy the game, but would like to see more complexity towards the battle gameplay.",Positive
"Starting off with the game, it already gives off a unique experience for the player. It is truly a new experience to behold coupled with the intriguing gameplay. It isn't easy but it wasn't relatively difficult either, so you can definitely enjoy the game with minimal effort (depends). Sadly, there were indeed minor issues such as sudden framedrops and lag often times. Making me experience motion sickness. It also drains my phone's battery life quickly than it normally would (Redmi Note 12).",Positive
"CS ignored my feedback so I'll make it public. Drop rates have become ridiculously low for me in this game both in the gacha and in farming materials. 50/50 is more like 20/80; You spend day after day farming for ""relics"" which often have random chances of rolling good stats. I've spent the last two months and have maybe only 1 relic out of thousands that has nice stats, when each character needs 6... Just about done trying with this game. Incredibly demotivating.",Negative
"It's an amazing turn based game with beautiful graphics, UI and character designs. There is currently one major issue and my reason for giving it a 3 star; technical server side connection issues. You get disconnected from a fight for 1 second? You'll get thrown out of the entire game forced to repeat the entire of what is sometimes a 15 minute battle. It happens way too often along with random client crashes on all less modern devices including PC, Android and even iOS. Fix it.",Negative
"please do fix this bug, hoyo :) my phone kept on going black when a certain scene comes up, i can't get out of the game and my phone won't work whenever it happens unless i restart. i have genshin impact in my phone with a very high quality and it has no problem with it so i'm hoping that i'd also have no problem with starrail. the graphics quality as well, whenever i change it to high or very high, even medium and low, the background goes white. please do fix it.",Negative
"Really fun game, the story is pretty solid, the characters are nice and have a variety in them on appearence, theme and style. It's the fighting system that I really like, eventhough it is a turn based game, and the first of this kind I played, you pick it up easily and the animation is gorgeous and it never feels boring or draged out when you play. The fight system is pretty challenging, but you can learn it in a few turns, the game goes over it nicely in tutorials. Good game!",Positive
"The game is good but it is very resource hungry. I have an above mid-range phone but if the settings are anything above ""lowest"" I lose a lot of FPS. The game has beautiful art and design but it doesn't matter because it is only playable on ""big squares"" mode or else all animations are choppy due to low FPS rate. If you don't have a high-end gaming phone, I don't recommend it.",Negative
"Good character design, nice rewards. But thats all. The story isnt that captivating, battle system is mid, and so is the rng. Besides, the semi open world isnt even that pleasant to explore, since you are highly restricted to certain areas. You cannot jump, climb and you pretty much are forced to do stuff, rather than just randomly enjoy the game.",Negative
"This is a really good game! The graphics are okay(for me as a low end device user, surprisingly) the characters are cool, the 4 stars are actually good, so you don't have to get a 5 star unless you want to. But there's tons of bugs and glitches, like right now, I can't log in and it keeps having errors(Error code: 1001_1, 1001_3) and it's getting annoying, i haven't been able to log in for 2 days now, I've tried clearing cache, restarting my phone, and switching networks. Nothing's working.",Negative
"It's a fun game and I enjoy it very much! But lately, there's been bugs and lags. I couldn't log in anymore because it keeps saying error. Plus, I compared my loading screen with my friend's to find out the train in my screen is out of sight, so does the rock at the bottom. I'm guessing it's a glitch after the update. Either way, I hope it'll be fixed soon! I love this game sm!",Negative
"Story-driven turn-based RPG that has a lot going for it. Stunning visual design (though, please let us skip ultimate animations), good sound design, and so far accomodating to free players. My only gripe is that exploration so far is rather linear. Zones contain minor side-objectives, but they are a bit underwhelming. Maybe this will change throughout the zones, but ~10hrs in I find myself a little bit bored with the zone progression loop, and the story is mostly what drives the game forward.",Positive
"The game play is not bad and the story isn't that bad either, just right. Although there's multiple glitches that's bothering me, whenever a cutscene plays it keeps moving and freezing like a stop motion cutscene, and the loading screen glitch, I had to log in 3 times a day just to play honkai, and finally the movements, whenever I play as a character the legs and the body glitches and duplicate. Please fix it ASAP, please and thank you.",Positive
"The game is fantastic. The storyline is great, characters are well designed, movement is easy, art is awesome and maps are truly thoughtful and well structured. You can interact with almost everything. The detailing is without doubt breathtaking. Till now, I have not seen any problems in the game or faced any kind of bugs or issues. The only thing I am unsatisfied with is ""no jump feature"", I think a jump feature would enhance the gameplay. Other than that, the game is totally recommendable!",Positive
"The game is totally worth the wait. The characters are well written (mostly kafka üíûüíû) and the story is somewhat entertaining. The gameplay is a little bit boring if you were to ask me (especially the combat part). Unlike the other hoyoverse games you actually have to calculate your moves and attacks. ( you use your skills and then have to wait for the enemy to attack, it reminds me of the tgc event from genshin impact)",Positive
"I really love the game. The art style, animation and gameplay are all really good. However, the late game is really hard, and I didn't grind enough before reaching it. Now I can barely clear the latest content and I don't really have time and resin to grind to catch up. It'd be really nice if they added a feature to reduce the world level or difficulty or something like that, cause not everyone would want to grind relics.",Positive
"I came into this game thinking I wouldn't like a turn based game at all. Wow, I was so wrong. The storyline is so gripping and investing, and it implemented a lot of features their open world game lacked - farming for characters is so much easier (although still difficult, but life isn't easy so). This game has made me come back daily for more.",Positive
"I really love this game.. The quality, the character design's, and the Voice Actors. But there's some bugs happening. Any time when I haven't played for only one or three days, it exits the game automatically. And to fix the big is to delete the game go back in.. Download it back and wait for it for like 5 hours.. It's annoying and tiring to download it back. This bug happened to me for 5 times.. If unind fixing the bugs.",Positive
"Normally I don't leave ratings, but this game is solid. While I do have some gripes, it's clear the developers take user feedback into account, and nearly a year into playing it, I find that in all aspects (writing, character design, UI, music, mechanics) you can tell it was made by people who were happy to work on the project and are doing their best. You can also put it down and play it later with incredibly minimal FOMO. Also, great humour and an incredibly relatable main character.",Positive
"It's a great game that I enjoy playing. It's the second hoyoverse game that I've installed after Genshin Impact and I love both of them. The stories, the designs and the characters are awesome. But there's just one issue I have and that is very very low quality of the screen. See, I have Genshin Impact on this device too but the quality isn't THAT low like the way it is here. Please fix it. The streets, the houses and the whole environment isn't clear at all. Overall thanks for the effort.",Positive
"Picked it up on the second phase of 1.2, and so far, this has been one of the best mobile games I have ever played. Turn-based RPG with mechanics that keep it fresh and engaging, that also get revolutionary with every new character bringin in new mechanics. QoL has been great, and while the Relics are still as random as ever, the development team is much more receptive and understanding, that makes me want to respect the game even more. I fully support the game, and if ever needed, criticise it.",Positive
"I really love this game as it has a stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and a compelling storyline. The character design is also exceptional, and the turn-based combat system offers a strategic depth. With regular and quality of life updates, I couldn't ask for a even better game to enjoy on the go. Goodjob to the Devs and the team and keep up the good work!!!",Positive
"It was really great experience. The combat looks simple but really engaging, combined with semi-open world which is not too much to be barren. Great characters design and lore, but the main story was a bit rushed, especially during the 2nd planet with a lot of side story fillers. I hope they fix that in the future! Music? Without a doubt is one the best so far. It enhanced my experience especially during the boss fight to tenfold. And most importantly it's F2P friendly :D",Positive
Fun game that you can pick up and play anytime. The game might look simple as it's a turn based game but there are a lot of factors and methods that you can manipulate to get the edge over tough bosses. I do however think the equipment system needs some work. I spend so much energy in farming equipment but most of the time am left empty handed.,Positive
"This game stands among a few right now that are living examples for the high demand for true turn-based battle systems. Some companies (looking at you Square) may have *some executives act like it's a long dead relic but, here it is, gorgeous, fluid, beautiful. Yes, it is a gacha but! this game can be 100% FTP!! Don't believe me look up ""no pull account"" you'll find some people all story content without even using the freebie pulls Hoyo gives us all!",Positive
"I really love the graphics, seriously. And the characters and quest. Is really enjoying and relaxing. It's been 2 years i played this game. I really like it, aaaa‚ú®üíê",Positive
Everything in the game is Amazing from personal experience. i like the character design and the animation and quality are Actually better especially the Imbibitor lunae water scene! The rewards too are very good and the characters are fast and easy to build. the Lore is a bit suprising from all the events and things that are happening but it's also pleasing and well-written. i hope to see more of the game improving in the future.,Positive
"Really fun game, I especially love the management mini games in it, and wish there were more of that kind of content. The gacha rates are pretty fair and it's not bad for free players BC there's lots of stuff you can do to get gems. The characters, story and music are fantastic. Some of the area designs feel a bit empty in the first few areas but this improves as you progress. The UI can be a bit overwhelming when you are in the main screen but you get used to it after a while",Positive
"NEW EVENT SUCKS. I keep getting matched with players who literally don't touch any grass whatsoever. Plus, the rng sucks, I tried every bird, but I never win anything because the FRUITS ALWAYS DONT MATCH UP.",Negative
"Story started strong in Jarilo-VI, got lost in Luofu, and then crashed and burned in Penacony. Gameplay HEAVILY incentivizes playing the flavor-of-the-patch meta. Unfortunately, building one character takes 5 amber eras, so by the time you've built the new team, the meta has moved on. Furthermore, perhaps because of player demographics, the game is turning into shameless bait for waifu simps. Player community also suffers from a perennial chip in the shoulder about Genshin.",Negative
"these people somehow made turn-based combat fun cutscenes are fire, character design is amazing, aside from the gacha aspect(characters & relics), this game is a 10/10 If this game fits on your device, then definitely give it a shot story wise, i feel like its a lot more interesting compared to genshin(game made by the same devs)",Positive
This game story sucks. It's so confusing and so boring!!! What a waste of hours on the penacony world!!!,Negative
"New unit every three weeks that powercreeps the last. Their version of ""Endgame"" is just an advertisement for the new on banner characters; with Huge buffs and beneficial game mechanics for them and element restrictions for the previous new units. Basically the game is dirt easy if you have the new units, and annoying if you don't.",Negative
"I love this game very much, it's genuinely one of my favorites. but there's only one issue. whenever cutscenes play, the audio will experience an audio distortion (?) and it'll lag. the cutscenes run just fine, but the problem is the audio. i rlly hope you guys can fix this as soon as possible, thank you. an update here, now even the cutscenes lag. please fix it it's annoying ngl",Negative
"Good for casual players. Really chill and fun, and story is so good as well.",Positive
"I really like the quality and all of that, I like the turn base game elements and the idea of a space themed game aswell, the thing is the story doesn't catch my eyes but that's just an opinion you can't change and also I have problem with playing it on my phone. Laptop is fine but I really want to play it on mobile to save storage but the game keeps on glitching, like it makes the character's eyes and their faces look transparent and even some pathways in the game becomes invisible to me.",Negative
"Love the story line, the characters, the ability to text them and also the F2p friendly environment. The main problem is that the phone overheats after 10 minutes of running the game on low quality graphics and 30 SPF,and I've been looking for the source of the cause, and I've began to realize that it has nothing to do with the phone or other apps running in the background, nor the data usage. I've played Genshin and sadly, the said issue only occurs to honkai.",Positive
"One of the best turn based game ever. I never imagined I would get hooked to it. The character designs are anime style, top notch. The animations and audio is so damn good. There's 4 different voice over to choose from, very inclusive. Not too lengthy but repetitive farming to build characters. Events are very good though. Plenty of rewards, very F2P friendly. Love it.",Positive
"Takes too much space... Like.. a lot of space.. like.. it's good and all, but it takes up so much space..",Negative
"Great Game and pretty F2P friendly. The plot is fascinatingly well written and does a great job at it's character and boss designs. Combat system is also something to praise at, plus you can get used to it pretty quickly and the animations for the attacks are just satisfying to look at. My only gripe with HSR is that artifact farming is just horrifying if you don't get lucky with the main stats, but even that got mainly fixed. Super recommendable!",Positive
"We might encounter some bugs for now, but I understand since it just got released. I know they're still trying to fix any issues with the game, but otherwise the story and the characters are very likable, not to mention the graphics for this game. Hopefully the bugs will be fixed, though sometimes the game automatically crashes and stuff, but otherwise I do love the game<33",Positive
"I've been playing the game since day 1 and I love the gameplay. The game is worth getting a 5 stars review from me but there is a minor problem that could be solved. When switching apps sometimes Android kills the process of the game, when it happens during a fight you have to do it again from the beginning and you don't get the technique points or energy back. It would be cool if HoYoVerse could change this and let the player continue the battle after the process of the game being killed.",Positive
"After playing for a while it feels like a chore, causes headache. Open-world is a joke. End game content is pretty hard for beginners, especially with limited resources. Loosing 50-50 every time disheartened me. I gave up on this game. Com'on HOYOVERSE, it's ur 1st anniversary.",Negative
"I love the game, and the characters. But I'm not supporting a company that willingly platforms confessed abuser VAs and abuse defenders. You can do better than this, miHoYo.",Negative
"I don't have much to say, other than this is great and has been for the year it's been released Learning from guides and stuff on YouTube if you're confused and you should be able to beat everything even free to play, like I am",Positive
"I've been in love with this game since pre-registration. The musics, the designs, the character and the plot written is absolutely astonishing and even plot twist for me. I enjoy a good puzzle alongside the turn-based rpg. However, i have encountered a bug that is even unable for me to trigger some puzzle mechanism. How do i fix this?",Positive
"Seriously, well done. This has to be one of the smoothest executions of a new, high budget game I've seen. Hoyo delivered. Engaging, challenging, fun, visually stunning. And the UI is so much smoother and faster than Genshin. Quick load times. Things like synthesizing can be done from anywhere instead of having to go to another loacation each time. I hope the game just continues to get better.",Positive
"I LOVE LOVE LOOVE THIS GAME SOO MUCH!! THE CUTSCENES AND CHARACTER DESIGNS ARE SO AMAZING AND SO IS THE TURN STYLE COMBAT SYSYEM, I LOVE SEEING LITTLE ANIMATIONS FOR ALL OF THE CHARACTERS! THE STORY IS SO AMAZING AND THE GRAPHICS/SCENERY IS BREATHTAKING! I LOVE HOW SILLY THE CHARACTERS ARW AND THERES ALWAYS SO MUCH TO DO! THE PUZZLES ARE REALLY FUN! THE MUSIC/BOSS MUSIC IS SO GOOD AND REALLY SHOWS THE MOOD OF THE WHOLE SCENE! I LOVE THE DESIGNS OF THS MONSTERS YOU HAVE TO FIGHT! I 100% RECOMEND!",Positive
"Used to love the game... Was looking forward & patiently waiting for great male harmony units. But after the favouritism kept on showing, made me down & not looking forward to anything anymore. I don't think HSR will balance things out for Male Characters collectors, not in the future too.. They want to make second HI3 on HSR...",Negative
Can you guys add multi-player and teams so you can play with your friends and it is a great game btw,Positive
i have been playing this game a month after release after a friend recommended it. i love the auto battle and speed options as they help me save more time and do stuff more efficiently. the characters are so pretty and have creative designs and lore and the storyline is amazing. it hasn't been a year since this game released and i can already see a bright future for it,Positive
I like the game and have lots of fun playing but my account was deleted for some reason I use my Google account but my data keeps getting reseted so now I have to start from trailblazer level 1 again pls fix this so it doesn't happen to anyone else I am a mobile and I love the game but just fix this problem and it will be a 5 star,Positive
I love hoyoverse games. The characters and storyline and graphics are all amazing,Positive
"HSR is a perfect mix of good storyline and turn based game, Gameplay is phenomenal, characters are well written and designed even the environment is unique in its own way. Rewards are generous than Final fantasy or 7DS/Arknight.One complain the HSR has poor farming mechanics. It would take week upon weeks to get the perfect stats and sbstats for your character to show it's full potential. Last thing why y'all devs don't release more paths Unit. Nihility and harmony units are tiring us.",Negative
I'm sorry. I love this game but the aventurine boss is so much rng. A feedback I have in the first phase. Hit two dice. 3 + 1 against a higher number. Don't get me wrong I can do 2nd phase to the point only my healer gets a lower number hence only healer will be imprisoned. SU9 was easy like auto. (bs kafka nihility path) but aventurine boss is such a different kind of check.,Negative
"Amazing game, amazing visuals, and most of all... amazing characters. There aren't many flaws to this game. It's one of the better apps made by Hoyoverse.",Positive
"Its an amazing game overall great graphics and good characters, but the reason why i didnt give it a full 5 star is because there are times where it would just freeze into the loading screen and never load into the game, but overall great game, gave it a 4 star bcuz luocha is hot.",Positive
"Good story, character designs are clean, the graphics are so good, and the animations are just spectacular. And most importantly, unlike genshin impact, honkai star rail is so generous when it comes to rewards. It always blew my expectations away cause it keeps getting better each updates. But the thing is, I wish there were more contents in the game to help me keep playing the game. But other than that, this game is an amazing game and i fully recommend this game",Positive
"An epic adventure of the milky Way! Such fascinating and interesting lore and designs, along with the quests! Totally a fantasy one would desire. Although there are some issues I am seeing ; such as the logging screen. It takes a devastating minute to load. And as you get higher levels, you start to loose interest, and feels like there is nothing to do anymore. Que to this lacking, I don't log on for some days. But I hope you solve it in the future! Please take some rest whenever needed! ‚ô•",Positive
"Pretty unplayable for me. I love the game, however, after the recent updates, it's unplayable. When you open the game to the title screen, half of the train is missing. And once you get into the game, tons of objects like walls, part of the floors and stuff are missing aswell. It'll lag and it takes 2-3 minutes till it takes action on the part i click.. not long after, it crashes. I hope it gets fixed.. Edit: Nevermind. Contacted Customer service and it's my devices fault. Great game.",Positive
"The game is nice. I have fun and enjoy the mechanics. However, my device is fairly new and the game often crashes mid battle. Due to this, I have to restart my phone and start the battle from the beginning again, even my ability points remain consumed without giving me the buff. It'd be great if you fix this or at least allow players to keep fighting from where they left it even if they leave the game.",Negative
"Very good turn-based rpg. Animations look nice, gameplay is fun... One big issue though: they brought the awful RNG based system of artifacts from genshin into this game... It's better here cause you can craft the pieces of the set you want every once in a while, and also choose a main stat once every 6 weeks, but you're still subject to a TON of awful RNG.",Positive
"how do you have a place in this game that is in the jazz era, but have no black people in it? they are the ones that made the era, i would expect at least one black playable character in, but to my dissapointment there is none. do better.",Negative
"The story and visuals are pretty good. The combat was surprisingly fun despite its simplicity. It also has an auto-battle system that makes it easy for you to focus on other things during fights, which is really helpful for grinding. You hop in, let the game grind for you in the background for a bit, you hop out. Boom. Not a lot of time wasted. Perfect for mobile",Positive
"This game is amazing, I love this so far! Good graphics, pretty nice story and cutscenes. It's perfectly fine and playable for me. I haven't encountered some crashes or any major lags. The only problem is the error logins. I have to reload the game a lot of times, reopen it, or even verify the game files and resources in hopes to make it work. I also play on pc, and it's also the same. It says, error code log-in 1001_1. This doesn't occur to any games, not even in genshin. It's so frustrating.",Negative
"Very pretty, very fun. Tho i have issue with performance on my weak phone. Game runs ok with minimal graphics, something lags, of course, but no big deal. Pure fiction though... In the middle of the battle everythings gets so laggy, sometimes it freezes, sometimes app has to close itself. Not cool(. 5 stars cuz this game has Jing Yuan and soonly will have a Boothill.",Positive
"This is a really good, high graphic game. Even as an mobile user; I have very good graphics and the cutscenes are very smooth, surprisingly. Although I have been experiencing bugs such as: not being able to log in, and etc. I hope you can make a feedback on this comment and clear these issues. üôè My overall rating is, that it's a very good game. This game Being kind of - a newish game, it still has some bugs to clear.",Positive
"Love it, makes turn based combat fun as hell! I'd love seeing some skins in the game.",Positive
"Wonderful game. I love how the main character actually has a personality and humour! The dialogue option choices are great too. One thing however, is the grind for relics. I've recently reached Lvl 41 and getting good relics is something that is hard. Small request: I'd like it if there was an option to set how many rounds of battle to do when I'm farming for relics, like golden calyx. I think it would be a smoother experience. Personally, I like doing work while setting it to auto battle.",Positive
"Yeah no. That aventurine boss battle needs another nerf. Theres absolutely no way you can benefit from anything othar than the characters, no strategies just gambling (which i get is the point). Theres absolutely no way to lower your level to progress through the story, no way to do anything other than just try to build characters you never have built and no materials to do so. Seriously please change it.",Negative
Before anyone expects Genshin impact gameplay. This isn't it. It's marketed as turn-based so expect turn-based combat and strategically using your units. With the time I have spent playing up to now. This has become one of my favourite games from the mysterious story to the tactical gameplay mechanics (you can auto if lazy). Very satisfying to take down harder enemies above your level utilizing what you have. The OST has great variety (even lo-fi). Can't wait to see what more this has to offer!!,Positive
"Been playing for months and have to say it has one of the best turn based battle systems i have ever seen in a game. It has a much better free to play model than others i have played. Its grindy but i dont mind that the story is pretty good with regular updates to it, good voice acting and nice charater designs. Hard and fun end game content to keep you interested. If you like the older turn based final fantasy games you will like this a lot i think.",Positive
"Laugh, cry and more... I came to this game for the battles and stayed for the story. The voice acting adds depth to characters and the script displays the diverse communication from myriad people. The visuals are stunning and the 3D environment can be augmented when you have different tasks (dog scent, memory). The learning curve is managed well. The battles are fast and varied enough not to become stale. The controls are suitable for a phone. For a mobile game, this is truly breathtaking.",Positive
"Amazing game, especially the writing! It has interesting lore and great humor. Graphics and character designs are pretty. Also, it genuinely feels like creators care about the experience as updates keep improving the gameplay. Sadly doesn't have much multiplayer content yet (only a friend list, chatting and borrowing other people's characters). It'd be fun to interact with other players in-game a little more.",Positive
"Doing great so far....able to play now, though Errors still come often and I have to restart my game 1-3 times before I play. It's getting really annoying, but the game visuals, characters and story are just top-notch. Hoyo's games are never a let down, but what I love is that, the time to claim the rewards is much faster and storyline, tasks, feel faster because of interesting interactions rather than repetitive slow-paced dialogues in Genshin.",Positive
"I haven't been able to beat Adventurine in weeks now. Even when I do have weakness break characters, he just keeps attacking and attacking non-stop.",Negative
The game is so good and it gives alot of rewards! For ppl that wants to play the game the game cost 20gb+ of storage and it's a turn based game if you don't know turn based you're characters have attack one then the next character overall I haven't incounterd any problems they were all fix in the updates I recommend for you to download the game if you have 20+ gb,Positive
"Very good, as someone who's lazy to defeat enemies hundreds of times i give this game an applaud. The minus is that, although my WiFi's good and stable it would continuously say my WiFi's off or that i would have to restart the download resources leading me to have to use my data. this has been happening countless of times this week and it's only Tuesday, I understand that it's a new game so i will let it off, i do hope you'll fix that. Overall it's an amazing game!",Positive
"I've been playing this game for a while, and as a burnt out Genshin player this game is definitely a breath of fresh air. The gatcha system is still a pain but we get a lot more resources in this game than in Genshin. Honestly I'd recommend this game to anyone.",Positive
"It's a real fun game, the story line is well made. But my problem is that sometimes, even with internet connection, i lag, or freeze. My screen just stops for a few seconds, and it hasn't happened just once, it happened quite alot. So please fix this bug thnxx. All in all, quite a fun game. It's a bit hard to know all the controls if you just started playing, so sometimes to find a specific button, you have to press all of it just to find the one you're looking for",Positive
"The game is really good but it clearly wasn't made for mobile devices unless you have a super expensive gaming phone. Every update is like 5 GB so it requires a lot of space. Visually fantastic, the music is awesome. It's turn based genshin but sadly not for mobile. It crashes on my One Plus Nord Ce during cutscenes and loadings. Waiting to play it on the PS4..",Positive
"As of 2.1 the game crashes often during cutscenes. No issues with battle, puzzles, nor exploration. It is annoying because sometimes you will be in an extended one and you have to re-watch.",Negative
"Definitely recommend, cool characters and stuff, sometimes the dialouges are silly but there's just one glitch I encountered. After I set the reflections up and exit the settings everything on the background turned white, but I fixed this by setting reflections to 'very low', I found it on a very helpful tutorial on YouTube. I hope it helps who else had this bug.",Positive
Smoothest animations ever. One of the rare hoyo games to actually keep the story moving. Hardly any filler content. Lots of QoL improvements.,Positive
"I've been off and on about this game. It was off to a good start when I first started playing almost 2 days after it came out, but recently that has changed. I rarely play because this game just feels like a chore. The enemies are way too strong for f2p players, relic system is terrible, credits and talents are too expensive to upgrade. This game is not f2p friendly at all.",Negative
"I am very disappointed, and that's pretty much all. I was blown away by the graphics and over all style of the game, but the stillness of the battles completely ruins it for me. Its a total no brainer: just gotta click click click, wait a hundred years for the enemies to fight back, and done! Battle won. Unlike genshin, theres absolutely 0 strategy or brain energy needed to complete a battle. That makes it super boring, which is a shame because the game has some potential. Total bummer.",Negative
Fun game but uses the jazz age as a world concept while having the only dark skinned character is completely unrelated to it.,Negative
"A likeable intermediate turn-based game mechanics, characters, and story plot in my first launch. Although I have one problem: in some ""special"" cutscenes, the resolution just unknowingly increased even though I previously set it on a very low setting and some characters' movement glitches. But minus to that, I come to develop a liking to the game and I am looking forward to see how I can make memories and experience while the game is still there.",Positive
"seriously, people does not talk much about the grind in this game. Like for example, rng on relic sub stat is so random that make us want to grind more. It does not allow us to choose whatever we want. Like this game is not for the people who only can spend time on weeekend. Once you fully build up your team, you just switch off your brain and press autoplay, not really using much strategy at the endgame. One other things is we can't rewatch the cutsence that's been completed.",Negative
"This game is one of the best games I've played, but there's many things, after you finish the main story there's really nothing to do other than side quests but those are time consuming and give lackluster rewards. Don't get me wrong there is the simulated universe and forgotten hall but those take grinding to do and I really don't have the time for that, also the special events are lackluster to because you get minimum rewards from them. Although there are many flaws the wishing system is fine.",Positive
So addicting. Genuinely fun and a good story too. Best hoyoverse game by far.,Positive
"Truth be told, experience's been great thus far, but that said, it has its flaws too, but it's not that major and is only based on my personal preference. Graphic-wise? It's to DIE for. The lore's a blend of mystery, yet the dialogues are quite witty. Grinding's a bit of a stretch, but nevertheless bearable. Character designs and assets are beyond creativity. And Penacony's been a wild ride; it absolutely takes the spotlight away from Jarilo and Xianzhou Arc.",Positive
"A glowing 5-star review for Honkai Star Rail! The game offers stunning graphics, engaging gameplay, and a captivating storyline. The diverse character roster and strategic battles make it a must-play for fans of the genre. However, a notable bug occurs when entering rooms, causing an abrupt blank screen. Despite this issue, the overall experience is exceptional, and I hope the developers address and resolve such bugs in future updates.And make it easy for change username!?",Positive
"I loved this game so much the graphics, art and character designs, scenes story etc. but ever since a new update I can't open the app anymore :( . the cutscenes are laggy everytime I explore it's still laggy and I can't help but feel like there are missing features, just a few tho, I really enjoyed it. but if you could fix it I'd appreciate it so much but please fix the issue fast I miss my jing yuan :')",Positive
"Really good game and I like it a lot. I like the story (except Xianzhou) and the character are really unique, especially making characters that is similar to other characters from different hoyo games like Bronya and Seele just to name a few. One problem that I have is the farming, it sucks. It is much better than Genshin but still terrible because there is really a really rare chance that you get a relic that you want.",Negative
"I've been playing this game basically every day, I even started a second account because I have completed everything in the first. The grinding takes a lot of time (after level 40) but I personally don't mind. The artifacts you get randomly can do very well, my character works best with half random half grinded artifact set currently. It will change once I get to 5* but not now, plus the 4* characters you get are very useful. P!MC and Natasha are amazing and March is perfect if you get Clara.",Positive
I love the game but when you reach penacony it starts getting harder and harder because of the new bosses,Negative
"I've encountered two main issues with the game so far. Firstly, the audio lags badly during cutscenes, which is quite frustrating. On a positive note, I do appreciate the classic approach that the game has taken, similar to Genshin Impact. However, I am not a fan of repetitive tasks such as playing hide and seek with children in the storytelling. For reference, my Trailblaze Level is currently at 14. I may update this review if I encounter any further problems üòä.",Positive
"Love the game! Tons of readables, side quests, and dialogues to keep you entertained. The story is really intriguing and well written with new faces coming out here and there and all seemingly having a valid reason as to not being known from the beginning! At this point I've gotten through the entire game so hoping for new content soon! As for any issues I've experienced though, every single water texture is missing for me on the Xianzhou maps, leaving the untextured parts pitch black and odd.",Positive
"Great game, great storyline, great gameplay Hoyoverse fantastic job with this one!!!!",Positive
"The game is good and all, but the app keeps crashing whenever I reach the final boss in the swarm disaster v lol this doesn't happen to me when I play on my laptop but my laptop is currently broken. Please optimize the game for mobile, I know for sure that I'm not the only one who experiences this. So many technique points wasted. Sometimes, I even have to restart the entire run",Positive
"It's good, it had amazing graphics surprisingly with a low end phone. The characters and interactions are funny and humorous but I just have problems with the game that keeps frustrating me. 1, the loading screen. I couldn't play for 3 days straight when the game was released after a week. And now the new update is out it's happening again. even though I have logged in, it keeps saying that error log in. 2, the cutscenes keeps lagging, the audio and graphics keep lagging and sometimes even crash",Positive
"There's a bug in the event on ver 2.1 Brother Hanu: Way of the wolf. Im at stage 3, The switching of lanes doesnt work in 1 tap. Hope you can check on it. Thanks",Negative
"It's definitely a top-tier game. From amazing graphics down to an emersice story and great character storie and designs. For a turn-based strategy game, the game is currently expanding, making it all the more engaging. Since the 1.6 update, it should become even more beginer-friendly. Developers are also very responsive to player/community feedback.",Positive
"I lost all of my progress cuz my account didn't save when I reinstalled, I don't expect it to automatically login I just want it attached to the Google account, I did not play to much so it won't take to long to catch Up but gatcha luck doesn't really have to line up with past accounts.",Negative
"The graphics, story, and characters are excellent. I was skeptical at first, but the turn-based gameplay turned out to be surprisingly fun and entertaining. The only drawback of this game is the frequent log in error. Sometimes, it takes me several attempts before I could log in. Other than that, this is a pretty smooth and polished game. I'm looking forward to its future.",Positive
"This is my all-time favorite game! I play it all the time, I play it in my PC and in my phone. I have not encountered any problems yet. The gacha system is really good, I love the graphics, the story is incredible (and always leaves you begging for more) and the characters are AMAZING! They are all strong and it's not so hard to get them, also, I think this is the first game I played where people use the initial characters by choice. I still use Trailblazer/Caelus and Dan Heng.",Positive
"The game, story, characters, animations and stuff are all really, really good but I do wish it wasn't a turn-based combat system and I like prefer the combat system as same as genshin Impact, honkai impact though. I'm not complaning, but I still prefer combat systems like that. But I do enjoy the game! I would be even happy if it had that kind of combat system! I have no other issues. I don't say this as an issue though, I just wish it to be like that...",Positive
"I like this game and would love to continue playing it. However, there's some things keeping me from doing so. 1) The floor and walls keeps flickering everytime and makes a very distracting disco party. 2) I haven't played the game for like, 1 day and when I do, the game lags and takes a longer time than usual to load before unexpectedly shutting down by itself. 3) Similar to the former, the train looks like it was cut in half and someone took a bite out of it.",Positive
"Pretty cool game, it's quite free to play friendly. The story is AMAZING the cutscenes are worth your time and the graphics are spectacular. I HIGHLY recommend your download this game üòÅüòäüòÅ",Positive
Honestly this game is too hard not to be that person but all you can do is grind your heart out and still have no chance don't know if I'm not doing it right but I'm fighting something that is lvl 16 but my characters are above lvl 20 and I die with it being more then half it's hp it just makes no sense but at least the graphics and story is good even though no one will read this if your going to get this game get ready to grind but for me I would rather just stick with genshin impact.,Negative
"Great game, one of my absolute favourite games. My only reason for 4 star is because if you are a non pay to win player, the 240 energy just isn't enough and it refreshes so slowly, it can takes weeks or even months of grinding.",Positive
"The game is really good, but damn, the lag on the cutscenes' CG is just really annoying. I've tried it on both my phone, but the issue is still the same. When I'm playing, the game runs perfectly and smoothly; it's just the cutscenes, bruh. It really destroys the immersion. Please fix it, please. I'm begging.",Positive
"At first I thought turn-based game would be boring but HSR became an exception for me. It's different than other turn-based games. Love the animations, stories and coming up with strategies to fight against different type of enemies! The only problem would be that each month 2 new characters being released which might put us in dire situation because they all look so amazing, not sure for whom to go for and whom to skip for rerun. Hard to make decisions :'D Overall, in love with this game!",Positive
"It has a great story line, and awesome graphics. Despite that, I think it would be nice if the puzzle difficulty could be increased. The combat is also rather repetitive and less exciting as genshin or honkai. Perhaps more tactical elements like reactions between elements, character combo skills, and such could be added to spice things up.",Positive
Heading towards Force to Pull late game content. Still no skip button for the yap fest,Negative
"Brick wall after brick wall is hit, the grind is more than any RPG should be Everytime I get the story moving BLAM right into another brick wall.",Negative
"I just noticed that in Stimulated World, when making final adjustments on relics before the boss fight the game freezes. I tried restarting the game doubting maybe it's a phone issue but my phone is responsive and wasn't lagging. Btw I'm using Snapdragon 778G just incase. So, after restating attempting to make a final adjustment on relics. The game freezes again‚Ä¶ Probably it's better to let you guys know if it's an in-game issue so the other's won't encounter the same problem.",Negative
"Hello dev's i humbly request a new option that a player can delete his story quest. after he finished it, so that the low end players can enjoy less lag when playing the game thank you",Positive
"it's a really good game !! i've played hsr since march of 2024, and safe to say i've enjoyed it a lot ! but there are some times that i can't progress through the story, but i believe it's just because i need to get stronger characters or need better strategy ! and there's often times that i can't do much because i did all the quests üòû",Positive
"Been playing since release and it is just amazing, like no words. It has captivating visuals and the main story is interesting. Characters are unique in their own ways, whether it be design wise or character story wise. It's easy to play, not so difficult to farm for materials as you can use a stronger player's character for help. So far so good, looking forward to what it holds in the future. Overall, just amazing and not a tad bit disappointing",Positive
"I really like the game, the designs are really awesome (besides some model bugs but I don't mind) and the story is really interesting, but there's a bug or something that frustrates me.. I keep trying to log in since a few hours but no matter how much time I wait and the amount of thing I change I can't log in again, it always shows up that there's an error and I should try again.. But good game overall, I just want to know what I need to do to log in again or if it's just a bug :(",Positive
"Okay so played for 2 weeks so honest review here. The game is great love the graphics the different types of characters and the battle system is great. My concern is I've completed the storyline now I'm grinding for trace materials etc. Also where's the events I would of hoped for something now. Star rail passes are hard to come by, you don't have any special offers which is bad, I'm not paying ¬£15 for 10 passes and get nothing id rather gamble and lose it. New update is needed",Positive
"I think the game is great at this moment, i had a bad feeling about the combat style but i found it fun actually and new, The light cones is a brilliant idea, the simulated universe is cool as well as rewards However its unfortunate that moving and exploring the world is very limited, we cant jump or climb or swim ..ect as well as the characters voices, each character repeat the same thing for each movement and have only one attack animation wich is kinda boring especially in the long term",Negative
"The mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics, characters are so much better than Genshin. Only sad thing is no co-op. Also sad thing that my phone gets hot. I wish there were devices that just don't get hot.",Positive
"It's a really good game, it has a great story and I do enjoy the game play and I don't mind the work you have to put into getting stuff. The only thing I have a problem with is how big the game is, I've had the game deleted for almost 5ish months now and I want to reinstall it but I can't without deleting half of my apps. But if you can download the game and you have some time everyday, for sure download!",Positive
"as a turn-based RPG lovers, this game is perfect. nice graphic, story line, battle system (i believe there will be major update later). i can guest that there will be summoning system, etc. unfortunately, the game caused too much heat on my phone as i refused to lower the graphic which is a selling point on this game. mihoyo never fails to amazed me",Positive
"As of 05/26/2024: I've played since Day 1, and I'm still playing. The #1 reason I continue to play HSR is that it respects your time. Dailies are short, farming is mostly automated, dailies are quick, events last a long time and most are completely released on the first day. The ""end game"" content is optional. And MiHoYo gives a lot of free pulls in HSR! Downsides: I'm a female player. HSR men are not the best. Could do better.",Positive
"I LOVE HONKAI STAR RAIL! The story is immersive and the characters are likable and there is alot of references to shows and other games.The gameplay is smooth and the graphics are high quality so overall I'm really enjoying this,just a few bugs here and there and it can be a little laggy but it's really good so far and I definitely reccomnded!",Positive
"I wish the story wouldn't be locked behind bosses where you need to put a ton of efforts and resources to even be able to barely beat the boss. I want to enjoy the story without worrying abt the combat part. I to pause the story, improve my characters or new ones that the bosses have weaknesses to and then I forget about the story so when I beat the bosses it doesn't feel worth paying attention to anymore. I don't care about the rest of the content, I just want the story to be more casual...",Negative
"Its a good game, amazing story, turn based combat style, good graphics, and explorations. Its perfect from me, thank you.",Positive
"I really like the fact that the dialogues when interacting with objects are very silly and humorous, I'd bet the developers had a great time making them. Aside from that part, there are certain times when I change graphics that the whole background of the game except for the characters just turns white, I'm not quite sure if that's a glitch or smth but I'm just stating it here incase someone experienced the same thing as I did.",Positive
"The main storyline is great and there are many fun& good characters to build. But the drop rates for many materials and getting decent stats for relics is such a grind that at near end game it's very depressing to be unable to clear Forgotten Halls properly. Also there's not enough new worlds being added and a ton of new characters that I want to collect, so the initial gem boost is kind of not replaced and likely to be a paywall to Gatcha the characters",Negative
"I just finished the new chapter, it's so good, please keep the quality, keep whoever is the main writer for penacony, keep it 12 hours story long each update if you must! Really good patch!",Positive
"Honkai: Star Rail is my day-to-day game to play, it's also my favourite game Hoyoverse has made so far! I love Genshin and Honkai too, of course. I don't really have any problems regarding the game, and I'm exquisitely satisfied with the rewards too!! Happy 1st Anniversary Honkai: Star Rail!!",Positive
It lags during major cutscenes and the audio does that as well (edit 5/3/24 stopped playing for a bit and recently reinstalled it still lags in cutscenes same as audio so i got to take it down from 3 stars to 1),Negative
"As of now, there is nothing to do after completing all the 1.0 quests. That's a good thing for me I guess. I could now farm materials to level up all of my favorite characters. I guess MHY learned from Genshin because they increased the Energy cap and regeneration. I just hope more animation or voice over when attacking. Respawning some chests per month. Anyway, the game doesn't have a scenario where you need to pull/warp characters. The starter/free characters are so good.",Positive
"It's a fun game, smooth graphics and unique style and the character and story designs are also great. The only problem is whenever I log in it would always say there was an error and when I switched account and return to my main account not only do I have to restart the whole game but all of my purchases would also be gone so I uninstalled the game. I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this but that's enough reason for me to quit since I don't want to lose money for no reason.",Positive
This game have a lot of potential. I really like it. But the problem is it's keep crashing when I try to talk to NPC. It's very frustrating. Everytime there's quest that need to talk to NPC it's start to crash most of the time. It's annoying that you always need to relogin everytime it's crash. Please fix that. I really enjoy this game.,Positive
Your everyday generic turn based game that passes the mark like many other games out there. I've been playing since launch and I'm not content. There's too many things to grind from the hundreds of level up materials. The maps are very limited and the side quests aren't good enough to elevate the immersion. Story is decent but not great. The repetitive animations of skills are very annoying when they say the same lines over and over. The battle system is nothing complex but simple. Average game.,Negative
"I love the turns mechanism, also, the story is so well developed and interesting that makes you wanna keep playing, not to mention the peak designed characters and their individual and unique animations. I have been playing since it released and never felt disappointed, in fact, the game development keeps surprising me. Currently one of the best gacha games available in my opinion! It's impossible not to feel attached to the characters.",Positive
"The game is very good, the animations are well made so are the characters designs and the events rewards are also good! Overall I really love the game but I only have one problem which is the storage it takes, it takes 25gb or even more and my phone can't handle it and we barely in 2.2",Positive
"The turn-based combat is more to my liking compared to their other games. It's not that hard to grasp the basic concept. The story isn't too difficult and can easily be beaten with the main cast and free characters. There's plenty of challenging content for those seeking something harder. Lots of heart put into the art, storytelling and music and I love it. There's a few things I'd like them to add and tweak, hence the 4 star rating, but I believe this game is gonna slap once the devs polish it.",Positive
Best RPG games I would like to recommend some good feature from this game Add more details on support character -know what support character other player use your character in the game from profile -number of times of other player use your character (specific character) -add description for the player in the support character so that the other will know some instructions from the user -Separate winning record From Pure Fiction and Forgotten Hall Edit what stat should highlights for character,Positive
The gameplay is very good the story line is also very awesome üòÑbut the new betal creature that they added is very dificult to defeat it keeps creating it's clones and my team cannot keep up with it cloneing technic üò•I hope they make these creature a bit more easy in the next update üò≠,Positive
"I've played Genshin Impact, this one fix some problems I had with the first game, but it is still a gacha game with an energy system that is necessary to level up, once you cleared all quests of course. The game doesn't lock you to play it, but your progress is stalled until you've got energy back, waiting or paying. I do prefer Star Rail since it's a turn based RPG instead of an open world action game.",Positive
"I don't like turn based RPGs in general. But I'm enjoying this game so much, It provides you with every exploration tool you need, even shows how many chests are left for you to open in a particular region. The BGM is really relaxing and battle music is also really good.",Positive
"Love it! The graphics is cool soo many mommysüò≥, I mean characters neat story line, but I wish whenever I go to a room it doesn't need to load, kinda annoying for me tho and playing it at least 2hour/s your get bored with it,but I'm really into it! And again another great game HoYoverse! Edit;hi it's me again, and I'm facing a new problem, after you open the game you feel a fps drop or sometimes it's just lag out and back to the home screen hope you can fixe it! That all thank you!",Positive
"It's a shame that i can't play it on mobile since there's no space for it. It runs super smooth on my laptop Super fun game, i never played turned based games for years. The little interactions we have on the environment tells us fun stories, it's worth it clicking on random objects and ended up being chased by guards somehow. The story is pretty good, i personally love the Belobog arc. The OST's are incredible, just as always.",Positive
"I don't usually rate games that early, but man, this is something else, finally a game with soul, with flavour. The characters are nice, well developed each shines in his own way, the story is well written, the graphics are amazing, the music is marvelous, gameplay is progressive and entertaining, the difficulty is perfect. Came in with no hopes, never missed a day after the launch. Truly a masterpiece.",Positive
Been playing this game since it was launched. Still very fun to play till now. I read alot of comments regarding to crashing and lagging when I'm using a super potatoe phone and never encountered any bugs.,Positive
Great gameplay and best rewards with amazing story. Needs more adjustments on graphics with older graphics card.,Positive
"Been playing this since launch and all I got to say is that this game is one of if not the best gacha game in the market at the moment. Great visual, great story telling, satisfying combat, fun and engaging community, etc!",Positive
"It takes about 19 GB to download it, and you are literally in combat doing nothing but pressing buttons bored every once in a while. You have to download something new, which consumes a lot of internet.",Negative
"Game has very good story ,world's, design, characters pretty nice, but when is about combat is pretty hard to win in game becouse all most every boss are hitting so hard and barely beat them, even tranquilizer 3 is so hard to do,rewarding in items are so hard to get something good. So im done to do something else in game no reason to try so hard when every rewards are so bad in exchange, Also on phone is working bad and lagging alot.",Negative
"would give this a lower score if I could. not f2p friendly at all having not one but two gatcha systems with very low success rates to get five star characters or items, it than takes 80 pulls to get a pity break which has a 50 per cent chance to get the thing you want. whilst I don't pay for gatcha the monetization on this is dreadful with one pull costing three pounds. on top of the awful gatcha the game is boring and combat can just be done on auto.",Negative
"Great game, enjoy it very much. This might seem like it's Ai generated because it's super plain but I really do enjoy it and would definitely recommend because the rewards for each update is pretty generous and this game is so funny and fun to play.",Positive
"This is by far the best gacha game I've played ever. The game is well balances: The graphic is great, voice acting is superb, the story is very well written, content is vast, humors are awesome, and it's quite F2P friendly.",Positive
The best turn based RPG right now...the story great the graphics the animation its really really good..i love this game so much hopefully it will continue update in future,Positive
"BEST F2P GAME IN HOYOVERSE EVER!!!! PLAYERS CAN GET MORE THAN 10000 STELLAR JADES EVERY MONTHS!!! THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN GENSHIN!!! if I have to delete some game, I definitely won't delete Star Rail. I will delete Genshin first.",Positive
this game basically saved my life i love it a lot. but please consider the optimization. it takes over 24gbs on phone? with all of the past quest data?and there's over 12gbs download every patch. this needs to be fixed.,Positive
Pllssss fix the lag when a story cutscenes plays it lags soo much and the audio also lags the game runs perfectly on my mobile but when a cutscenes plays it starts to lag plsss fix this soo I can enjoy the story.,Negative
"The drop rates are atrocious I keep having to pull hundreds to times to get the character I want and is some the worst RNG as of late but some guy over yonder can get multiple copies of 5* characters. This is why I don't spend a dime on this game and would encourage others to save their money too. You spend money and get nothing in return unless devs are doing this on purpose against non spenders. I have 10 pulls to get jingliu according to the ""pity"" if I dont we'll be having problems.",Negative
A good game overall if you like fast paced turn based with good graphics game. It provides good if not extremely hard challenge.,Positive
"Account was stolen immediately after I spent $1500 in the game, I mean literally moments after, I contacted support and was denied my own account and refused a refund on the product, it took them 3 days to email me passing the 48 hr mark for google. I am out a SIGNIFICANT amount of money for a product I did not receive. Don't spend money on this game, their customer support will deny you if you can't tell them the on the day to the hour your account was created.",Negative
"3D Turn based game that is actually both challenging and fun. Most importantly, it looks beautiful both in design and world design. That said. . Stuttery title screen with a lot of freezes and unresponsiveness when interacting with it which is strange considering the game can load and play just fine once I do get pass the title screen. Hoping for a fix in the near future.",Positive
Game is really fun until you start fighting enemies that can divide or call for reinforcements and for some reason the developers let the game balance can go out the window for example in the Space Station you will fight these Hercules beetles battle starts off 4:3 by the time they get done calling for reinforcements and dividing it's more like four verses 8 which really becomes annoying,Negative
"Good rewards, good character designs and backstories, overall it's good üëç It's just the relics that are hard to farm. ""Genshin could never"" we all say in unison. /J",Positive
The gaming part is fun I go on all the time to do my dailies I love how it's getting more interesting because of the story quests thanks to the game in general there's a few characters who I got to know and love including Aventurine <3,Positive
"starting from 2.0 it gets very very boring with minimum actions.. mostly just reading texts.. 1.0 is stellar, 2.0 onwards just average.. at least give us a SKIP button to skip the boring stories..",Negative
Avoid the equilibrium tests. The game right now is very unforgiving in endgame. I missed the the content because I was beta testing for hoyo. When I came back the game got so difficult I was soft locked from continuing. Down voted because I am stuck in a game,Negative
"the game's actually pretty good. Hoyo did a great job tbh. the mechanics really easy and everything's easy on the eyes, had a few lags but that's most of it.",Positive
It'll be more easy if stamina are faster and also the reserve stamina it's kind of boring doing nothing when all of the things are done specially grinding relics and traces please decrease the stamina it spend too much.,Positive
It's so unfair i spent 2GB for the first download . then i was kicked out for checking my phone and i was kicked out again and i checked the game again it was another update. i spent 5GB after the update i could not play it anymore i was stuck in those CoLlEcTeRs explanatory stuff... Now after downloading the update for 18 GB guess what I freaking was not even able to play it this is y'all's chance to not play this cancerous game there is nothing good here i quit.,Negative
Great game! I only have been playing for 3 weeks and I already found it amazing to play! The characters designs are amazing as well I'm looking forward for other new updates!,Positive
"Simply exquisite. The story is written to perfection, interesting characters with great lore anyone can understand. The gameplay features are amazing with except QOL updates. SOLID recommendation for anyone wanting a good gacha game to play.",Positive
Sooo Goood and the storyline is soo good and the character is very beautiful design too an i like the way of the story and i most like is in every new version have a free 10pull i love it this is what I'm looking the best of all games,Positive
Everything is perfect. Just can we get a future where we can delate story data that has been used like in genshin? This game will grow so big in the future and this feature will help a lot of device to stay playing and enjoying the game,Positive
I love the game and personally have played star rail genshin and honkai impact and it is just another great game. Enjoyed the story and warping for characters I love. Excellent game and can't wait for more updates,Positive
Has been playing during beta version and i can tell evrything improves so much. I really love it it has more fast pacing than genshin. I agree that the gameplay is not for everyone but for me its really fun.,Positive
extremely good turn based combat and able to have fun without paying money. gacha system isnt horrible and even without getting the best units you can still make really good teams,Positive
New boss is too hard. Needs to be nerfed badly. You really have to get a good group shielder to beat it and you're forced to use the very weak and useless Harmony Trailblazer in the Penacony story boss in place of the far better free group shielder Preservation Trailblazer. No I did not pull for Aventurine. Give us a free option.,Negative
"I love the gameplay and overall game in general, and this would be a 5 star if it weren't for the fact that it eats all my storage (over 30 GB!). Other than that great game!",Negative
Phenomenal game out of all of Hoyoverse's game has the best features in not only combat but overall all aspects. Especially love the generosity to give users a good amount of stellar jade's each update and always keep things exciting,Positive
"I loveee this gameee, from the plot to the character designs are so cool!, the game mechanics are simple but still really fun!, I really recommend this game:3",Positive
"This game is amazing, the story quest will leave you in tears, and the game play is very intriguing. The gacha system is very fair, and you get a fair amount of wishes each update. Overall, I highly recommend this game over other, especially Wuwa. (Let me win all of my 50/50)",Positive
It was a great game when I COULD play the game was very catching in visuals but now I have to play at lowest quality after the 2.2 update and I can only play for 1min to 3 min before the whole game crashes (it would be great if Star rail was on Nintendo),Negative
"Really fun, I've been playing since its release. Just like with genshin, a good story abd fun gameplay. If I had to say anything bad about it, I would say that we need more healers lol",Positive
I'm only I'm only ranking this well because it's very stupid how you have the email verification phone verification all verification it's very stupid if I sign in with my email on mobile I should be able to use the same freaking email on PlayStation and yet it doesn't let me I really hate restarting games,Negative
"Great game, way better in the gameplay and rewards mechanics and aspects then genshin, especially artifacts! Story is great, I like Penacony one alot, totally recommend!",Positive
"This game is actually the first turn based game I actually enjoy. The characters are amazing, the story is really good. I can play this game for hours and literally not even get bored.",Positive
"Best RPG system, deep story, cool character design, and simple heroes upgrade, many mini games, F2P, this game will be last long exist.",Positive
"peak fiction, shaoji and the whole writing team are geniuses, tons of endgame content present already and being updated regularly, beautiful world, interesting concepts, classic honkai style philosophy and so many lovely pop culture references. very excited for the future of this game and very pleased with the present state of it",Positive
"I'm sorry but I have a reason why I j made it 2 stars now instead of 5 stars before...my old account is gone and my progess after completing cocolia's boss fight before and I lost my progress just as i got back on this game for like 3months, I was so sad that I have to play back again thru the first story in the game..",Negative
"Need more playable waifus like mama Cocolia or real Miss Herta. There are too many males ruining the game & story. Except for the male MC, Welt, & Jin-chan (Blade), the rest of playable males are either ugly, annoying, or both. God I wish there's an option to delete them from my characters list, starting from that cringe Hyouka dude ripoff. Just make it like Honkai Impact 3 bc most fanbase only gacha for waifus. Also need more free/exchangeable 5‚òÖ light cones especially for Harmony",Negative
"Dear developer, I would like to give some feedback about some issue i'm countering right Now.. The Honkai Star Rail has a FPS frame drop like mine in infinix note 40 pro 5G Its kinda weird cuz When I play genshin impact its still normal and no fps drop too much... I hope your team will understand and improve the Game fps like you did in Genshin impact.... ~Delta Azure 25/06/2024",Positive
"Firefly is a one dimensional character with a boring personality, bland design and uninteresting story. The game forces you to like her no matter what and the developers clearly favour her over other better characters. I don't want to hear about your Firefly fetish anymore, Shaoji.",Negative
"My first gacha game has really set a high bar. The characters are fleshed out and interesting, and the latest story update was fantastic. The VA cast does a phenomenal job. Play this game.",Positive
"It's really great. Very generous free 10 wishes per new banner. Really easy to farm for Jades. Aventurine boss fight is all RNG so just hope you have good luck and I recommend bringing AOE characters so you have a higher chance of living in the boss fight, But the 2nd Phase you can only use those who went above the specified number so really bring AOE characters. Overall great game, I don't recommend doing Trailblaze 65 Ascension quest it will make you story bosses harder. Tho my ARTIFACT LUCK‚¨áÔ∏è",Positive
"Barely into it, still in tutorial, but game crashes constantly on a Samsung S23, which normally runs games far more detailed than this Gameplay atm seems fun, when it runs... will edit review when/if I can get further into game",Negative
"i always LOST in EVERY limited banner, on 80 pity. even when rate on still got character in hard pity. i dont have source for farm stellarjade again. im done playing this game. not gonna spend money in it again, just once is enough.",Negative
As compared to other gacha games it's far better in f2p friendliness. Great story good visuals music is also pretty good ngl it's smacks hard. Overall pretty good game and far better then compared to its older stingy sibling genshin impact,Positive
"The game is awesome and I love everything in it. The only reason I gave 1 star is that when I'm not connected to my house netwrok it always gives error code 1001_3, I have tried every solution but it doesn't work, but once I connect to my home's wifi it works fine, please fix this so I can give 5 stars, thank you",Positive
4 Stars due to having no option of lowering equilibreum level. The worst part is that I haven't cleared the part where I'd fight a weekly boss. I can't advance nor increase my characters traces,Positive
"everything in this game takes 100 hours to do. give me a skip button, i dont care about the yapping. i have to do a 6-7 hours quest just to be able to do the timegated event, are you kidding me?",Negative
The games Amazing i love and enjoy it but i always find myself experiencing difficulties with logging in it usually errors frequently and its frustrating and the lag,Negative
"Everything in the game is really beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è the graphics are nice, the animations are cool and the turn based battles are interesting as well. HoweverÔºåas a former beta tester and official player now, there's still one trouble I have. And that is, you can't jump üóøor climb and there's a lack of variety in animation for the movement when the player initiates a battle with a mob. That's all, thank you very much for reading my near useless rant, Btw can pls add more trashcans in Belobog? üóøPls",Positive
"Okay, tbh... Whenever i tried to login on my fb account, it doesn't let me and wanted a code, it won't send, I've been waiting for few hours now, could you please somehow fix it? i mean i had the same device and now I can't login. Thank you.",Negative
"At first I thought this turn-base rpg game it would be a boring after 2-3 days playing time, but recently I have experienced this HSR for more than a week it always comes with a new things along with the story goes. Considering this game is f2p, the gacha system in it is a bit annoying for me Why do I always get 5 stars at the pity limit? üò≠overall 4.5/5 gacha sucks",Positive
"it been a year since i played this game and guess what im still addicted to this game,the design is just my type and i love the new world so much!the xianzhou world is terrible but penacony is one of a kind~please continue with this improvement!",Positive
Love the gameplay wish there was more stamina available and if it would stop crashing after every couple seconds.,Positive
Love the game and everything but the thing that would make the game much better is if we could reduce the erudition level because we level up too fast,Positive
Game is crashing a lot lately mid battle after the last update. So annoying especially if you used technique points since you won't get them back in SU.,Positive
"Sad that I didn't get Boothill and missed him, but this is a great game nontheless, it's awesome, great and beautiful characters and places, gameplay is awesome too, truly a great game.",Positive
"hello there hoyoverse, im really enjoying the gameplay and the storylines, especially with the character designs, its just so cool...i also want to thank you for giving me boothill.",Positive
"Amazing, absolutely amazing. The music, godly. The characters, top-tier. Personally, this is one of my favorites aside from Genshin. Keep it up, Hoyo!",Positive
"terrible game, i keep losing the 50/50, it ain't even a 50/50 at this point, feels like a 10/90, 10 being the chance of me getting a limited 5 star, I'm tired of having to work twice as much for a character",Negative
"Add a skip button on the dialogue, not everyone is interested in the story. I'm sure a bunch of people left the game for this reason, nobody wanna sit around reading half the game.",Negative
"If you like story, this isn't Lord of the Rings Good, but I thought it was cool, so yeah, if you don't vibe with it, then play something else, I'm here because it's free and better then most mobile games also I love the big numbers",Positive
A very good game that I enjoy I don't play it that much stopped playing before pencony came out I still think it is a good game it has a very good story wouldn't say amazing just yet but it is getting there and the characters are amazing,Positive
Love the style of the game play and the storyline. Pulling for characters is quite fun and easier than it was for Genshin!,Positive
"Overall, the game is amazing. It loses 1 star because of how grindy it is, and how luck based, sometimes p2w to get a good character.",Positive
"I kept getting locked out of my account. It's getting frustrating. The message keeps saying many ""requests please try again"". I don't want to keep playing this game experiencing this. Keeps ruining my joy for this game.",Negative
Excellent. And nothing like its sibling game. This game is objectively peak. The story alone stands high among the rest of the other gacha games and simply has such high quality of life and respects your time. Truly excellent.,Positive
will now rate you 1 star now that wuthering waves is released and showed us you can have a proper skip button on the dialogues and cutscenes. i have been putting this on the feedback multiple times on hoyoverse games since genshin.,Negative
"it's a really pretty nice game , i love the gameplay, the graphics, the charecters, and the rewards are sooo much. it's quite fun for me",Positive
waste of time cuz half way through adventure the bosses buffs and debuffs aren't logical compared to the team u have. some bosses need specifics characters to pass. purchase packs are extremely expensive it's silly. u grind so much and then u hit a wall.,Negative
"I really like this game. It's gorgeous and more casual than many gatcha games, and the fact it supports controllers so seemlessly is definitely a plus.",Positive
I've reached a lvl where now story missions r f**king hard....r u kidding me..my equilibrium is maxed out..so i am stuck in the story...maybe a option to lower the equilibrium lvl might be good?..or maybe just make story missions a little easier.,Negative
Love the game and how the devs trying their best to make the game not repetitive and easily get boring. every new update is just Amazing. the character design the VA. event . The story it's just so peak!!!..,Positive
"This game came this game delivered Absolutely best game for me, bye genshin. Also please keep the good work developers keep it simple no need for the long video cuts and waste of money , I like the simple things on the game and story and the jokes ... God I love this game . Thank you all Edit : I did hit a wall at the end game tho.. Plz add a PvP real time content as end game u can reduce dmg dealt by50% ot smth... I just can't see a future for it with no PvP, it's not genshin after all.",Positive
I Can't even play the game it's really frustrating wanna know why the loading takes like 30 mins or longer I can't wait that long and guess what I have that same issue for genshin impact I want the loading to maybe only talked a few minutes instead of like forever people want to play the game fix this bug for genshin too,Negative
"Its alright, i hate that each new patch features challenges that would be easiest if you had the newest characters.",Negative
"Beautiful game but Pls add a skip button for cutscenes and why the game takes so much space and it's gonna get worse with more updates,But i don't think These devs actually care about the players :(",Positive
This has to be the worst game I have ever played. An outright scam I fear. The pulling system is absolute bogus and I think this game should be boycotted perchance (I didn't get boothill and I'm being dramatic),Negative
I have a Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus and after starting the game it continuously force closes anytime I open the in game menu or tap on the mission button in the top left of the screen. Please Help...!,Negative
"this is my favorite game so far, I play it when I'm bored and it cures my boredom,it's a fun game, with lots of characters I like, especially Aventurine. I love him. overall 10/10 game",Positive
This game is beautiful and everything is good so far keep it up. The character is unique too and they also have good mechanics of the game.,Positive
After 2.2 the enemies whenever it's their turn to fight they don't do anything and my screen is just stuck I cannot leave the battle or do anything it's just stays,Negative
"Story is great and fun, but the constant power creep is disgusting. Optimal character is E2 with their signature LC. Forgotten hall and other limited time challenges are tailored for the most recent power creep characters. Also let me mute Robin.",Negative
"Amazing game, great updates, very generous with giving away characters and resources considering this is a gacha game. Very good balance between fun game and the developers having to make money.",Positive
I have played it but not for long but the characters design is on a whole other level! I like the characters designs very much‚ô°,Positive
Its really a great game but they have to do something about the storage. As updates are increasing the storage is decreasing way tooo much üò¢ other then that the game is great üëç,Positive
The thing is. I absolutely love this game BUT it wont work. It needs hella wifi or something but whenever i try to play i cant. I think hoyo can fix this bro,Negative
Nice game but would be better if I don't lose so much 50/50. If losing 50/50 sometimes is a must preferably I can choose the character I want to lose into.,Negative
I love the game's mechanics and novelty! You'll have lotsss of fun playing this game even though it'a turn basedüòÖ The characters and rewards are reallly goodd,Positive
It's good but it takes so long to load and when I try to watch a video to pass the time it resets and I can't even play and I have to wait a longggg time pls make the loading faster,Negative
"Good game, plus good end game content, but the cutscenes are not smooth the audio often corrupts and the video is slow",Positive
The only game I like playing! It's so good ! Maybe a little bit long to get trailblaze but I like challenge so it's definitely worth it to try !,Positive
"Every time I open HSR on my phone, It'll always check for updates in game. This is annoying as heck when I'm in low signal areas using my mobile data. Can you just not? And instead leave the ""checking for update"" to play store? ü§îüò∂",Negative
"An incredible gacha game with great story, characters, and combat. They also respect your time and effort more than other gacha games like genshin impact, it is less grindy, and the rewards are overall better. The timed events are actually interesting a lot kf the time too, which cannot be said for other gacha games. MOST IMPORTANT: the game devs care about community feedback #genshincouldnever.",Positive
"Devs ! , i am a dev myself. I understand your hardwork you did to Make this awesome game. However, it might be good for both playerbase and the companies benefit to atleast make Relic farming little easier. I get whole concept of 50/50 , it's okay , U guys need to earn money , and u deserve it. But atleast after trailblazers manages to get a character , let them enjoy with them . Everything is awesome , just improve relic farming . Fellow developer and follower of akivili",Negative
"i love the game i thought my phone can't handle it when it first came so i deleted this game, and now im back and loving this game but sadly i can't keep up with events because im enjoying the story.",Positive
"High graphic, great char designs, and if you really like turn based strat games, rlly recommend it. (And also they are very generous)",Positive
it's a really good game but one time I accidentally closed the app and when I went back the character I was supposed to talk to was missing and where they were supposed to be they weren't there but other than that it's a really good game,Negative
"Dan Heng had a broken face whenever I tried to see his surprised expression. It went either completely black or completely white. It was hilarious. Best game, real. 10/10",Positive
Fix the login issues. Can't even login. It takes way more time to login. Except this problem the game is very good compared to other games created by hoyoverse.,Negative
"Amazing soundtracks, great character designs, free to play friendly with all the rewards. What more can you ask more from a gacha game? Hoyoverse has outdone themselves!",Positive
"I've been playing since Seele release, This is game is really comforting. The storyline, characters, gameplay and rewards are very f2p friendly and rewarding. I really recommend this game to everyone who likes turn-based games. It's a wholesome game. Plus, Both MC are given equal attention. I like it.",Positive
"Nice game, this is the best game, i cant explain, but i think that was a bug you cant go in to the museum in belobog, i think just that bug i ever see, but this the best game i have on my phone",Positive
Phenomenal game. Too much content if anything. Keep it casual and you'll have fun. Great story writing aside from the XianZhou.,Positive
It is a defination of a good RPG game as it can be played anytime-anywhere. The first gacha game I have ever played And the experience is butiful Overall 8.9/10 for me,Positive
"Tried it since I play Genshin. Ended up using real money to get a character. Didn't log in for months, now once I got back my account was clearly deleted as I lost all my progress and essentially my money. Very disappointing to say the least.",Negative
"It's a great game! Totally recommend! Everything is chef's kiss! Sadly, I had to delete because my phone storage couldn't take it anymore... :(",Positive
Relic set nerf. A new upcoming Break set relic got nerfed and made only for Firefly and HMC. Essentially any other break characters like Xueyi and Boothill won't benefit from what was supposed the new BiS set for Break characters. Obviously only favors certain characters.,Negative
I like this. There is a lot of unique character with different animation! Story is also good. The best game ever,Positive
"Love this game, and it creaters never fail to imerse me in the games they make. It's Defently worth the amount of space it takes on my phone.",Positive
"This game is amazing, the grafik, the characters, the story line, open world, all amazing, but it's lag a little in the game but ok üëå‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüî•üî•",Positive
"Can you cut or skip the story, kinda boring, watching story, not playing the game. almost 2 hours listening and watching boring story. or cut the 10k dialogue to 1k chit chat?",Negative
"Such a good game, never thought i will enjoy an Turn based RPG game, Good character design and eye candy visuals.",Positive
Game is about optimizing your character builds and teams so you can auto more content. You reward for improving your account is getting to play the game less.,Negative
The animation on their Ultimate makes this game SUPER AMAZING! I really love the storyline of this game. Keep up the good work HSR,Positive
"i reinstalled and my progress is gone. I don't know how to get on my old account. The game should remember you, especially when you sign in through Google and on the same phone.",Positive
It's pretty good i enjoyed it a lot my problem is whenever i play or talk to characters my screen turns black and leaves the game if you can please fix this h,Negative
I switched from genshin to this. I quite enjoy the RPG turn based and the story more then the crazy character swapping genshin has!,Positive
"worst game to play right now always so laggy, which causes my game to freeze on phone, i even tried to play on laptop which could play genshin smoothly, but the game still freezes every minute with 999ms, i see no problem with the latency only reaches up to 200ms in genshin idk why this game could have 999ms in SEA where my country is part of",Negative
"Game is alright but forces you to use characters which can result in your team falling apart within 2 seconds, remove this feature and I'll make it 4 stars",Negative
"The art style of this game is great, but there's just way too many cutscenes",Negative
"Interesting story, great narration, and funny off quests are the glue for this game that keeps you pushing for more. The fighting is simplistic but fun, I beat the game effortlessly without spending money, which is a nice change to see end game content. Obviously is has to have grind aspects to it, but you will only see this when wanting to progress into the lvls 60-80. I would say that its easy to spend alot of money on this game given how well it immerses you, gacha games are highly unethical",Positive
"Great story and gameplay. Very time friendly for adults with real life obligations. Various modes of end game encourage the use of various characters, needing strategy instead of doing every encounter with the same team. Of course, opening up the wallet will progress the building of characters faster, and obtain more characters faster, but definitely not necessary as everything can be done f2p if you build the characters properly.",Positive
"I really love the game!! I feel so blessed this was ever create, the characters were cute and their interactions with each other, the stories were awesome too! However, i was not able to enter the game lately bc of how laggy the loading screen is, it's been days since i can last logged in the game, it keeps saying connection error and I actually have a decent connection too. I just wish there are some ways to fix this. Im sure I'm not the only one with this problem. Thanks a lot, devs!‚ô°",Positive
"Love this game alot. Greatly exceeded my expectations, the story is fun and immersing, the way the story is told makes it 100% more fun, which is a problem i always had with this kind of games. The voice actors are amazing , the fight system is OK too, not usual but it's not as bad as I thought it would be , it's exciting sometimes even. 5‚òÜ Edit: combat system is sick, one of the best features in the game, it's engaging and thrilling. I would even search videos of people in hsr combat. LOVE ITTT",Positive
"It's a great game and it doesn't take to long to get a 5 star, but I have a problem where no matter how many times I restart or re download the game, the map doesn't render, I can only see chests, NPCs,and enemies, which makes it hard to move around the mapsince I keep running into walls.",Negative
"Its pretty good game and fun to play, but not for long time. It just feel so much less something to do in game after finishing the event. The event also feel too quick to finish and without 'realy' exploring feature, this game just nothing and kinda bored to being 'just that game you play'. But overall the animation, story and design is very awesome",Positive
"So far the game is great, love the dynamic of the game mechanic. Thank goodness it's a turned based game and it lets me think what's my next move (most of time I was so bored of the combat system in Genshin). The lore, the character designs, the OSTs were all great. There were few glitches here and there(cutscene audio). Hopefully it gets fix soon",Positive
"I love this game,I'm addicted! I really I recommend on downloading but expect about 1-3 hours downloading in the game (at least thats how long it took me). But besides that,this game is very interesting!! I love the story,the little side quest's,the graphics and characters! Really cool/cute designs and really good voice actors! Again,you should really at least give it a shot! (I'm not sure if I spelled everything right,haha sorry). As I said,I love the game and I hope you will too!!",Positive
"It was decent, nothing to complain about really. But some points may be the dullness of the side quests and that the endgame doesn't exist yet because you can't get enough xp for legendary relics, you also constantly get locked out of the main story, and because in the side quests there isn't any talking that is boring. But trying to find every chest in an area is quite fun I'd say so overall a good game!",Positive
Story of the game and quality is great but seriously what is friends list used for when we can't play together??! please solve this problem in new patch,Positive
"I am the type of person who likes turn based games, so this was something I enjoyed, the story is nice so far. It is smooth (at least in my device) the graphics and the whole style of the game is really clean, I literally love the ultimate animations of the characters, they are so interesting and cool. I would say the game is generous with the rewards. So far pretty good ^^",Positive
"There's issues regarding graphics, cutscenes' stuttering, framedrops while exploring the open world and during battles. It's not a problem I face with Genshin Impact, but it's a new game. Give this a few more months and maybe it'll be optimized better for my type of processor. Gameplay-wise, I definitely enjoy the story and the mechanics. It made me hooked into playing for hours. The only downside is the constant framedrops and lag. I would recommend this for high end android devices.",Negative
"I love the characters' detail! And the map is very good with its beautiful view! They have permanent events and free 10 pulls every patch, It helps me alot when it comes to pulling for new characters with awesome designs and their kit is very enjoyable and creative. Hopefully that you will add new chatbox, phone wallpaper and allow co-op like Genshin Impact, so I can play together with my friends which probably won't happen since it's a turn-based game. But still, keep it up!",Positive
The game and art style are good. I like the fast-forward and AutoPlay button. It made my game experience easy. The story quest are quite intriguing and the text messages that the characters send are kinda funny and fun. I was just kinda disappointed that I can't connect my star rail account in hoyolab. It's always says email already existed. My Genshin and Honkai Impact account are no problem on it. I hope you can fix this issue. There are also several players that have the same issue like me.,Negative
"It's a really good game! The battle system is weird at first if you expect a game to be like genshin. However , if you get over the battle system and pay attention to the story, you'll end up either satisfied or crying in the corner of your room (Bebelog broke me because my country went through something similar in the 80's.) The characters are really nice and they have better models than genshin models (diluc I'm talking about you.).",Positive
"Main menu lags by a lot and there is no option to enter a server without having to look at thousand entities. I have a 4gb phone with lots of storage space and it runs awfully slow even after successfully logging in. Wouldn't recommend playing it on mobile, use PC version for this. Genshin Impact is doing perfectly fine and runs smoother than on 4gb potato computer.",Negative
"Ive been playing since lunch but had to take a break for a few months, but i can confidently say that this game is so generous. I love the honmai devs, and thank you for your amazing job!",Positive
"The game is fantastic, the art is top notch and the quests are fun and easy to understand. How ever it is quite big, especially for me who have both Honkai: Star Rail and Genshin Impact on my phone, it is kinda hard to maintain the updates and I often find myself uninstalling apps or games that I do also enjoy to play. I had hoped that it would be something like Genshin where they add the ""past quest management"" but I couldn't find it anywhere so I'm stuck with 14GB of quests and other updates.",Positive
"Honestly, I see peoples problem with crashing but it has never happened to me. The game can be challenging of course but takes less time to progress through then the other games they have like genshin impact which I love. I wanted to warn others of anything bad, but nothing has still happened so I hope it stays like so. Also, they amazingly take payment. You don't need to pay to play the game at any point it is just an addon to get new characters. No ads as well so thank you hoyo!",Positive
"I love how your choices made diffenrence to the main story/side quest. I just hope that you can interact more of the objects from the games like being able to sit down at the bench, sleep on the bed etc. It's too bad to not be able to interact with those things since having this implemented will make the game more immersive and cool since it'll make the more different than the others.",Positive
"The game is great! I love the story line and the characters are likable, not to mention the funny moments with the mc, but the only problem I have is the graphics...I can't move it to higher quality without the graphics become a blinding white, and there are objects (specifically blue-like crystal objects being pitch black in color) that are like bugging. I don't know if it's a bug or if it's just a problem with my phone, maybe it can't handle both Genshin and Star Rail at once ü•≤",Positive
One of the best games I played and is certainly better than genshin which is being very f2p. Also unlike genshin u get 10 pull login for each 4 characters which is very help full to achieve the pity,Positive
"The game is amazing so far. However, I have encountered a problem. Earlier, I set my graphic settings to very low so I could play the game smoothly. But then suddenly, whenever I engaged in combat, the screen would just be stuck on the loading screen, and it would glitch out. I can hear the characters in the background fighting, and I can somehow control them, but I can't see them as the screen is stuck. How do I fix this?",Positive
"Haven't been able to play this game on my phone, galaxy s22, in 5 months after an update. Keeps crashing at the loading screen. Fix this issue! People spend too much money on this game!",Negative
This game is actually great btw I like the graphics I really like the Storyline in this Game I Really love the Characters In Here I wanted To Rate This a 5Star..,Positive
All the cutscenes are the best cut scene I have seen on a mobile phone game for just for mobile game it's the best story game I have ever played .make sure to give free summon tickets aswell,Positive
"Please put ""Guard"" option in fights, you can make the guard effect to resist DoT and reduce incoming damage AND ALSO SKIP TURN TO CONSERVE SKILL POINTS!! ü•∫üôè",Positive
"Loving this already. I love the combat style and the character's ult animation. Now I have 3 games from Mihoyo I am playing simultaneously ü§£. Only problem I have so far: When I am recording my game, the screen keeps blinking. Cutscenes no problem but on things like character screen or reading messages from other characters, it keeps blinking. Only happens on star rail. PLEASE FIX üòüüòü",Positive
ITS AMAZING! I loved the ults and etc. The problem is that whenever I'm fighting enemies it's really unfair for the enemies getting hitted very strong even tho they're low level below us.. it also needs to fix when fighting enemies since it can be annoying to people and unfair when they get hit very strong while the characters have high levels and when they hit them it's low.,Positive
This game has no diversity in skin tones even in places where it should and even the NPC's that are diverse in skin tone are at most tan.,Negative
"great game but takes up too much space, let us delete past events and quest files please",Negative
"The game has very nice plot, character designs and ran very well on my 2 year old phone until 1.4 update. The turn based gameplay is more satisfying than HI3 and Genshin's combat. The cutscenes surprisingly had good quality, even though I played on all low settings. Overall, it's a 5/5 the second I get a new-gen phone I'm installing this back",Positive
"The game has been misrepresented by the characters as some of the characters, especially in Penacony, are not represented properly.",Negative
"Decent story, great characters, good turn based combat. Gacha is still gacha though",Negative
"I love the game but it's so laggy for some reason, so I am giving this a 2 star. Do you mind fixing it?",Negative
They took every complaint from Genshin and applied the improvements here. 10/10 game with very generous rewards (unlike anothet game) and fun combat!,Positive
i don't have any problem with this game but this is a problem with zzz not being compatible with my phone at first my phone can run the game but now it cannot,Positive
Taking Chris Niosi as a voice actor for a new character is insanely disgusting. I want that terrible guy out of the game; I won't be playing hsr anytime soon because of this.,Negative
"i really hate the way this game nerf the upcoming character jiaoqui for the upcoming characters, cus they made him so bad, so it can't be played in pure fictional cus it keep spamming ult to stock up Acherons ult, so basically they don't want her to be good in pure fictional so they can sell Jade, wise move devs",Negative
The game is laggy and it won't start it's just show a black screen üò°,Negative
It's an amazing f2p turn based gacha game with so many good characters and it has many endgame modes also,Positive
I absolutely hate it and for the resource updating or something like that it takes freaking forever,Negative
"Bit grindy, but still awesome si-fi RPG with great music and deep lore",Positive
i love this game but it will be more fun if we could play it with friends ‚òπÔ∏è,Positive
Didn't get a 5 star character despite being guaranteed and not enough resources to level up,Negative
Huge favoritism towards female characters. Forced into a date scene with Firefly over 3 patches. No options to reject.,Negative
Good graphic. Good game modes. Good story.,Positive
Lack of variety in skin tones for the appropriate settings.,Negative
It's good I guess..but I'm more of a open world type player..but please let us jump,Positive
"The storyline of this game is very good and the characters provided are also very interesting in terms of design and abilities. Even though the players are F2P, lots of prizes are given every time there is a new patch or from events. Indeed, even though many enemies are very difficult to defeat, if you have a good strategy there will be no difficulty in defeating the enemy. Hopefully the stories to come will be better",Positive
"The game is great!! The graphics, story, characters, controls and everything! But..one problem though, my phone lags in some parts of the map. Like, it lags so baddd. Maybe it's just my potato phone, but i can't afford a new one rn :'<< so sadly i had to delete the game cuz i couldn't play the story at all because of the lag.",Positive
"The game is fun at first, but it became monotonous after 5 days of playing. The quests becomes grindy, you won't be able to progress if you don't complete the side quests since you need a ton of exp to unlock the levels. I've played at least 5 gachas before, the only one that stayed and never bored me is Arknights. Maybe because Arknights mechanics, gachas system and UI are just too good, that I've set a very high standards for all the gachas games. I'll rate it 5 for now since it's still new.",Positive
"10/10 Turn-based game, absolutely perfect! Mechanics work just like they should, and it's a really comfortable game for those who don't really have too much time. The story and visuals are mesmerising, and the graphics top-notch. I highly recommend playing this game since it will also be available on the PS5. The music, sound effects, and voice-acting make you feel like you're really into the game.I'm used to Japanese voice-over, but the other languages are really good as well.",Positive
"Everything is great but, you cannot reroll character. I started one and I wish I could start a new game. Hopefully they will allow this one day. Please dev's allow character deletion so we can try new things.",Positive
"Game is quite smooth on my device, not a single lag even at moderate ping. Characters have good composition have proper facial expressions üê±even better than Genshin . Storyline is catchywith great music. Graphics are awsome. One of the best [[[turn based]]] RPG i have experienced. But, game experience is same as genshin exept the turn base system.",Positive
"I haven't had this much fun in ages! The turn based combat is so chill, i just love it! There are so much cool and lovable characters. The story gets better and better with every expansion.",Positive
Now THIS is a game worth playing! Best mobile game I have played to the point that I play it on the PC now to enjoy better graphics. Another honkai masterpiece,Positive
"The game is incredible, its easy to play and have so much handsome and pretty charactersü´∞ but im having a bit problem on glitches, some of the stuff disappears when i get too close and the floor is gone, it wasn't like this before but please fix it if you can..the game is still great though! I dont lag although the glitches are my only problem,even if my graphics are in ""very low"" my game still has its glitches",Positive
"exception story with an expansive setting filled with fun characters. if you like turn-based RPGs and anime, it's a better game than Genshin Impact.",Positive
"Really good turn based rpg, but the tutorial is way too long, you don't have all the features before you hit account level 30. Having said that this will probably become a fantastic f2p single player experience after a while, if how big Genshin is, is anything to go by. Personally I like the character based weakness system, but the limited starting roster does make it frustrating at times.",Positive
"Absolutely love the game it's just the main problem is that some enemies are way too gimmicky, to the point where it doesn't feel like a game of wit more so a game of how hard i can bang my head against a wall. Still i love the game just hope the game doesn't get filled with just gimmicks, the gameplay and stories are still very nice keep it up.",Positive
"Each patch more than 6gb for JUST mainly difficulty update on end game content, the amount of SU update is so boring, just change the game name to Honkai: Simulated Universe. Where is the story? The MoC update keep getting more whale baiting. Not f2p friendly.",Negative
"I really love the game; the characters, the storyline, and especially the MC. They're so fun and their personality is everything. I also prefer the fighting style more than I did with Genshin and my only complaint is the lack of content. After doing all the quests I could get, claiming all the chests, and completing puzzles, there was literally nothing to do but wait. I hope you add more content, like the character's storyline and more side quests.",Positive
"Basically Final Fantasy/Dragon Quest meets Genshin in space. Its a modernized JRPG with a fast-paced and challenging turn-based combat (starts off simple but it gets way more in-depth later on and has gorgeous animations), the story is funny, characters are charming, and gorgeous visuals. Definitely here to stay, and the game is incredibly generous. Very much recommend, prefer it over Genshin.",Positive
"I really love this game. It got amazing graphics, story and a funny mc. However I keep getting this error 1001_3 everytime I try to go in the game. This has happened abt 2 or 3 times before I can go in the game. I just updated to the new vers, now I can't even go in anymore bc of this error. I tried patiently until 5 times trying to log in and it still doesn't let me in. What's wrong with it? üò≠",Negative
"As a Persona Fan, This got me hyped. I love the gameplay a lot. Especially the Roguelite part (Metaverse). There's a bit problem tho. I think 5 skill slot for 4 member is hard to manage, it needs a change or tweak at least because some character might not get a skill and some of them even got a very bland basic attack. But so far I love the game, for the first time I love the hoyoverse MC because man.. those animation and the outfit looks very cool.",Positive
"This game requires a huge storage available to run smoothly. Despite I have the recommended specs for my phone and lower the graphics, the cutscene and dub often lags. But the game overall is fun, fresh, and casual with auto-battle feature. Highly reccommended for turn-based RPG fan and cheesy, cringey (in a good way) humor fan.",Positive
"it's just AMAZING, as Hi3 player I can say this is amazing, I absolutely love the references to Hi3 in here and I get goosebumps each time they happen. Even if I'm not really fond of Turned Based games, this one just pays up for it with it's story telling and various events and small exploration, it doesn't really have 100% open world (you can't even jump üíÄ) but it's enough to please me, characters are amazing and graphics are just great. Penacony was amazing, can't wait to visit more Planets.",Positive
"The story is boring, characters's movements while talking are rigid, we need skip button",Negative
"There's a concerning lack of skin tones variations, specially in Penacony which is supposed to be based on the jazz age btw, and has references to slavery in one of the few dark skinned characters' skills names, truly disappointing",Negative
"Relic farming and rolling is stupid and repetitive. Not to mention how it ALWAYS, SO SKILLFULLY dodges rolling into crits. Def% nd flat defence feels weighted. Idk if it's bad luck or rigged RNG I hate it",Negative
"Moc is rigged as hell, enemies target low hp allies and is way too tough compared to previous mocs. The endgame content is also nearly impossible for a f2p player and luck factor or relics is too unfair.",Negative
"Giving it a 4 star even so.. please fix the log in problem,.""Too many, request please try again later"" I really want to play the game.",Positive
This game is amazing. It has a lot of amazing stories and also the characther designs are all spectacular,Positive
"Well first of all, the game is great! I like it very much, but let me make this a lot more short. I think theres a but sometimes when you enter a cut scene, the game screen will freeze. I don't know the reason, i tried the lowest setting possible and it still freeze sometimes. It's not that i am using a low end phone but i hope you fix this bug soon. Lowering it down to 3 stars for now, I think the bug on mobile keeps getting worse. The bug where in when you interact with NPC. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ",Negative
"An amazing game, I just really really wish it was avalible on the PS4 it is on the PS5 but I think the majority of people still have the PS4.",Positive
"So far, there are not very many story missions in the game, but this is normal, because the game is new. As a Genshin veteran, I remember very well what happened to it when this game appeared in the public domain. Guys, just wait for new content to come out. Devs very well done, the graphics and characters are wonderful. Interesting game mechanics, turn-based battles, the game is very generous for beginners.",Positive
"Absolutely love it, even for the arts, animation, storyline, and gameplay are all to my liking.",Positive
"I was able to play just fine one week ago, and never encountered any issues. But yesterday, ‚ÄúToo many requests, try again later‚Äú popped up. I was about to send an email to the contact service of hsr, but my brother told me that it won't help. He also had the same issue, and the contact service said that they can't help. I don't know what to do, it was my only account and its hard to start all over again.",Negative
"Love the game. Stories are soo good. Stories takes time but that is the fun part, because u don't get board and it's interesting",Positive
"It's fun to play tbh, not only there's many useful features but also the gameplay and lore is unique but sometimes it gets boring when you finished all the quests, overall it's a fun gacha game, and good rewards too",Positive
"I love this game to the bottom of my heart,but their is one thing missing during this whole experience. That is, implementing compatability with the rg405v. Additionally if this could be something implemented as well into genshin impact.",Positive
Love it. Love the characters and the music and the story and i adore caelus so much.,Positive
"An amazing game, the story is incredible and there is so much to do, it in annoying how you can't get the character that you want from time to time but it's still an amazing game!",Positive
"Quickly gets boring and repetitive. Has autoplay, which incentivizes making team comps optimized for afk farming, so you can let the game play itself. Once you get good characters, you can bruteforce any challenge on auto, no strategy involved. There is no open world and thus no fun in exploration. Locations are small and separated with loading screens. There are much better turn based mobile gachas on the market.",Negative
"the game is overall very good but i would like to suggest to make a change, so when i try to log in each day, the game shows ""log in error try again"" and i have to do log in twice to get in the game. i have read other reviews and they seem to have the same problem too. i would really really love if u make this change, overall an amazing game 10/10",Positive
"The GACHA game is nearly flawless‚Äîgenerous, with easy events, engaging game modes, a compelling story, and impressive graphics. The character design is top-notch. While I acknowledge that farming and gathering relics can be time-consuming, it poses a challenge for players with busy jobs. Introducing skip tickets could greatly benefit those with limited playtime. I just feel like that'd would speed up the game a little and still keep the players since story is amazing. Haha üôÇ",Positive
"First I was turned off due to me having a sub par experience with Genshin Impact. However I feel this game feels a lot more like a full fledged game and I felt it's easier to ignore the ""mobile game"" aspects. Dailies don't feel like a chore and the story progresses in a very linear way so that I hardly ever have to go out of my way to grind a lot. Apart from that the focus on instances makes it feel more alive than an open world and the turn based combat makes for more rewarding experiences.",Positive
"Some people negatively review this game as it is turn-based and is not as open-world as Genshin, but for me, it's the opposite. Genshin was too much for me, I didn't last two days on it, but I really enjoyed Honkai. It's open-world enough to explore but not too much for me to get overwhelmed. The combat game still needs some improvement, but I like it better than Genshin. The puzzles and the quests are also quite entertaining.",Positive
"Literally one of the best games I've ever played, the character designs, story line, and the battles are so good and entertaining. I had doubts at first especially with the turning based mechanic for the fights since it could easily get boring but so far yada! I highly recommend for people who also aren't competitive when it comes to games since its a more laid back system and you can go in your own pace :)) Update: LEVEL 70 AND STILL PLAYING LESGOO! Bangers after bangers each update goes crazy",Positive
"i really like the animation and story, but i keep getting this login error today. i played it yesterday, and nothing's wrong. i still have enough storage, and the wifi connection has no problem when i tried to play genshin or use other apps. i've tried several ways to fix it, but nothing works. i will change this review after the issue is fixed.",Positive
"Being a F2P player is hard you have to actually collect the jades just to wrap and have the chance to Warp. However I experienced warping but then it suddenly disconnected making my jades gone and disappear. My hardwork is gone. Btw its a very good game with good story! Totally recommend it, also it's storage friendly for me as a android user.",Positive
"For some reason when starting the game, there is a error login keep coming up. My wifi should be fine but no idea why",Positive
"The design for turn-based combat (aka animation, character position, the menus telling you enough information to plan ahead) is very well done, the combat itself has insufficient options to strategize. You can either do the basic attack or a skill with each character until you have the ultimate, there's no third active option to make you think a little bit more, not even a pass.",Negative
I love this game but it's now larger than genshin consumes 24 g against genshins 17.99 g please reduce the gigs this app consumes or I'll have to discontinue playing it coz I'm on mobile and has limited storage space. Thnx,Negative
"The graphics are stunning and the story is good. Surprisingly in depth battle mechanics. Lots of fun little things to find around the various worlds. On top of that the Dev support is amazing. All that said, I could not care less about grinding which in turn results in struggling to progress.",Negative
"This game is amazing and I've been looking forward to playing it since the announcement of the launch. The characters and the design are amazing. The storyline is intriguing and I like the humor. But I've encountered some problems so I ah ent been able to play the game as much as I like, the display on my screen would glitch and due to that, I am unable to press/tap some buttons, some times the audio would be late as well. The game itself is amazing but there are still some issues that persists.",Negative
"This game is awesome! I'm a casual player and still get to enjoy the game. Is quite F2P friendly, if u save your crystal and they have good pity system. Stunning artwork and to me, awesome story with super hilarious dialogue choice. While the game has auto battle (u can choose not to use auto), some story boss/elite will need u to fight manually, which increase its story immersion! Recommended if u are into turn based combat.",Positive
"genshin impact and honkai aren't the same in anyway shape of form, star rail is a turn-based game and its more modern related game, up to date with technology, there's a good range of characters to collect and build to see high damage, there's a bit of gambling for you addicts, theres beautiful scenery etc. Genuinely I think overall its a good game, but the only down side is the storage and gb it uses, I think it needs to be added on ps4, xbox etc. Because my phone isn't surviving right now",Positive
The animation keep lagging and the map also is lagging (no floor and some buildings gone) I'm so disappointed pls fix the bug‚òπÔ∏è,Negative
"Best graphic, immersive story, the characters are good and not bland. I was a veteran player for both honkai 3rd, genshin impact, and other related games but this one rarely makes me burnout. Altho if i went on hiatus for awhile, i'll come back to play it because of how fun it is. The 'return back' reward is not bad and the quests arent overwhelming but not boring too. Its a good balance, i'd say!",Positive
"Nice, easy, light on the device. Need faster and more main story telling.",Positive
"I like a lot of the game, however, I'm having a real hard time with crashing and lagging problems. I'm a mobile player and I didn't use to have this problem playing Genshin Impact, albeit, when it comes to honkai... it gets really annoying. For example, putting the lagging aside, in a day of gameplay the game crashed two times. Please, I would be happy if these problems are fixed.",Positive
"Great game, I usually play on PC though. I enjoy the turn based system and how you can take your time. Belobog felt like the beginning of every other game but so far Penacony is a great story. I love the characters and building horrible teams. I don't do endgame content so I can't comment on that. Now my issues, it's a gacha game, don't expect it to be f2p friendly. Once again laggy, but I only see that issue on mobile. Random difficulty curves. And artifact rng sucks. Those are my issues.",Positive
"Honkai Star Rail impresses with its stunning character designs, beautiful worlds, and engaging turn-based combat. It offers familiar systems for Genshin Impact players while being enjoyable without relying on the gacha system. A must-play for sci-fi RPG fans, showcasing Hoyoverse/Mihoyo's excellence in game design and storytelling.",Positive
"So I think there's a bug or something, My screen seems to freeze when I enter the pinball machine in the emoscaoe of melancholy, though when I press there still ingame sounds, My phone isn't really the problem cause I can run it with 60 fps no problem",Negative
the story's good and everything but for real please fix the graphic settings because no matter how much I am trying to make my graphics low it's still so glitchy... it's operable in my phone but sometimes it crashes when I'm logging into the game... genshin is friendly with the low resolution but not this game :'(( please make the low settings smoother for the experience (my eyes are straining so much I can't even have the heart to play the game itself hue),Negative
"I feel like I'm in an anime. The story alone earns it a 5 star, the execution feels perfect. I'm writing this after the Cocolia fight, the 2 phases of the boss fight, the change in music after the power up, and all the built up tension made for a perfect finale, along with the funny side quests and interactibles made it feel like I'm in an anime, very familiar to me to the Tales series as well. The turn based combat lets the characters' abilities, animations and the music to shine through.",Positive
"The game is exciting and unexpectedly ran smoothly on my phone. By the way, just a suggestion... If you could add a filter on the selection for ""Support Unit"" from friends/stranger. For example, The Hunt, Abundance and etc class. The reason why I suggested this is because I can't seem to find the support unit I wanted until I refresh for a few times. (Friend list filled with Seele). Please consider adding it. Thanks.",Positive
"This is really really recommended by me. The story's great, the dialogues are funny, and I especially like to find the treasures. I just keep getting the bugsüòî everytime I wanna play, I had to redo the log in steps about 3 times, and when fighting sometimes there's lags and discolouration... all in all it's really goodüëåüèª",Positive
a great game! started playing since the launch. if you're looking for a good turn based gacha game this might be one depending on what you like!,Positive
"I waited for this game and playes it the first day it came out, for someone who loves genshin and hated turn based fighting, this game made it much more fun with if's great animations. The gacha sistem is great and it's easy to get tickets ( much easier than in genshin at least ). One of the few thing i dislike is that we can't co-op, but still can make friends. Can't wait for 1.1 update and the new banners.",Positive
The game is bad when I log in my account it takes forever it's until sunday you need to fix this bug,Negative
Good story. Abit laggy if you have a weak computing software. I like the combat. Side missions are very fun and sometimes have really good story. The deduction/ cross examination game was really fun but abit easy.(won't go too much into detail cause spoilers.) Events stay for awhile which is good for me since I don't have much free time. Minigames are really fun.,Positive
"Great game overall except for the controls, well it isnt bad i just want it to be customizable. My tablet screen is really big so this makes the joystick really uncomfortable, especially that it is closer to the middle than the edge of the screen. My hands arent big so i have to really reach my thumb which is exhausting. I would like it to have a customizable controls in the settings, so that i can change their sizes and positions.",Positive
"Its a great free to play game where if you love characters, you'll definitely love the characters in this game.",Positive
"***Edit: I submitted a report with useful data and evidence to the Support team. Excellent service, quick responses, awesome people! The problem was fixed after a couple of patches. 5 stars well deserved.*** --- Old review: The game is pretty cool, I like it. But the android version does not work very well. I've been playing without sounds for almost a week because of a bug in the game. Also the game crashes very often.",Positive
"Used to be easy 4.5 or higher fantastic game, still play it on my PC then a new update came out and suddenly it doesn't work on my phone anymore it just keeps crashing i spent hours trying to get it working but I had to give up and the phone didn't change and was working fine before the update but after it's unplayable hence the score reflecting that. Using a Samsung s22 just for info.",Negative
"Interesting story, great graphics, organized combat system. But you have to wait like 5 minutes for it to download stuff onto your phone everytime you want to play it. If I wanted to sit down and make it a whole deal I'll hop on my PS5. Mobile games need to be more accessible and responsive than that.",Negative
Honestly I enjoy this game. Very little need for micro transactions which helps since most games I've played requires you to buy or else you can't progress üò≠,Positive
"The game looks really good and plays very well on my S21 FE but it does get really hot! I quite enjoy the turn based tactics on the game. In the beginning there is a lot to learn but one you get it, it's quite fun. Yes there is a battle pass to help you progress and play the game more. The story is good but has a lot of text to read, side quests can be a bit text heavy sometimes too. The game can be played for completely free but does have payed for elements. Characters are pulled on gatcha.",Positive
"Amazing game, good quality, no lagging, the storyline is amazing. There are many characters you can collect along the way and gain through quests and the story line and very easy to collect money and gain character tokens. Does take around 30 - 1 hr or maybe more to download depending on what device you're using and how much space you have, but I promise it is worth it.",Positive
"I am enjoying a lot of the game. I can tell a lot of care and attention has gone into it and the characters are really nicely done. There is something for everything here. I can't rate it 5* though as I feel the events are off-puttingly difficult. Edit- Dropping it to 3* because I am sick of the overly grindy, annoying, event blocking bosses that close off all the fun events to anyone who can whale for premium characters only. This is not a good look for the game and it isn't a fun design.",Negative
"Really good game, the only ""bad"" experience I've had so far is, for some reason, the cutscenes run extremely poorly. The sound is choppy and the visuals experience the worst lag on earth. I think it might be because of my device (Samsung S10+) but still. Apart from that, really good game, hope we get the Diting as companion soon enough though.",Positive
"Apart from some minor problems , this is the most well balanced game i've played untill now . Its very fantastic and pure brilliance. The lore and main story just keeps on getting better and better every update. Its becoming as equal to a story of any world class movie. The controls are easy. The relics are a bit tough but also thrilling. The very endgame content is a bit hard but u can complete most of the game with ease. Totally love it",Positive
"This game is so good. There's a lot of new elements that you can't find in the typical turn-based gacha games out there. The story is really good too plus the music is üî•! Progress gets slower the higher your level becomes but it's fine. There's so much to do when you ran out of energy, you can hunt chests, achievements, or grind your simulated world buffs. All in all a very great game! As expected of Hoyoverse! Oh! And I almost forgot, there's a ton of freebies for new players!",Positive
"Haven't played much of this game but I got addicted I love it so much, tho it gets boring I feel like its because of the scenery but that might just be because I'm a very low level, it's best when played in class tbh. Update like a year later, its hard to come back because theres a lot of stuff I have to do and its overwhelming but when I started playing again it was fun mainly only cuz of the character leveling and artifact farming as well as the main quests robin rlly got me attached",Positive
Love the game. But I think the credit cost of upgrades needs to be lowered. Or have a better passive way of obtaining credits without consuming TB power. Considering the jump of the amount of resources needed especially in late game just to upgrade 1 character the TB power amount is already staggering. Then you still need a lot more just to farm for credits is too much. It's like the devs do not want the players to have a fully upgraded character. Then you still need to farm for relics after.,Positive
"It's really fun RPG turned based game! The Gamelplay, storyline, Easter eggs, and the CHARACTERS!! are all amazing! Even there's bugs the bugs are too annoying either. I recommend playing this game if you're a lazy gamer like me!",Positive
its a good gane and all but please lessen the missions!,Positive
"Very good game, I love the characters, art, voice acting and story line. At first I wasnt sure about it since turn based games usually arent my thing, but the way they made it work is very enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing! Overall very happy about the game and enjoy playing it lots, though I dont enjoy how much space it can take up, especially on pc, but still would recomend to play it to anyone!",Positive
"The game's graphics are great, the artstyle is great, the rpg mechanics are okay. The only issue I have that got me bored playing this game is that you have to run around everywhere to complete missions and I used the teleport mechanics and it doesn't help make this game better in that perspective. I got bored of running around, this game needs more action.",Negative
"They add some few things like in boss fight most player are struggling for how hard a boss is like Aventurine, Sam, etc. They should add something like you can use other people's character for support or players can fight them in low like genshin impact.",Positive
"After having this game on my phone for months I finally bothered to sit out the downloads and restarts, and it wasn't worth it. High quality experience on paper but the writing, character design/visual style and voice acting had me cringing so hard I couldnt make it 10 minutes in before I had to quit.",Negative
"Its a very good game it also has good graphics. my only problem is, i can't see the floors and stairs. so when i got to the snow planet i got lost multiple times because I can't see the floors and the stairs, so i can't see where im going. So can you please fix this problem so i can play without getting lost every time. please and thank you.",Positive
"Great game! Love the story and sidequests along with the characters, along with the setting being space!! My only gripe, and the reason why it isn't five stars is that whenever I come back to it, it always asks to do download data. Maybe change it from happening all the time to once a month, and it'll earn that 5 star from me. Thank you for creating this awesome space rpg, hoyoverse, but I don't see the point of asking for downloads every time I boot up the game.",Positive
"i absolutely love this game, the devs are understanding and listen to feedback, the rewards are generous And the game itself has cute humour, totally recommend it!!",Positive
"The turn base system is more engaging and fun than I expected. And when I'm tired of the turn based grind, I can just use the autos. I've played all mihoyo games and this is the best one so far. Great characters, great story, great system. Abit hard sometimes because we need to upgrade but we don't have enough stamina thingy. I hope they'll be more generous in giving the items to fill stamina just like in HI3rd, since there's alot to grind.",Positive
I don't like how all the good skills got lock behind dupes it is impossible for f2p.,Negative
"I was not hyped at all as I didn't like the universe, character design and turn based combat at all based on the beta videos. I simply tried as it is from hoyoverse but it was a great decision. If you like single player rpg experience I highly recommend this game. Music, voice acting, story and the turn based combat are all great. GOTY for me so far.",Positive
I can't play on my laptop anymore after the 1.5 version update. I missed a day of login because of a stupid update...,Negative
Awesome gameplay and looks amazing but not fan of big stories where u have wait what feels like a eternity to play again lol makes me sleepy üò¥,Positive
My phone destroyed because of the game size reaches 20 gb and still din't add the delete past resources. Now I have to use my old phone cause of this...,Negative
P2W and very very little resources. It takes about a year to get one 5-star unit.,Negative
I love how it takes up more than 21GB's out of the 64GB's of storage I have on my phone.,Positive
Honestly 2.0 update was the bomb. Can't think of anything they can do to top that :((.,Positive
the loading is too long and I almost waited 4 in a half hours and I didn't even get to play it,Negative
Will not change until they roll out cross-server function to consoles.,Negative
This game is soo good love it so much.the only reason I rared it a 4 is because it takes longer time to load...,Positive
Stop time locking your events just release it all. I don't want to wait a full day just to do a little more. All at once please üôè,Positive
It's very nice the graphics are peak no bugs at all very nice game if you like rng based games,Positive
"Unable to login to using my twitter account, it takes me to twitter browing page when I try to authorize login. 1 year account is gone.",Negative
Mostly zero buz when I log in they turn the screen black and kick me out of the game,Negative
"Currently my favorite game. Penacony was so PEAK. Hopefully, the next arc will be as amazing or even more üíïüíïüíï",Positive
Not Free to play friendly. Need every limited banner unit to continue the story,Negative
Love it little lagging occasionally but that's bc I play on my phone! Have fun with this amazing game,Positive
"The most beautiful art of the cutscenes I ever seen. Loads very fast, characters not falling off the cliffs, attacking & moves are very cool, tradings or buyings are very fair, cool designed character and more. Huge success for the company. And also getting rewards and leveling up is so much easier than Genshin Impact. Bosses are kinda difficult but if you know the strategies and leveling up your characters it will do it. This is only my experience on my phone, so I'm not sure with othersüôÉ",Positive
I Love The Graphics And Gameplay Of The Game And also Fix Some Bugs. And Dev Have Some Rest,Positive
13GB update 2.3 it sucks as devs should provide features to delete past quests. Its already 35 GB in total for android. I m gonna quit if it extends more than that. HSR devs pls listen mobile players.,Positive
I like the game very much but there is this boss that is so unfair I can't continue my task,Negative
Very Nice but it's a game clearly for those who have money I take this back As an F2p damnn this is whole another lvl for gacha,Positive
Use to play it but stopped but when I started to play again it restarted me so good game but I think I'm done with it for now l.,Positive
Feels great. 9/10. Only thing I could ask for is a free 5 star choice,Positive
"The network not so stable I try to play at home but logout automatically At outside the network did,t close by itself",Positive
"An amazing generous game...! That's all, I can't professionally review a game after all",Positive
"So many bugs, specially when updating patch, wasting data so much...",Negative
Lame dancing characters. Playing off old Disney Mickey mouse gimmicks. Just gotten sad.,Negative
New update getting worst setup all always hsrd to get material to upgrade relic must go herta thats suck reward useless and gacha is trash scam open 70 times fire fly got nothing dont play this game need your money only pay and win haha this not free to play useless new update. sorry Wuthering Wave better gacha,Negative
Very fun to play because of the new mechanincs of gameplay,Positive
Really good game gives alot of wishes for gacha addiction and has a great gameplay storyline is also good,Positive
Best game I ever played in my life the story line the music ohhh it's soooooooooo GOOD I'm addicted to this game thanks hoyo for making this game,Positive
"after update I can't login on twitter (x), lost all progress",Negative
Better than other hoyoverse games.this game is good for mobile players that doesn't have fast hands like me lol and my luck in this game is just ü§åü§å,Positive
The game told me I'd get 80 free pulls but I got 20 but overall it's a good game,Positive
I love this game I'm from the old school RPGs but also play open world games üéÆüëç,Positive
"Fun, if a bit too focused on the grind.",Positive
Works well and has great graphics quality love the content ‚ò∫Ô∏è,Positive
Had to uninstall kept falling asleep mid-game and the phone doesn't turn off AT ALL. Very inconvenient when I need to go out early for work and its charge at 30% IF I'm lucky and wake up 3 hours earlier. And 10% when I wake up just an hour earlier. Game is GOOD(three stars instead of one) but the falling asleep on it has been going on since January 2024 and I've had enough of going to work with a low battery phone.,Negative
"Great, polished turn-based game. Takes alot of mechanics from Genshin so if you've played that this will feel familiar. Character dialogue and interaction shines in this game, but the overall plot can be kinda... Meh. Rank 40 is where the resource grind starts and advancement slows down considerably. Right now the game doesn't have that much content, but hopefully like Genshin, it'll continue to grow into a massive world.",Positive
"This game is an absolute blast to play. The combat system, surprisingly deep for a turn-based game, keeps you engaged, and the exceptional story is accompanied by fantastic music. The graphics shine on mobile devices, and character designs are on par with other Hoyo games. This all-rounder offers a captivating original storyline, well-crafted characters, and a satisfying gacha experience with ample resources. The developers continue to enrich the game with new content, I wholeheartedly recommend",Positive
"I played this game since the day it came out. And I love it. I'm a strict ""free to play"" player and I never had the urge to pay for anything. I'm currently at LV 64 (70 is max) and the gameplay and graphics etc are awesome. I have every character I wanted and with every new mission or Event I save my jades for new banners. It's cool that we can explore the planets and everything and the turned battles are much more loved by me than the normal battles in Genshin impact. Its worth playing it.",Positive
"Great game. It's one of the few games on mobile that doesn't require players to make purchases in order to progress. This RPG has a good storyline, interesting characters and good graphics. This game can compete with the likes of Final Fantasy for consoles and PC. I highly recommend this game of you like turn based RPG and are a fan of Final Fantasy, Phantasy Star, etc. My pixel 7 runs the game with no issues on Android 14. I have no heat up like some people have experienced on other devices.",Positive
"The game is great and for me it provides fresh new gameplay since it's entirely a different playstyle compared to the other games. Lately I felt burntout with genshin and honkai so I was excitedly waiting for this, also I barely have time to play nowadays because of irl stuff. It's a really great game, but the main problem for me is the optimization and graphics, constant fps drops in the majority of my time playing. I sincerely hope that it gets fixed, I'll change my rating if it does.",Negative
"This game is fantastic! I love the graphics, cutscenes, story. People need to stop comparing this to Genshin, they are two different games. This game is more story based, more cutscenes with a lil splice of exploration unlike Genshin. There may be people who dislike the turn based mechanics but there are many who likes it as well. If people are hating on the game because of the turn based mechanic and whatnot, it's not the games' fault that it isn't specifically catered to your preference.",Positive
"The game design is really cool and the characters too. The gameplay is really comfortable for me, I'm playing Genshin Impact and there is the difference between these two games. Instead of normal combat fighting like in Genshin Impact, the characters have they own turn and the enemies also have their turns. For me, this game is relaxation.",Positive
"The same red flags for all of Mihoyo's gacha games: - 0.6% SSR rate (with a 0.3% feature rate and guarantee at 180 pulls) - Separate weapon gacha - Duplicate system for gacha pulls (not mandatory but it does make a difference) - RNG equipment - Powercreep on all new characters to make you want to spend $$$ - Low premium currency income. They only get away with this because of a higher production value. And yet to this day simple features like a ""skip dialogue"" button don't exist.",Negative
"I unexpectedly fell in love with this game. I was never into turn based RPGs, but as a Genshin Impact player, I decided to give one of Hoyoverse's new games a shot. And I loved it! The mechanics are easy to understand and get into, the music and graphics are remarkable, and the characters and story are loveable. I greatly recommend giving this one a try, either if you're a veteran turn based game enjoyer or new to the genre. Beware of the grinding, though ;)",Positive
"The game is good Edit: so the game is good, story is also okay, but please some SKIP feature( What I mean by SKIP button was as in the game, like it's every story quest) yeah I know the game already has a skip button but it only applies when you already finished the dialogue. I would consider changing it back to 5* when you add that.",Negative
"graphics are great, story progression is ok, and i love the bgm. character designs are eh though. it's not very diverse, i get it's a chinese game but considering its global market i expected at least more diversity in terms of character ethnicity (especially skin colour) and clothing design (esp for the women since almost all the xz women have the same design motifs). often times as well it's hard to farm for relics and materials. as f2p it's manageable but a bit difficult, an ok game i guess",Negative
"Amazing game, I really love it. The attention to detail make it feel really smooth and it seems like they put a lot of thought into everything, which makes it feel alive. However, new characters get released all the time, so if you don't plan on spending money it could be hard to keep up. Of course, if you plan well it's possible to get the things you want. The combat is simple yet good, and I like how each character brings something new to the table. This game has a lot to offer.",Positive
"For turn based rpg lovers, the graphics and designs are one of the best. The story is worth trying for even for non turnbased rpg lovers, the direction is very great, how stories play out and how music and bgms are played at the right moment. The game is somewhat balanced, grindy but still achievable.",Positive
"The character design can sometimes be amazing, but sometimes, some characters end up looking the same. The lack of diversity on color schemes for characters makes them hard to tell apart.. and not to mention the skintones... Based on your companies other games, it's apparent that you can design characters with darker skintones, but it's disappointing that you use it on everything except the playable characters.",Negative
"Another must own anime gacha game. Along with Punishing: Grey Raven and Honkai Impact. It's a massive file after update, and I need a better device than my Galaxy Tab A8. It's a wonderful game for anime weebs like me ü•¥. The story, visuals, and audio are all five-star quality. Zero gripes , nothing to nitpick about Hnkai: Star Rail. I look forward to getting a proper device to play this game. My mobile device played it on high graphic settings, but there was no more space left in my storage.",Positive
"Characters are well made, locations are great, but the gameplay goes stale, very stale, very quick. Also no one will shut up in combat. I would recommend starting on console first due to how complicated it is to connect console to your current account, in case you want to play on console and moble",Negative
"I'm a max level player and all my characters are maxed out including light cones and skills. Still cannot get passed certain bosses due to it's P2W nature where you needed an overly specific character to be in your team in order to win. Grinding for materials sucks. The story sucks when reaching Penacony, I mean, who in the right mind wanted to click a lot and forces the player to watch a funkin 2-3 hours cutscenes with no funkin SKIP Button! This becomes a disappointment of a game due to greed.",Negative
"Basically gambling when it come sto obtaining characters. It's fine if you get lucky. Not so much if you don't. I've lost way too many 50/50s to see this game as worthwhile anymore. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if the standard banner characters were good, but the vast majority are garbage. I will take my money elsewhere. If I had to estimate, I've probably spent around $1k on this game. Just not worth it. Roughly $3k on Genshin but at least I get what I pay for there.",Negative
"The best game ever, much better than genshin with boring and repetitive events and less rewards. The events and rewards even the maps are fun to explore and less complex to explore. The victory has the satisfactory over the roof. Keep the good work devs of HSR.",Positive
"Best mobile experience among the hoyoverse games due to the nature of turn based combat alleviating horrible touch controls. Story, characters, animation, music, and environment are all you expect from the hoyoverse polish and elegance. Gameplay is great. Turn based system has enough depth to keep me entertained. Great game with great potential to grow",Positive
It's fun at first but your kept waiting for the story to continue and battles are mainly for materials there's no level grind as you can't earn exp in fights and end game enemies get super annoying and tanky so if you don't need the matts then it's better just to run. You gain levels by exp tombs. Oh yea first part 2.0 is a cliffy I'd wait for the next part if you haven't started. Ending that way on major updates is a real put off and the dream kinda forgettable. Ty for placing Kafka in inv.,Negative
"The game was good, it gives you a wonderful experiences and the gameplay and gamestyle was easy. The stories are so interesting and the characters are beautiful that will make you continue playing it. I hope this game will have a Honkai Cloud same as genshin impact cloud. I played both but I quited Honkai since I have no storage left and my phone is not high end so I choosed genshin since genshin is mach more optimized.",Positive
"Hey!, I loves this game the story is good, but my phone is 5 years old, and I can't play it cuz it's going to lag alot. And recently I had to delete this game, cuz of storage, it was fun to play and I was sad when I had to delete this game. It was so fun but so laggy. Hell I even had a good time while it was lagging, the game is so diverse and alot of fun. Sadly I had to delete it üòï ( RIP honkai star rail, you will be missed )",Positive
"Very nice game. Good graphics and design for characters. Just wish there was a jump button and co-op mode, then it would be perfect. I love this game!",Positive
"I don't know where the bugs and glitches are coming from the other players but my experience has been smooth so far (both mobile and PC). The game's quite generous as well considering it's a standard gacha game, and the combat system is fluid. I also love the story and the maps. The only thing that it is missing is a co-op mode, just like Genshin. And also just like Genshin, NEVER ever put or implement any PvP content in this game or it'll destroy it.",Positive
"This is NOT a Mobile Game. This is a superb AAA Quality RPG Experience. Quality voice acting. Engaging Story with excellent plot hooks. The Music/Soundtrack is, honestly, mind-blowing. The Combat is easy to understand, with plenty of depth and strategy to not get stale. Character design & Animations are üî•üî•üî•. You do not need to spend a single penny to enjoy this game. If you enjoy Final Fantasy, Persona, Dragon Quest, or any other RPG - you will enjoy Star Rail",Positive
Great game . Amazing story . And good end game . And super fun to play if U are into turn based rpg s. And if U are not U will love turn based rpg s,Positive
I've always loved this game and it's one of my favorite it's really good after you pass belabog the story is very entertaining!,Positive
"I love it!! It's a great fun game, but it does take space in device your using, not a problem to me. It's a great game, I totally recommend it!",Positive
Very disappointed by the lack of diversity and variety in characters,Negative
The game is so hard üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° I literally have all traces leveled up and all my artifacts are great too and it's also the right element and I still can't beat the boss üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ please fix it Hoyoverse I really enjoyed genshin that's why I also played hsr and spent money üò≠ü•πüò≠ü•πüò≠,Negative
"A very fun game! It's one of the best gacha games I've ever played and I get hours of fun from it every day, my favorite part of the game is the simulated universe which is always a little different each time.",Positive
"The art style is nice, and so is the music, but overall, the gaming experience is pretty mediocre and boils down to constant fights and autoing. Gacha system isn't anything so special either. While I love the character design, their voices, stories, etc., I don't think this game is worth investing in, neither time nor money wise.",Negative
Been playing it since release and it's an awesome game. I love turn based combat games and the fighting mechanics in this game are fun and easy to understand while requiring you to think of strategies. It also includes puzzles that aren't too hard but still fun to solve. Another wonderful thing about the game is the characters. The models and art in this game are super detailed and you can definitely find your favourite type of character in there. Love this game <3,Positive
"Okay.. it has a pretty intriguing story and a loveable cast. Character designs are a hit or miss, maybe a little too complicated compared to Genshin(still character design). The stamina system feels pretty good. I enjoy having downtime after I run out of resin as the game gets too repetitive after like an hour or so, but it really gets me to return before my stamina comes back. I love the pity, the concept of beginner 5 stars(wish we had this in genshin for new players), and overall good game",Positive
"i really love the game. the style, concept and everything. what i love the most is the characters designs and voice characters are also a bonus. unfortunately i have to reinstall the games sometimes when theres a character i saw in teaser that i really want to pull. since its taking up the space too much üôèüèª so i rarely play it often. i hope you can optimise the storage for future updates",Positive
"Graphics good, gameplay good but something else are also missing like cancel burst when you don't like to continue the burst, there is no defend option like for example, when attacking enemy which have penalty there is no other option but to attack them (I'm talking bout DPS characters) Black screen after defeating elite enemy in sim universe is also annoying because they are tough for beginners. Gacha drop rate is bad, the chance you win in Promotional Character is not high. Release the PS5 ver",Negative
It's kinda fun but when I press start my screen becomes black and I tried restarting the app but it just keeps happening Like I can't even start the game pls fix this,Negative
"A very good game with a good story,but I had to uninstall the game due to some reasons and when I re installed it i was not able get my progress(completed the present story)back i was around level 40 with cool characters and i don't think I have the energy to complete again....maybe I'll continue again from start on my new phone when I get one.",Positive
"My favorite game I've played, definitely a better and more worth your time/money then genshin, I'm almost maxed out in levels in a month and half, it has an amazing storyline and I can't wait to receive more, I just wish there was a way to go co-op/multiplayer besides support characters and maybe don't put extremely hard bosses that the player has never faced before in story quests",Positive
"Amazing game! Played since release and the animation, the cutscene, the characters, The gacha is soooo good and there soo much more! I can tell there is more to come in this game! Thanks hoyoverse!",Positive
"I would've given this game 5 stars w/o thinking. It was the closest to turn based role play with romance options that I can find via mobile. I played this game for almost 2 years straight and invested a LOT LOT of time and money into it. However, the ONLY reason it is only getting 2 stars from me is bc the game's so big now that my phone couldn't handle even the updates anymore. I'm furious after all that time, energy, and money I put into it, and I had to uninstall it since I can't play it.",Negative
"I have only one problem here, and that is the backgrounds. It keeps glitching some part disappears.",Negative
Good game but consumes a ton of internet just to play the game...if u play for 1 hour it will 1 or 2 gb...soo please fix this...genshin impact doesn't consume that much internet on the other hand.,Negative
"Wow. This game feels totally different than any gatcha game ever. It's console quality in all its glory. The graphics, the story. The background for each beautifully crafted character. Even the trash cans have interesting stories to be found. The combat could be deeper but this game is not even a month old. Keep up the great work! Thanks.",Positive
"Amazing Game Good Graphics, Storyline, Maps, VAs ETC Good Job Devs.",Positive
"Honkai Star Rail is phenomenal! Stunning visuals, engaging combat, and a captivating story with well-developed characters. The soundtrack is mesmerizing, complementing the gameplay perfectly. I'm blown away by the depth and replay value. The developers have created a true masterpiece. The game is a must-play for action RPG fans, with a unique blend of style and substance. I can't wait to see what's next for this incredible game. At the end I will say it's the perfect game I've ever played. ‚ò∫",Positive
"I like this game, but sometimes there's this bug when I'm in the character menu and I'm switching relics, the screen goes blank with only the universe background. And when I click behind on android, it takes me to the regular play screen, but the UI just disappears. I have to restart the game every time this happens",Negative
"Hello, I'm currently enjoying the game very much and I love how detailed and smooth the animation (even though there are some lags). But ever since the new version 1.1 came out, I'm having a difficulty to log in as it keeps saying error 1001_3. I looked up for some ways to get through it, but none of them seems to work. Could you please look into that and fix it? That would be very grateful.",Negative
"I personally think this is better than genshin impact. I even enjoyed doing every single battle manually. There's just something very satisfying with the battle system (it's fairly simple but still need a strategic timing and thinking). The story is 10/10, even the hidden quest and the chat conversation is funny and not cringy at all! Up til now i still play f2p and it doesn't bother my progress at all. EDIT : PLZ GIVE ME GOOD LUCK ON GACHA HOYOVERSE T.T",Positive
"Player since ver. 1.0. I absolutely love this game, story makes me cry in a good way. Sick characters' play style and designs",Positive
Great game with great combat and great story but please turn down the rng madness a little bit some people have been farming relic for months and can't even get any good relic,Negative
"The rates are very bad. Gotta drop that in early. However, pretty much every character can be used. Some are clearly better than others, but with a bit of effort and grinding you can close the gap. Relics and light cones matter way more than the characters themselves. Gameplay is very good. Events have a lot of variety to them and the puzzles are fun. There's a lot of content to get through, which is great if you want a slow burn, but if you have 30m to play before work it might be too much",Positive
"I've played this since release and the QoL from 1.3 is super helpful. That's the first thing I mentioned because it's the most important imo. Anyways as for the game, the turn base system is actually super fun especially in SU where you can get your characters to do insane stuff with the path you chose. The story has been super engaging and also quite short. The only thing I would complain is the time it takes to complete main events, but that's a me problem because I have 5 accounts. Super fun",Positive
"Love it so far, just did not expect this to be turn-based. Edit: Just realized it might be better for the game to be turn-based for mobile gamers. The graphics are beautiful but might not run very smoothly on low-spec phones. Mine has decent specs but can only run the game smoothly at low graphic settings and it still makes my phone heat up. Anyway this is a really good game, it's like a cross b/w Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact. Thanks for bringing Himeko back üíï",Positive
"My favorite part is the philosophical and spiritual aspects you can experience in the game, a lot of interesting dialogues and conversations, excellent storyline and great ideas were invested into the game! Like any gacha game, the only thing keeping everything in suspense is acquiring resources with limited trailblaze power for f2p. So far, it's acceptable considering how the game works, so it's not really something to be offset about, that's just how the game works, it just is. Excellent game!",Positive
"I liked this so much cuz it's like the best game I've ever played!!! üëèüòç‚ù§Ô∏èAnyways, the characters are also very cool and realistic too!!!",Positive
"The game is pretty good, the graphics are so beautiful and it doesn't lag on my potato phone but there is this one problem that is very annoying. When I try to play the game it just keeps putting me back to my home screen over and over again until I restarted my phone, miraculously it works!, For a few hours. Then when I want to play the game again it happens...again!! I don't know if it's the storage location(its in my SD because I have no more storageüòÇ) or its some glitch but pls fix!",Negative
"Idk where to report a bug, so I'm putting it here. I'm not sure if it's a bailu thing, but occasionally, when using her ult, it freezes the game, and then after a while, it makes the screen go black. I don't mind it much because restarting the game seems to fix it, but still, it's a little annoying.",Negative
"Very polished, simple base mechanics yet can be engaging and challenging even, characters are well designed, dialogues interactions humor and overall direction is a general step-up even from their other IPs. As long as you don't have intense dislike of turn-based and you're not someone who shouldn't touch anything with gambling at all, this one is an easy recommend.",Positive
"Best gacha game ever, very free2play friendly, Peak storyline, nice and smooth gameplay experience even on low end devices. Definitely my one of the most fav game of all time!",Positive
"This game is amazing,but like any hoyoverse game on an OPPO 16S, it is unplayable and laggy but i have seen many gameplays of this game and i cant blame the devs for my choice of device and it deserves a 5 star or 4 star at the least. I can't play anymore because the texture glitches and dissapears, the whole experience is laggy after the new updates and the game was way more normal in the pre-register version. Sadly,the lag makes me unable to play the game but i can watch videos of the storyig",Positive
"I love the gameplay, graphics, character design, the cast and the storyline! I love the funny content it has, even it would be dark at times, but things become light again! Honkai Star rail is the only Hoyo game on my phone. Because genshin Impact is devouring my phone so I deleted it. When I first saw the game I wanted Geppie(Gepard). I never really had any glitches but one of them is logging in, switching servers and being kicked out. But it rarely happens now. Thank you for reading!",Positive
Absolutely love this game and I love how it's connected to the other games as well. Hoyoverse is really good at making multiverse games and I really enjoy it. The story and everything is really cool. Though I don't like the combat system. I prefer an open world combat system but it's okay I guess. I look forward to the updates.,Positive
"This game is pretty amazing and the best part is that it's free! Amazing visuals, awesome music, fun events...It's pretty great!",Positive
"PLEASE NERF THE NEW SUNDAY BOSS I HAVE BEEN STUCK ON IT SINCE I GOT THE QUESTüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ ITS SO HARD (I tried my best building but it's difficult, please nerf the boss so it can be beatable at least)",Negative
"The game is absolutely great, the gameplay, story line, characters, fighting style, all which I absolutely love. But the constant crash mid game of something about the ""Global Error."" Or ""login failed"" is so constant that for more than a day I am unable to stay on game for more than five minutes or unable to enter at all! Please fix this bug.",Negative
"Another great game from Hoyoverse. Best Amime style art , music, characters, story you can find in game. I like it so far. Well you can't jump and gild here like Genshin. And something bit disappointed that you can't play with friends like Genshin. You can use your friends character. But you can't play with them. So overall great game to play solo. I would give 5 star rating if we can play with friends.",Positive
"Unplayable. Crashes every 2 seconds, doesn't load, freezes, etc.",Negative
"It's a very fun and f2p friendly game,my only issue is that it crashes a lot,I'm always getting ""error 10013 log in error""",Positive
"What makes up for its fun characters that offers a well written story and worldbuilding unfortunately loses its strength on the concept of turn-based games, which clearly shows to have a massive potential that could improve more than its current basic combat with lackluster skillsets and strategies. Yet with the companion missions that makes you appreciate the story and love those characters more, those several hours wasted on grinding through boring combat is still a time well spent.",Negative
"The game is good, i like the plot and references added in the game. Animations are quite cool too but you can improve those animation when theyre not in a cutscene. Some stuff are challenging yet fun and I like the concept of other playable characters being a boss. Anyways, They're still a lot more for improvement and hopefully this game bloom good like its sister games.",Positive
Game freezes a lot on startup. It just stays on the loading screen until I have to close the app and restart it. I hope they fix this soon.,Negative
"well, the rewards never fail to impress me, and the characters are all good as well. and i hope you'll keep your game being like this, because i know genshin impact could never, hahahahaha.",Positive
This is one of the best mobile games I've played to date. The turn-based combat makes it easy to use on mobile. Numerous rewards for gachas. 100% suggested.,Positive
"You know what's fun about this game! Is the challenge. To become stronger to defeat many bosses. F2PüçÄüçÄüçÄ If you just P2W to get on top there's no fun in that. But use your money however you like to support the game ,ü´†ü´†‚ô•Ô∏è",Positive
"After playing the game since the release, I can firmly say that this game is a huge waste of time for ppl who don't grind for multiple hours a day, dont win a large prize from lotteries or casinos every month, or dont have enough money to slam down money for every single warp event",Negative
"This game is terribly boring. I followed the tutorial and basically die cos I can't beat the early enemies. What kind of dumb progression is that. In only playing this garbage have to get gems in my real game, but it's so boring I'll just delete it. Graphics are outstanding though. Shame.",Negative
Big world lots of customization options. But the story is so long and detailed. I want to play a game not read a novel every time I play.,Negative
"fps drops significantly sometimes in cutscenes everything else is just amazing fluid UI amazing character designs new characters story progression i love this game alot and has replaced genshin as my favorite game i would say genshins core combat gameplay is more fun obv but as a whole, honkai star rail is much better and enjoyable",Positive
I was interested in the game since it's gotten viral so I decided to try it but the problem here is after I click play the game will not load it's only a black screen and later on it crashes I would give this game a better review if I could just play it,Negative
"So I got a new device. And it seems like it was device issue where it couldn't process the texture properly, it performs decently in lowest or low settings, choppy frames but atleast it's playable. Good game and very f2p",Positive
"Game is so laggy at the film minigame *specifically* that I can't do anything but look at the hamster hit things, hitting the button does NOTHING meaning that I can't progress the main story, thanks a lot.",Negative
"Lovely character designs, vibrant world and beautiful music. Boring endgame, needs more varieties and new contents at faster release pace.",Negative
"A Pretty much FGO, Genshin Impact, and Honkai Impact combined. Not much to say, it is just classic turn based game with little touch of open-world (Explore to get chests and reward).",Positive
Rating update. As a returned player I'm grinding stellar jade so hard to get some character but when I summon it get me to hard pity and then the worst part I lost in 50/50 and now I think this is the last time I give a chance on this game.,Negative
I absolutely hate the trashcan quest in penacony or smth i hope yall can make it less powerful because i can't continue and i tried my best to build my character. i will give this game a 5 star if you guys can at least make it beatable. the trashcan makes me so angry and frustrated so i hope you guys can make it durable.,Negative
I was pretty excited to try and play hsr for the first time but then after I played and do quests the update got downloaded I exited the game and come back but then when I start the game it is a black screen I waited for hours nothing happened please fix it,Negative
"Fun game, needs more interactions with friends like rewards and friendship meters for using them more frequently, same with in game characters.",Positive
"I like this game so far, easy to understand, so many events, and awesome story! I had struggle when i wanna login tho sometimes, but it's fine i just need to reload.",Positive
Happy Anniversary üéâ I have play this game on my phone and my laptop since the game launch and I love the way of this development of game. The storyline is top notch plus the unseriusness stuff that they put in. The asthethic and character develop is marvelous. Keep up the good work Hoyoverse üî•,Positive
"No controller support for backbone, but for Xbox Controller. Everybody gonna use Backbone more than the Xbox Controller on Mobile since Backbone is more convenient.",Negative
Very nice game and works perfectly on all my device. Wished it has consistent support for controllers across all platforms Request: Can you please add wired controller support for this game in Android?,Positive
"Already uninstalled and installed it back...it was good a few minutes ago and now when I played it again ,it went black screen...why are you wasting my phone internet like that!? I will uninstalled and never played again! Still no fix in my favour so goodbye honkai üò∂",Negative
"Farming artifacts is even worse than genshin since the drops are just as bad but since there's no such thing as an ""off-set"" you need to get 6 artifacts that are of the set that you want instead of just 4 in genshin, crit and elemental damage farming hell and all.",Negative
"Coming from someone, who isn't the biggest fan of Sci-Fi, this game has an immersive world you just want to explore, but it feels more linear than open world games and therefore can get boring fast. Turn-based combat is actually very fun and straightforward. The characters have a more complex personality in comparison to Genshin Impact. Of course their designs and voice acting are topnotch! Take your time and don't rush, there is not a lot to do if you are caught up in the story and have to wait",Positive
I dont know why the downloading process is so annoying! I've done it and playing but suddenly it got me out of game. Now its almost a week im trying to play it again but i failed!,Negative
I had a warp bug but now I can rate five stars because the rewards got to me and the bug resolved it self after I completely shut the game and opened it again fun adventure game for all I really recommend it,Positive
"The best gacha game ever... Update, I'm having an annoyance problem in game that often happened when the game loading in the title screen, after battle, the game will stuck or lost server. It happened really often that I'm feeling depressed right now. Maybe it is because of the server overload but, please fix this immediately or else I will quit game.",Positive
"I used to 5 star this game. But then 2 starred thinking how they keep powercreeping everything but after I found out that my very first 5 star (the first that came out seele) can still do very well in endgame, I'm 5 starring again.",Positive
"I've played this game on my pc, and it was so good. Now i try to install it on my phone, and it crashes on downloading upldate page, and because of that, i can not play the game.",Positive
boring gameplay + no skip button and they want you to gacha for almost every character equals game if you enjoy story telling games this one is for you. sometimes game just black screen and need to reopened(already black screen like 3 times until the 1st boss fight) data storage also bit heavy (16 gb ++),Negative
There's really nothing wrong about this game I absolutely love it. I've played since launch and I am amazed about how much this game has grew and how many awesome characters we have,Positive
"hi, my game crashes when my gepard activates his ultimate. this is a fairly new issue for me since ive played this game since last year and encountered no problems of the sort before",Negative
"Very awesome game I love it especially the characters, storyline and the combat. The graphics are good and the quality is good",Positive
"This game have all u want from a turn based game. This game is so f2p player friendly, I am playing this game for 70 days and I alredy have 5 5‚òÖ characters(I am super unlucky). U just need patience of saving and u will enjoy this game. Material farming is hardüò≠",Positive
Weighted stats on gear is disgusting and scummy practice. The game puts weight on the important stats you need in the game and actually manipulates rng to keep you artificially playing longer. Don't play this game.,Negative
"It's a really good game so far for someone on a phone but I do have to ask, will Honkai be coming to PS4 because as someone who doesn't have a PS5 I'd really love to play it on a console.",Positive
"The graphic good, sound good, intresting take on story Gameplay: not better than other turn base RPGs it has less mechanics, no PVP(no competitive mode at all) fully single play. Still better than Genshin tho.",Negative
"Please Nerf the newest boss I can't get pass it since it's very very tanky and it deals so much damage, I've tired 30 times already and still I couldn't bet it my characters are already have a good build and yet I keep losing. Please nerf the new boss",Negative
"I don't recommend this to kids since you need money to have a good time, and the luck to summon good characters is bad, and since you need good characters for most of the battles, you are more likely to be stuck on a lot of them for almost a month or more.",Negative
"Didn't get Black Swan! Well nonetheless besides that I like the game a lot but I feel burnout after so long trying to get enough crystals to pull for her, so I guess I'll take an undefined rest of it. But as I said, the game is good. Good narrative, interesting characters and also the animations and music are good. Truly a masterpiece but the gacha system is seriously a double-edge sword. And oh yeah even tho I didn't get her I still believe that genshin could never.",Negative
"One of the best game I ever play... Great gameplay, the story per patch is amazing.. Amazing quests and greatest of all is free to play friendly game... Really appreciate those who support this game...",Positive
The graphics are amazing and it's not much storage. The character designs are amazing just some are iffy,Positive
"The only problem for me is i just started play this game on first day this game available for PlayStation 5. It's mean i missed a ""Starhunt Game"" event and didn't get the light cone ""Before The Tutorial Mission Starts"". Will this event get a rerun for a new player like us?",Positive
"Game is good but why can't I start the game? I haven't played in a while, when I did, I opened the app and it just kept me in the update screen, it failed two times now...",Positive
"Didn't want to play another Mihiyo game but was persuaded by my co-workers. They said ""Character pulls are generous"" and that ""This game is so good trust me"" should've known. This game would've been way better if it weren't a turn based game. Absolutely 0 Emerson. Its boring af and character drops aren't generous at all. I gave Raiden banner the final chance at this game. Didn't get her out of 60 pulls saved up and given. Uninstalling and never looking back. Won't trust Mihoyo ever again.",Negative
"Horrible experience logged in issues, your too strict on this one.... please fix this issue where some of us can't logged in when we only log in 1 account it always says ""too many requests"" bad system",Negative
"was super happy about the game, but the racism is insane. hate that ""sparkle"" entity so much. its not a heavy topic or whatever, i love heavy topics but this game is so bad at presenting it. especially with the terrible, racist first impressions. i cant even believe what i was reading and hearing in the dialogue of sparkle's first introduction. i also couldnt believe that real romani slurs were intact in the story. slurs? really? does a good heavy topic about racism has to include slurs, too?",Negative
"This game makes me feel like gaming again. I don't know why, recently I just didn't find any fun in gaming. That is until I tried this game and got hooked. It reminds me of the wonder of gaming from when I first tried it.",Positive
Game crashing when loading patch regardless of changing graphics settings otherwise good game I'll probably be sticking to console if keeps crashing,Negative
"I am actually amazed that still now I keep on playing Honkai Star Rail. I can't explain anymore how I love this game. HSR creators really love all players is like he/she knows what we want ,what we like. Almost 1 year now this is the first game I actually stay until a year later. Thank you for creating a wonderful game,, God bless you guys always..",Positive
It's been a whole year and I'm still playing this game. That's way longer and more consistent than any other phone game. I'm a F2P and I feel fully engaged in the content. This is a legitimately good game.,Positive
"The character designs are so cute!! The animations are also really smooth and creative. The story is interesting, and their mouths move smoothly while talking, the face expressions and movements are also smooth and wide. But it can lag a bit, because the app is new and really big. But overall awesome game! 5 stars for now <3 edit: the story is getting kind of boring, and no co-op so dropped to 4stars, overall still great :D",Positive
"I used to hate turn based games until I tried this one. This is honestly one of the best games I've ever played. The characters, story and music are all fantastic.",Positive
"12GB update? You should optimize the downloading screen since at 15% of the download gaming phones overheats and crash, that train animation consume much power while waiting for the download to complete. Time to uninstall on my phone",Negative
I like this game but can't skip the conversation is annoying it talk im not much a story guy but just hope they make a skip button for people who don't really care about the story and just wanted to enjoy the game,Positive
When will Penacony end? This arc is so long and uninviting for me. üòÇCan't even skip dialogue and cut scenes. Some players don't actually like some storylines. Please consider.,Negative
It's a good game over all but the new boss fighr with Aventurine is ridiculous. For any hard fight its really not that free to play friendly and it really shows with Aventurine's fight.,Negative
"Gives few resources for draw, really long unskippable cutscenes, character design is the best thing going for it.",Positive
Best open world game I've ever played on mobile.I just wish they'd make the bosses a bit more easier to defeat and I that they'll make the game compatible for lower end devices.,Positive
I love this game so much it has brought so much joy into my life and I sometimes quit beforehand and get back on it because I'm happy when I'm playing this game it is just so much fun I love this game so highly recommend ‚ô•Ô∏è any who is looking for a game to play this year this is the best game of all time long Clement.,Positive
"Unfortunately the app crashes constantly, not only on mobile but PC as well. I love the game and I wish I could play it.",Negative
"First gacha I like. I play it on PC, console, and mobile now. Low commitment and still get great results. Plus the story is actually good.",Positive
"The story, lore and characters is one of the top reason why I play this game. Hoyoverse games never disappoints in providing a good gaming experience.",Positive
"I am using Snapdragon 439 to play HSR, so far other than graphic glitches, overall quality is good and above average, the game provides lots of Quality of Life as we players are an adult and cannot commit to the game on daily basis, it also has cross platform where we can login using different devices one at a time, the most appreciated effort are HSR team listened and bonded with player base, making the game progressive and dynamic, I may consider HSR as one of the best PvE game in 21st century",Positive
I like the game so far but it's has a stuttering issue and the environment like the ground and walls keep disappearing and appearing back again,Negative
"It is very difficult to level up characters. Without good characters from the banner, it is difficult to pass the main quest. rotten act to make the player spend real money in the game",Negative
My account got too many request please try again. I tried all method but nothing work. Others are fine too but this login problem is bad. I don't want to create another account and start all over again.,Negative
"Playing on Phone and PC, trying to enjoy the game everywhere. Unfortunately on my Samsung s23 Ultra after 6.1 update( phone update) I can no longer play , the game closes on installing patch step üò≠",Positive
"Is there a version of this that is actually a game? So far everytime I ""play"" it updates and then the app I found it through tells me I've upgraded a level. I have yet to see so much as a load screen for this game, which I no longer believe exists",Negative
the story is amazing and the gameplay is fun. i enjoyed the 2.1 tb quest im looking forward to the next installment.,Positive
Hi after updates most the animation starts to stutter. Cant even play it properly. Can you please solve this issue. So dissapointing. And im using S24plus for your info. Not some cheap phone. Please rectify this. After the new update and area problems starts to come.,Negative
"I'm really happy Hoyoverse (miHoyo) made an outstanding new free game for us. I'm into Turn-Based games, and the Ultimate of each character is astonishing. I keep winning the 50/50 üòÇ (thx Hoyo)",Positive
"Okay....this game is Fantastic,the character design,map,story,and other stuff it's straight up fantastic but I still hope you guys add a jump button 'cuz for a man like me I..like shortcuts üòÇ.and also the Lag when I put my graphics to highest... please improve it a bit too 'cuz everyone wants to experience this game at full graphics and lastly add like a trail when walking to snow or sand 'cuz why not...overall this game is so unique for me that's why I love it!",Positive
"Very great and the devs are so generous with the rewards! The story also fun, I love the mc personality and their friends. Keep going!",Positive
"the update was good, I think that you should try to put a special calyx crimson the resins is to many ways in stead ,one like gold calyx it gives you the same item with uncommon, I thought you could do the same.",Negative
"We should be able to access settings during cutscenes or conversations. I sometimes turn off the sound during missions to put music and forget to turn it back on for dialogue. Another great add could be better daily rewards logins? I feel like the last three rewards are a bit underwhelming. Aside from that, adding another team identical to the one last used for events could be nice (ex : So you don't have to remember which teams were used for which caverns)",Positive
"I LOVE THIS GAME, ITS FUNNY AND IT HAVE MANY REFERENCES. THE LORE IS DEEP AND ITS FUN TO LEARN. THE CHARACTERS ARE WRITTEN WELL TOO, THEY ALSO HAVE GREAT DESIGNS AND ALSO DON'T FORGET THW GRAPHICS ITS MADE VERY WELL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE GAME",Positive
Worst. Game. Ever. It sucks. It just sucks. How can a game with gameplay this bad even exist? I only downloaded it for that mistplay thing but this is pure Is torture. How can you advance when the best you can get is characters with only hal-desent attacks that barely do any damage?,Negative
"Music is 10/10 Story starts as a 7/10, goes to a 4/10, and then in the most recent story mission, makes you cry 10/10. Combat can be confusing but is overall fun.",Positive
"The opposite of Genshin Impact. Hoyovers has worked and cared a lot on Honkai Star Rail Even the rewards of the game are a hundred times better than genshin I won three banners three characters in a row without any losses The gacha and pity game system is better than genshin .the new Update of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game, which has a very interesting story and And the story of the game is getting more and more interesting Each character has its own charms and has a very beautiful play style ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç",Positive
"I really, really, really love this game..... The problem got fixed thank you so much for your service and I'm looking forward for this games future updates. HAPPY 1ST ANNIVERSARY HONKAI: STAR RAIL",Positive
This game is amazing. The fact u can get so many characters the game play and places u can go as someone who mains houhou yanqing acheron and clara they r some of the best characters out their I'm excited for sundays release so I can pull for him,Positive
I have lots of fun playing the game. I love reading the stories of the game and of the players. The stories of your heroes too. I do recommended to the players like games.,Positive
"Hello Dev, can we have feature to ban 1 main stat and 2 substats from relics we got for each cavern of corrosion and/or SU to make relic farming easier ? like how we can ban 2 paths on each SU run. Thank You üôè",Positive
Changing my rate from 5 to 1 I hate how the story line taking place of the game. It's exagerately long. I'd rather watch movie than play read the story line.,Negative
"I have been playing on playstation and mobile when I travel, I really like the story and the worlds, I look forward to future updates",Positive
Game is extremely good and detailed. I love the story and the updates don't take to long. Oh and please re run on kafka that would be appreciated,Positive
so far its very entertaining. i love the characters design and the story line. waiting for the next update ! :),Positive
I heard great things I down loaded the game did the update then I have to download a 16 thousand mb. To play the game....no thank you. I can play a lot other games for that much room.,Negative
"Horrible customer service. I sent mail because I can't login my account and they ignored it. Not even a response from the mail. I still can't login my account now, thanks hoyo",Negative
Come dude least the tutorial less time consuming or make the first 5* not random but selective so we don't waste our time doing rerolls just to get BS character we don't want.,Negative
The game I played besides genshin. There is a coupon of genshin using 150 play point. I hope Starrail also have one. Then i can purchase monthly card with it.,Positive
The game is very good. May i suggest to add elements to the battle system like resonance or skill combo or something with sfx? Just an idea XD,Positive
"Why doesn't it continue? It says error code help, it started last night but before that I can play well, then I got in later in the morning but now I can't continue again, I can connect to other games well, please fix this, I really like Honkai Star Rail ü•≤",Positive
"An enjoyable single-player experience with clever interjections of modern memes, interesting character backstories and amazing musical score. Don't let other's gacha results worry you and enjoy the trailblaze!",Positive
I love the game and the design üòç‚ú® But my mostly favorite is their clothing designs man it's so fancy and their abilities really surprised me! Please update this more!!!!üòçüòç,Positive
I give it 3 I was going to give it 5 instead but I was downloading the 2nd download I started at 1.0 again pls make it be like genshin impact loading it didn't not started again or I like genshin impact instead of honkai star rail pls fix it so I like bothi started the at the 1st download I think I can play it now pls fix it pls,Negative
Flawless for me though rarely the opening screen kind of stops doing its thing and I have to reopen the game but it doesn't bother me much,Positive
Not an actual game. You download it and it sits at searching for updates. It's just a screen saver sorta thing. Really pointless.,Negative
"It is a good game not gonna lie. With this in mind; the game takes up way too much storage, at a whooping 34 gb. I physically do not have the storage on my phone to keep this game going.",Negative
I accidentally used Light Cone reward from Nameless to level up instead superimpose. This should be improved. Low rating until I recover.,Negative
One of the best Gacha game I play in a long time. Character design is good. Story is good. And the game give so many pull that I can play completely free.,Positive
Nothing changes the most texture isnt rendering the bug is still present. This is getting disappointing.,Negative
"Amazing game, helped a lot, and compared to genshin Impact, their anniversary rewards are amazing. Officially, it's my fav game.",Positive
I love this game (ik it takes up storage bit we don't talk about that) it's such a good experience especially Penacony I love the characters design world design graphics everything about it,Positive
This is the most friendly game honkai ever made. It easy to farm stellar jade which you can use to pull character. And best story and music.,Positive
"So I played genshin years ago and I wanted to start a brand new game I could actually fit on my phone as well computer so I started honkai I have been nothing but having such a great and awesome time. The story, characters, combat, writing, the trashcan lore ( one of my fav parts haha) it's a great game I would recommend to those who wanna step into a nice game turn based combat, lots of side quests and much more. And they are very generous as well with rewards which I appreciate! :)",Positive
"Love the story, music, character design, voice acting. This game checks all the boxes of a great game ‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
Let users change their equilibrium level. Not everyone plays it 24/7. Casual players just play it for a fixed amount of time.,Negative
Recommend to play casually and not worry too much about the end game content. Spend responsibly.,Positive
"Came for the future cowboy, stayed for the various dragon characters and beautiful traumatized men. Only downside is that they talk way too much.",Positive
"best story and animation, i like when story getting intense and sad at the same time, the villain was great especially in the Penacony, i love that 10/10",Positive
"Literally the best turn based and lore game ever! The writing, the music, the designs are all top notch!",Positive
"It's awesome! Everytime when a new version is released, I will be very enjoy about the new missions and the new characters!",Positive
"Game is peak tbh, character designs, personality, and animations are so good and its so fun, the Penacony story is insane",Positive
Game has been crashing often lately. On s24 ultra latest software update with game booster settings enabled minus the onscreen widget.,Negative
"Its a great game I love it, but i feel like it is not fully optimized for mobile unlike Genshin impact i always encounter frame drops but in Genshin I don't.",Positive
"Amazing game, but I have a recommendation, I've noticed that the (X1) speed is way to slow to the point that makes the game is unplayable, at the same time the (X2) speed is little bit fast to the point that made the animation kinda usless, And to be honest the majority of players wants to enjoy the animation with a reasonable speed, so if you consider making (X1.5) speed or at least speed tone the (X1) speed of the gameplay lil bit more would be amazing and appreciated üëåüèº",Positive
"I have been playing it for an almost a year, it's a great game! It loads pretty fast compared to other hoyoverse games. Animation is jaw dropping! I also love the voice acting in the game! However, sometimes it's hard to find the places you can obtain certain relics.",Positive
"my phone can handle this game smoothly. but cutscenes are laggy, especially on MediaTek Dimensity series devices.",Positive
"The graphics are pretty good and cool. The game was running smoothly and I had a lot of fun playing and the puzzles were so much fun and it made me use some brain power to figure it out. Lastly I love hoyoverses other game genshin impact but I would say that this was a better experience, but I love both games equally.",Positive
"Definitely some bugs are present. It kept crashing on me. But if it's fixed, I'll definitely give it 5 stars",Negative
Read this all five star reviews are paid for my mihoyo they aren't real the game is OK if u want to spend money if ur f2p u will have to choose wisely how to play as everything has a limit to grind or stuck on cause emiemes hit too hard and only way is to have summonable characters very little Iver 1 year ani terrible company and management of game,Negative
"the game was good and fine but there's so many bug need to be fixed . i can't move my character and when i clicked exit button, it didn't appear . also when i exited the game, the music is still there . there's also a bug where I can't see my character after i clicked the character details . the character is suddenly gone . but the attack button still there . i hope it can be fixed . thanks",Positive
"I've been waiting this to release and it was worth all the wait! The story is interesting, characters are cool and awesome, the open world also something else that gives me lots of excitement!, the gacha system is just fine, overall experience it's a 9/10. would be a 10/10 if there is no ""login error"" while trying to open the game anytime.",Positive
"Its a pretty cool game honestly, tysm for adding an unstuck button üî•üî•üî• your game is so kool",Positive
"So far so good, the gameplay is fluent, no lag at all. (if you experience lag, or your game crashes, you might have a weak phone, try lowering game graphics in settings, if the game doesn't load/crashes instantly check if your phone has at least 5 RAM). Loving the characters. Hopefully new stuff might come out in future updates, like : co-op, maybe even guilds etc.",Positive
Love this game but I hit a brick wall. I can't pass the lvl 5 to progress and I can't upgrade my stats without being lvl 5.,Negative
"I like the new gameplay it's different compared to other games released by hoyoverse. Which is good as it provides a fresh new gameplay. However, I do feel that after progressing to a certain part of the game there's not much to offer. As once players are done with the current storyline we would have to wait until the next update in order for the storyline to continue. This also means that eventually it can be quite boring in terms of storyline unless there are more in game events.",Negative
"For most the gameplay is smooth and performance good, i can play this one on my mobile than genshin so its a plus something i can finally play and its an rpg style so it easier to play kinda complicated and not at the same time so still good. It makes you think so you cant just have a one trick character team synergy is good so its great for experimenting other characters, and for the story i am getting hooked with the side missions or characters more here which is great.",Positive
"There is no need to rush type of game, suit me well. Also better rewards than genshin, although my gacha luck still bad in this game. Great game.",Positive
It keep force me out after aventurine talk to sparkle when i still have so much storage space left out and i cant complaint in game because when i rejoin it automatically start from the cutscene,Negative
"Great game Although, there is a bug(?) that whenever I use ultimates (in my experience gepard and silverwolf) my whole phone just freezes and I can't do anything for a bit then it just goes back to being normal. I've tried lowering my graphics and the problem is still there, this only happened in just this update. To add a bit more it only happens to me on calyx and artifact domains, any other content it works fine for me.",Positive
"Overall it is a great game; graphics, story, gameplay, voiceover, system, UI. The only problem is that it doesn't work well on my phone (Infinix Hot 10 Play) even tho its only 10Gb, it often says log in error- or the game just crashes on the title screen, which is kinda weird. Cause Genshin Impact has way more storage and more RAM to consume, yet it works fine on my phone. Probably this game isn't optimaized yet? To all devices such as mine, I hope you'll be able to fix this problem :<",Negative
I like the game. So far so good. It's turn-based and not open world but it has many features that are better than Genshin. Hoping for more unique characters to join. Edit: Sushang ultimate looks like a joke/underwhelming. Can she have a normal great ult? Especially as we're watching ults over and over and over and over and over and over again.,Positive
"The gameplay, art style, characters, rewards, are great, better than genshin lol. But a major problem for me while playing on my phone the cutscenes lag for no reason it's been a problem since the 1.3 update I don't really know how this problem occurred but I hope the devs could fix the laggy cutscenes this would've been a 5star review if it wasn't for the mentioned lag",Positive
"I was going to give this a five star, I've been really enjoying the game, the characters, the gameplay, art style, its lore and the world in it are amazing. But the only downside it's extremely laggy, as I couldn't properly enjoy cutscenes with its terrible cut outs and exploring the world glitches the scenes and make some parts of the game...transparent? Is the right word as the ground, buildings, and some items just don't appear on screen (I would send screenshots if I could) pls fix it",Negative
Nice to be back! I love the changes that you implemented (I stopped before Super Dan Heng release). Keep it up and more free pulls please!,Positive
"While I wish combat provided more options, HSR has surprising depth and building teams is significantly easier than in Genshin. Endgame actually exists, and the story is good but can be slow at times. My only gripes are that new characters can be hard to afford due to the release schedule, and that Simulated Universe runs could be sped up a lot.",Positive
"I have played and tried over 500 mobile games in the last 5+ years since the technology emerged and high quality games can be achieved - not specifically graphics but also immersion, replayabilty, mechanics that are easy to play but also hard to master. All in all I could not find a game that kept me as engaged ss Honoki. The universe is jaw dropping and the gameplay is on another level. Not in terms of complexity but in terms of how well it was thought. Kudos to the devs, from a dev. ü•∞",Positive
Loving the game and really enjoying my experience. The story is great so far and I really enjoy the characters.,Positive
"I have been playing this game for more than a week now and shelling $300+ already to pull, a few thoughts. Pros: Good graphic and artistic style. Quest storytelling is quite rich if you read subtitles. Lower star characters are powerful as well. If you are a layback player, you still able to play through stories and events. Cons: Incomplete storyline. The storyline will stop at about a week into this game. In general, rewards are poor, not matching the efforts. Not much to do after stories.",Positive
Best game that treats their player base with many suprising rewards and content. Keep it up Star Rail!! Keep moving starward!,Positive
Imagine if genshin had all this üíÄ. Ok jokes aside really good game graphics are A1 no doubt and the story is quite nice aswell and add more exploration and puzzles hoyo!,Positive
"Beautiful animations. Similar character design to genshin impact and a very engaging story line. The amount of resources given is sizeable although this is because we don't have a very wide roster of characters to build as of yet. The turn based combat forces strategic decisions when playing, unlike genshin where you can brute force your way through content if your carry is powerful. Overall a great experience and would recommend to others. Some QOL changes would be nice.",Positive
"I'll be honest the game is great although leveling system and difficulty could use a bit of tuning, however my point is I wish there were more ways for the characters to be more interactable and when I mean by that is that they need more interactions other than just answering questions I don't know how to put it but the characters lack life (outside of the story) having more interactions responses something to them cause everything is improved except the characters",Negative
"It's a good game, with good graphics and amazing burst designs however its just unplayable on my devices. It took up 14.5GB and I just updated it ONCE. I rate it 3 stars, its good but I had to delete it due to the amount of space this game takes up but overall I recommend to play it on a strong device. (PC, PS4 - PS5 etc.)",Negative
"This game changed my mind on turn-based RPG. Never been much of a fan when it comes to turn-based games (I played a very infamous turn-based game once and gave up eventually), but HSR did all the right things and changed my mind. The characters are great, impressive character designs, great game mechanism and awesome music. Love the humour and writing as well. I often look forward to play this game. Hope they will include jumping animation in the future?",Positive
"Love this app, only one negative note. Often times it will unexpectedly close the game altogether. It briefly freezes and sends you to your home screen. I do not recall this issue during earlier versions, Not planning on quitting but I'd like to see it get fixed soon.",Positive
Good afternoon i love this game but my ACCOUNT has reseted 2 times already and it is very tiring to do all of the starting stuff It reseted my characters and went back to zero,Negative
"This game is literally the definition of addiction. It's extremely fun, the game play, and the quality of the characters. It's just absolutely amazing. It's one of my favorite games.",Positive
"Lately there's been serious crash while opening this game. Even though I have higher mobile phone type, it seems that after ver 1.1 release so many bugs and crash happens. I'm not gonna lie if this can't be fixed soon, I will start stop opening and playing others interesting game. Sorry mihoyo (Updated : The opening bug issue has been fixed, but in game bug still happens occasionally, good enough for me now but not ideal for mihoyo I think)",Positive
"Latest story update had me motionless, staring at the screen trying to process what just happened. The combat is as engaging as ever, new enemies have made it more challenging. The new characters, although not needed to beat the game's content, have unlocked new and interesting ways to play. The only downside for now is the amount of time it takes to grind all the materials needed to max out your characters.",Positive
"The new moc and pf are just getting ridiculously hard, they want you to pull for every new characters in order to beat moc and pf. And of course the 50/50 rate is more like 99% yanqing they just want you to pay money to win. I am done.",Negative
"i delete the game I mean the game is good but the bosses are to strong, even if you have a strong character in the team, you will die because the monsters have the advantage of attacking you more than once and i dont heve time to keep playing to get good or strond relice, and this is annoying, and there are few defensive characters in the game. I hope at least that you make the bosses a little weaker or put in supporting characters.",Negative
"This game is great and fun however I feel like it would be more fun if there was co-op aspects of it where you can play with friends for instance you can roam around the terrain with them and do battles with them where you get to pick two characters to take into battle and they do too, otherwise this is a all around fun game and odly addicting. Love the character designs and great voice acting plus the story line.",Positive
Awesome game. Would be a 100 percent better if it had a skip button for quest storylines.,Positive
"Great game! I adore the combat system and the story, getting the materials to draw characters are much easier to get than genshin. My codes don't work for some reason though, like when I used the ""starrailgift"" I never received the rewards and when I tried to reclaim it, it said I had already claimed it. Besides that, great game with amazing character designs!",Positive
"my one biggest critique is the EXTREMELY tedious relic farming, there are so many substats in the game that it is so extremely dificult to reach certain breakpoints that make or break a character. Otherwise, still a really really REALLY fun game overall. A LOT of end-game content for old players, a lot of content for new players, not too overwhelming and very kind with rewards.",Positive
"I love your games hoyo, I really do, but please add something to decrease and increase the equilibrium, you can't move during fighting and my characters aren't strong to defeat current enemies. Just look at the bosses, you get I round after breaking there shield then it goes back full, it hard to play, just look at aventurine, I can't proceed to future trailblazer mission cause I have to defeat him,",Negative
"The fameplay is lots of fun, but I had very few opportunities to summon new characters. I got 40 pulls at the very beginning, then almost nothing. As far as I can tell, there are only about 4 pulls available per month. Most of which will end up being useless light cones (artifacts). Uninstalled.",Negative
Very nice and fun game with nice story and really beautiful characters.But sometimes I wish there was a co-op option so I could play with my friends and slightly more quest so I don't get bored when I finish every single quest.One other thing that I dislike is when you have completed everything get your character in the first half and then not having enough to get the character you want in the second half,Positive
I have logged in said America but all i see is screen of a train going through atmosphere. It does not go anywhere else. Can't even log out now.,Negative
"the game is great, sure, but there's one key problem in this game.. the graphics... even at the lowest quality, there's still some texture flickering and etc etc, ruins the experience honestly, just say, my phone is suitable for gaming but the game is just too much for my phone to handle despite it being a good phone for gaming..",Negative
"Absolutely download this!! It's an amazing game with so much put into it. My only complaint is how much storage it takes (~21GB) P.S. The storage space goes down after versions have finished installing!! If you don't have enough space to update, delete and reinstall - that worked for me.",Positive
"Just wanted to tell you that this is the MOST UNIQUE GAME ever! even most of the adventure missions are well-written and nice, let alone the trailblazer missions. It have the most unique and fun events I've ever seen, and coolest game mechanisms. It's very much F2P friendly as well. I am in love with this game, and i am looking forward to the new stories it have for us. Thank you HSR devs for making such a brilliant and amazing game, from the bottom of my heart, really.",Positive
"I love this game the moment I played with it everything is great. The graphics, music, storyline and Va. But 4 star because it keep closing the game, not all the time but most of the time. And Please please fix the cutscene idk if it is because of my phone or internet connection or maybe just the game. I tried everything I can to fix it still the same. It looks like a radio when your finding a signal to listen to it. That was the sound and the cutscenes looks like.",Positive
"I really love this game. Great characters, great story line. A great game. But, I had to delete honkai for a few minutes so I could download something. I re-download honkai again, I use the same email same password that I have saved and my account got either deleted or isn't letting me use it. I have over 100 hours on this game and I'd hate to lose it.",Negative
"Overall this game has been one of the best ones I have ever played, since I played it for the first time. I manage to play around 50 hours a week amd have never gotten bored of it",Positive
"I play this game religiously. The gameplay is rewarding, the story is deep and interesting (if a bit wordy), the music is stunning, and the overall visual design feels great. Worth trying if you like this genre of games.",Positive
"Top tier game, F2P friendly, great character designs, periodic event. I wasn't familiar with the type of combat at all, but it somehow pull me in and I like it now, it's not as action and rush like the genshin or pushing gray ones, but it's not boring really when you arrive at the late stages. Overall it's a great game with always a room for improvement.",Positive
"Love the game, characters, storyline all of it. Its just with the new update I can't have any other app on my phone because of how much storage it takes up. I truly do love everything about it, I just can't have other apps, and this one at the same time. I'm looking into getting another app to handle the 21gb it needs me to have so I can continue playing",Positive
"By far one of (if not the) best turn based gacha games out there, especially for ppl who live in f2p. Far more interesting story than I was expecting, a player avatar that's actually very powerful at end game, free units that are actually usable, plenty of things to do that don't rely on the energy/stamina system (when you run out), amazing OST, etc. Biggest con? Game takes up a lot of space. Not as large as Genshin but still, current update puts it at almost 40gb",Positive
This game is super polished and the characters are great. The combat is just ok. You can auto through most of it and getting more powerful is mostly locked behind RNG equipment. I would be good with all of this but the story is SO FULL of useless uninteresting unskipable filler I just can't continue.,Negative
"The game force closed quite often when I start the game. After it crashed for the first time, it ran smoothly though, dont know why...",Positive
Seems like it'd be a good game but it almost exploded my phone. If you have an older android I would not get this game. Firstly it requires a TON of space and is too much for my phone to run once it is downloaded. I played for maybe 15 minutes before my phone got so hot I was genuinely concerned it would catch fire. I put my phone in the freezer than immediately deleted this game I have not had that overheating issue before or since. My phone is only 4-5 years old and runs everything except this,Negative
"I absolutely love this game !! I really like turn-based games and the lore is nice, and I love the plot twists and characters as well ^^ however, a problem is that it takes too much space so I had to delete it ‚òπÔ∏è please please please optimize the space for this game!!",Positive
"This game is amazing for both people that want to spendmultiple hours a day playing, and people that don't want agrindy experience. It fixes the vast majority of issues thatmost people, including myself, have with genshin impact.It's interesting, creative, gorgeous, and has a load oflovable characters with an engaging storyline. Definitelygive this a shot if your an RPG fan or not:)",Positive
"Probably my favorite game at the moment, definitely tops every other gacha game. This game is quite generous with the free pulls and rewards it offers. I don't say this lightly - the game's story and world are truly immersive + characters are awesome. I quit briefly about two months after the game's launch because farming materials grew awfully tedious, but once your team is sufficiently geared, you can just put it all on autoplay. Above all, this game does not require a massive time commitment!",Positive
"Great gameplay overall, with an interesting story (albeit scarcely updated) and a diverse cast. However, it works atrociously even on a relatively new phone (Samsung S22+) after about 2 minutes of playing (mind you, at low settings). Also, there seems to be a weird bug in which some of the effects aren't loaded properly and appear as purple blocks, but I reckon a reinstalling should repair it (updating didn't).",Negative
"I'm very upset of this games direction I'm currently playing on another account but most of the characters I've gotten have been slowly power creep due to the buffing on the bosses health on mirror hall, if you could either buff the characters or somehow balance it out so that characters don't get power creep I wanna play the game but not under constant stress.",Negative
"Finally hit pity on an event banner and didn't get the character... then found out it was a 50% chance to get the event character in a TARGETED event banner. Just left a bad taste in my mouth and registered for the account to be deleted/uninstalled. 2 stars instead of 1 because I did have a good experience with the story over the past few days, but I refuse to be a supporter of this garbage. Thank you for showing how crooked the game is early on, though!",Negative
"Great game, it's a refreshing one after playing Genshin for so long It would be a 5 star rating if it is mobile friendly, Do note that I experience frame drops in this turn based game than in genshin which is more graphic, and also there's a thing where in main quest cutscenes, the audio is crunchy and chappy, and the the cutscene itself is glitchy. Please fix the anomalies as soon as possible, Thank you. P.s my phone is not the problem since I run genshin in High settings",Positive
"I love this game so much, and played it for a long time, but have recently had to delete it because it took up 30 GBs of my phone storage! Genshin takes up 20! The storage is just too much, and hopefully I'll be able to keep playing on PC, but please work on reducing the storage space.",Positive
"I loved it but suddenly there was an update and even when I did have enough storage it said ""Internet error"" and I'd be forced to reboot every time, and I had to delete 5 games for enough storage and like I said it still didn't work cause of ""Internet errors"" even though I had full bars.",Positive
"I've been into hsr since before it released. I watched a trailer with Bailu in it and immediately wanted to get her. I've been continuously surprised by the quality and standard of this game. I had tried Hoyo's other games (hi3 and Genshin) and wasn't into them, but hsr is quite different. I love the way it plays, the storylines, and the characters so much. I also like that unlike other ""free to play"" games, this one doesnt feel as predatory. You can easily get stellar jades by just playing.",Positive
"I absolutely LOVE this games, I love the style and the references, even the characters! The view of space and adventure was a awesome idea for it! And getting stellar jades at 120 is very promising and so are the events, even the puzzles are to get interested for too!",Positive
"Love the game, it's fun and the graphics are really good even in mobile. The simulated universe is an amazing idea and it's super fun. My problem is the relic leveling system. I recently stopped playing genshin and the relic mechanic/system is very similar to genshin's artifact system. That's not the problem. My problem is that with genshins artifacts could a few take months to get decent artifacts and that's one of the reasons I quit genshin.",Positive
"The story is amazing. Character designs and building are phenomenal , same with the music and graphics. Combat is incredibly fun and does require some actual thought and planning as well. Three things, though. One, hoyo, can I please win a 50/50 in any game. Two, I needed more Dan heng in penacony. Three, can I stop getting bronya on every banner? It's getting tedious. And I'm going to end this on, Imbibitor Lunae, Dan heng, or Gepard. Please marry me.",Positive
"0/5 They make this game too hard. Why do I have to take extra time to look up guides for everything. They force you to play certain teams or you die. Can't use the characters you want to use or you die. You have to use certain characters to win. Only one path. So stupid. 7/24 Update: Still the same. Shallow, dumb combat. Worst turn based I've ever played. Char designs are bland, no interest. Gave it 2nd chance after a year. Still trash.",Negative
I like the concept of this game and have been playing this game for quite awhile. I can't even by pass the new content with all maxed leveled characters with their proper set of relics. Its ridiculous on how much the powercreep is in this game. I love this game but it's making it pointless when F2P players can't even by pass new content without getting the new characters or even have good characters that are now useless to the current bosses.,Negative
"Great game, tbh. Love the details and graphics. Unfortunately it suffers from the same sickness as any gacha game, the amount of grinding is insufferable at the same time there's nothing much to do after a certain point. What a great paradox you need to grind but there's nothing to grind with. You should also add this to the genre of idle games for how much there's nothing to do.",Negative
"Thank you for this wonderful game! It's one of those that let's me play at my own pace without rushing. College has been hectic recently and I haven't been able to play games as much but HSR is really one of my comfort and loved game. Just the story alone keeps me playing, the characters are well written too and the music is soooo good. I really never thought I'd be in love with a turn based game.",Positive
"Great game so far,I give it a 4 star because there's a bug I've experienced when i changed my graphics quality the whole map(area) turned all white i cant play the game normally because of this bug, i hope y'all fix this thx (im still stuck with this bug i even tried restarting it but it didn't work).",Positive
I would give it 0 stars of I could. I downloaded it and tried to open the app and play about to 8-9 times and it literally always shows some error-1011 . It's frustrating and definitely not relaxing or fun like a game is supposed to be. I saw such good sponsor videos made on this game but I am deeply dissatisfied and disappointed. Please fix this error.,Negative
"After playing it for 1 week I would say the game has potential. Good story, neat character designs and animations. But the gameplay is dull as it's turn based. I can already sense powercreep since some characters finish off enemies quickly while others struggle to clear them at all... not a good sign for future. It also requires much more grinding than genshin as low level characters struggle to deplete enemy shields and HP quickly and get killed.",Negative
"I like the game, the story is great but after update i got a bug that always pop up (stage verification failure 2002) .When i fight boss and it's really annoying because i have to keep fighting over and over again. How to fix the bug please help me...",Positive
"This game got me deleting photos, Games and others, Whenever there's a new update because It takes so much space in the storage, And after deleting almost everything I'm stuck at the loading screen, The flying train thing, I'm halfway through downloading for the update then it immediately tells me that my storage is not enough, And crashes üíÄ Don't get me wrong, I love this game and all but like it takes too much space in my storage",Negative
Came back to the game and its confusing as hell as to what events to do what to prioritize. And the fact that there is no skip button makes it unplayable for me. I dont want to listen to npc uapping for 15 min or follow that bloated story dialog after some timr anymore. Do yourself a favor and dont play that game if you value your time since Mihoyo definitly dont.,Negative
"Honestly kinda ridiculous that it's not available on PS4, which is more than capable of hosting it when even Genshin is available there, a significantly bigger game. It's too big for phone to run now, and I don't have the money for PS5 with a perfectly good PS4, so I have to quit after months of progress.",Negative
"As one who plays on the PC instead of their phones, I'll give a review for PC. Honkai: Star Rail is a one a kind gem in the role-playing universe. I can not sing the praises enough for this game!! It's c a true breath of fresh air. It has unique characters, an easy to use and understood battle system, rewards abound, an interesting plot, and much more! Thank you for making such an AMAZINGLY KICK BUTT game!",Positive
Looked like it was going to be a top notch game with quality unseen in most other cell games good cutscenes spoken language with no translation needed and a really cool ARPG combat style sadly I didn't get to see much of the game because after the second fight the game crashed and kept crashing maybe you should have spent some of your cutscene budget on code stability,Negative
"This game excels in various aspects, making it a standout title. The captivating storyline is rich in detail and keeps players engaged, while the stunning visuals, especially at maximum settings, further immerse them in the world. Additionally, the well-designed character development and engaging material/relic farming mechanics offer players a fulfilling gameplay experience. Overall, this game is definitely a 10/10 in my book :)",Positive
"i'm going to said about this game is overall good, especially the design of character and the world. the story is good thoughts and there's a lot of rewards for players but the one is not fun is the gameplay. yes, the gameplay like sometimes is boring and really make me sleepy if i do comparing this with your step child game. but i'm going to said the design of character is really good !! (that's why i playing this game even it's boring sometimes)",Positive
"Ugh.. I feel so disappointed right now, there's alot of upcoming events and new characters, and I love this game whole heartedly yet I can't come up with an update anymore, my phone is in full storage and I really wanted to play to continually finish all the missions. Plus the characters has been releasing and these past few months and weeks, my phone couldn't handle it anymore so I gave up..seeing these new characters makes me wanna get them now. üíî",Positive
"I only put 3 stars because I really want to play this game, but I don't have enough storage on my phone and they never released the game on PS4 even though they said it would be released on there. Overall the characters look amazing and I love all the silly things I've seen from short clips. I'm hoping it gets released on PS4",Negative
"One of the best RPGs in 2023, and this is coming from someone who normally hated turn-based game. Auto combat means any grind fo materials can be completed without player's input, allowing you to do other things while grinding (provided your team is strong enough). Simulated universe is a fun rogue-like dungeon crawler with unique buffs and random event (that may or may not help/harm you) that challenge the player to strategize to win. Highly recommended.",Positive
"It is crazy the world we live in today. Honkai Star Rail is worse than a final fantasy rpg in terms of story and appearance, and yet Star Rail is seen more valuable merely because of advertisements, the cost, and mobile phone compatibility. There is no special treatment if you spend $1 or $10,000 dollars. The game is a black hole of misfortune.",Negative
I love this game. Everything about this is AMAZING. But I'm uninstalling it cause there's literally no way my trash team could ever defeat Sunday. But anyways this is seriously one of the best turn-based game that I have ever played and the events and world quests are seriously one of the best.,Positive
"Love the game absolutely legendary in both VA and game play it truly lives up to its hype, but unfortunately, it also lives up to its hype of a massive storage file on mobile with the current update it will take 30gb or more thus unfortunately I had to delete this game but I did enjoy this while it lasted maybe when I get a pc I'll download it there and begin my trailblazing once more but sadly for now my journey ends here. Thank you, Hoyoverse, for creating such a masterpiece.",Positive
"I wish 4.5 was an option. I love the game, but it is annoyingly anti spender! (I know, heard it here first) As a small spender i am happy to drop ¬£20 or so a month if it will give me good value but there's not really much for people who want to unlock lots of characters and only at E0. Whales will spend big for E6, but I am happy with E0 and currently there's no way to pay to play at that level. So my options are grind or skip. I work full time so i can't grind. TAKE MY MONEY MAKE A MID PAY TIER",Positive
"The Game is fine and all, but I don't really like it that much. Idk why, it's not so laggy like Genshin but it's still a good game to play, but the more you level up the harder things you need to ascend your charaz. That's why I'm giving it a four ‚≠ê. Genshin is probably better because I'm almost finished with it, but Honkai star rail is a good RPG game just like Genshin!",Positive
"Very good at the storyline, good graphic and tons of characters. I just don't like the way to play, I think should give us free space to play like genshin impact not like ur turn then my turn to fight enemies..",Positive
"It's good, but the game crashes every time I try to play the game. Its been crashing since yesterday, and I even tried to reinstall it cuz maybe it's just a bug, but I just finished downloading resources, and after entering the game, it's still crashes! What should I do?",Positive
Over all its an a good game and highly suggested. My only problem is im having trouble in grinding echoes and playing at all because my device keep crashing every minute or seconds. My device can handle highest graphics smoothly but for random reason it keeps crashing.,Positive
"A really nice game but varies on what device you have. When I downloaded this on my old phone it was very laggy and I couldn't see the background. But now I have a new device, and it's not laggy. So if you want to download this then make sure your phone is compatible with it.",Positive
"Unfortunately this game decided to borrow Cognosphere's other game way of handling gacha. You want a new character? Too bad, more low tier weapons for you. For a game clearly designed to grind material in order to try and unlock new characters, the rate in which you get said materials is low. The rates in which you get new characters is INSANELY low. It feels like squeezing rocks for water to try and fill a bucket with a hole on it. F2p, I advise you to stay away from this game.",Negative
"I've been playing since the very first day of release. Firefly, the newest limited character made me quit. She is so insanely overpowered and she got 2!!!! End game modes extremely skewed in her favor on release. Not pulling her is bricking your account. I don't like the playstyle so I skipped, My account was the strongest in a friend group of ten, now I can't even finish end game content while all who pulled her stomp it. All the fun I had has just evaporated",Negative
"Fascinating game, great graphic, nice character design everything is fine with this game ive been playing from the 1.1 patch and i deeply understand the game very well",Positive
"The game is fantastic, great storyline with awesome cutscenes. The game is also generous with items. The thing that disappointed me most is the connection. It always disconnects from time to time sometimes forcing me to replay cutscenes with no skip available. This never happened to me in Genshin and am playing absolutely fine with it so my connection is good. Server needs updating.",Negative
"As someone who play turn-based jrpg from little and a trails of series fans, this is definitely the perfect game for me, the break system added more complexicity for the game, love it. Formidable foe giving us a pretty good challenge and good reward from it, mix and matching the party for challenging formidable foe is quite fun and the fact that we could just retreat and re-strategize without nothing to lose is definitely a big win for this one.",Positive
"It works flawlessly.. well, might need a tweak since reaching Equilibrium level 1 is pretty hard for newbies, my progression got stuck since I reached a dead-end with these item and character leveling. (It's probably an issue from me) Also the fact that the graphics seems to have been glitched a little, the in-game objects are bugged that they only shows the low-poly/quality one regardless of graphic settings. (Playing it on Custom-High and once try to maxed it out, it doesn't fix the issue)",Positive
This a fun and addictive turn based RPG. There is so much so do and so much lore that it can seem overwhelming. It's really good for short or long gaming sessions. So far I haven't hit a pay wall which is a huge plus. This looks and plays great on my S23 Ultra at the highest resolution setting and at 60fps. Can't wait for the console version!,Positive
"Really good game but there's a glitch where I can't open up the notices. I told customer service but it absolutely did not help. I tried everything I could but nothing works and every other solution requires a laptop that I don't have. PLEASE fix this, it's super annoying!! update. I HAVE CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE SEVERAL TIMES. FIX YOUR GAME.",Negative
"The game is perfect but can you try to add jumping in this game it looks dull or something without a jump and can you add a co-op in this game so we can play with our friends since its getting boring without our friends joining in our world or let's just say its boring if there's no co-op please add co-op. I really love the graphics, character designs, and their personality and add some more characters in this game",Positive
"Boring story and monotonous side quests. The gacha is extremely stingy. The second map is also very unoptimised, even on PC. There is also no way of watching previous dialogues or cutscenes, which is to be expected from lore heavy games, and is common among other gacha games. The dialogue is verbose, bloated and bland and cannot be skipped. Edit: Three updates later and all of these issues still persist. Developers refuse to listen to feedback. 2.1. Is out and things are still the same.",Negative
"It's a very good game for me. The plot of the story is very interesting and will make people substitute into it. The characters of each story have attractive charm and characteristics. In addition, the game modeling is also very beautiful. I currently don't experience clipping or anything like that in the game. The music is also very nice and fits perfectly with the game scene. I highly recommend you to try this game",Positive
"So much to say about this game... Not too much in a good way but what I like: Complex but understandable upgrade system, nice art style, good SFX and music. What I don't like: SOOOOO many fetch quests! It feels like 80% of this game is fetch quests and we all know that's to expand playtime with minimum effort of game design. The decisions in the dialogues are meaningless also why do I have to decide on inner monologues? Running out of space... Okay time waster nothing too exciting",Negative
penacony is the best and the peak of fiction storyüëçüëç i dont really like beleblog and loufu story,Positive
"It was a 3 or 4 star game for me. But after that exceptional 2.2 Trailblazer mission, it has to be a 5 star.",Positive
"I love this game! But HOYO, can you add claim all feature?, is because I'm tired when I claim them one by one. Please add the claim all feature, I hope HOYO notice this comment! I love your game! All HOYO character is really cool!. Maybe this feature will add on the future.",Positive
"The mechanics themselves are fun, but very short lived. After the first few chapters, the game started to feel repetitive and the story fell off for me. With the first two campaigns ( the tutorial and snow world) there was at least some novelty with a new world and all the characters, but by the third campaign finished it just didn't feel fun and I was more focused on grinding the story. As a gacha game it definitely has something to build on, but the overall experience is mediocre at best",Negative
"Just tell me how to fix ""failed to unzip the game file"" Error... Please I already reinstall the game for 3 times and still this notification show up... I still have storage, already tried turning off VPN, firewall and anti virus... Still failed to unzip... I follow ever step hoyolab told me to do and still nothing... So what now?",Negative
"I liked the game a lot and I was waiting to play it since its announcement and even the role-playing system in it seemed unexpected and not favored by everyone, but the graphics, characters and story were sufficient to admire and spread it But the roles and properties of the characters are not completely balanced, for example,the character of Welt It is considered the only character that has the property of imagination,and not everyone was able to obtain it, This is difficult to cross the worlds",Positive
"I love this game, The characters are well made. The atmosphere is really Chilly and pretty because everything is modernized unlike genshin's. The turn-based fighting style is cool, I get to strategize and ofcourse enjoy the ult scenes. The game's really comforting, Not way too much going on. The layout is very similar to genshin so i pretty much understood it quickly. Huge improvement hoyoverse!",Positive
"Its a great game. I love the interaction, gameplay, character backstory, graphics. Its got the right mechanics for a good turn based rpg. The development of the character and game story is good. While it lacks the open world in Genshin, i found the game progression sufficiently satisfying for time sensitive people. Not everyone games for a living. However, the gacha system is absolute rubbish and while the rewards are good, the rates are so bad that you have to pay for SSR light cones and char.",Negative
"5 stars because it's a great game feels like playing a console game on your phone, characters are pretty looking like anime characters, combat is cool, voice actors are really good at putting emotions on their characters and the story of the game itself feels so immersive, But I only got one problem whenever I enter a scene in the game the voice of the characters are stopping, what I mean is that it's like a light switch voice on voice off until the scene ends, hope the devs fixes it...",Positive
"very good game so far, i have enjoyed the main story so much, not a fan of turn based combat but still enjoyed it, maps are limited and easy to complete which is good for people that don't like too much tedious and boring exploration and bad for fans of massively open world games. tho the game is getting review bombed by some people just because it is not Genshin in space, it is not meant to compete with Genshin and it's very different, people should stop crying about that.",Positive
"Good game, great storyline, detailed character designs, eargasm soundtracks, unique game mechanics, almost everything perfect. Though it's kinda sad that it is a turn based-single player only.. would be better if it can be played online with friends, at least just one friend, just like Monster Hunter Stories 2 for example. That would make it even more fun to play. I have lots of friends playing but the only I can do with them is either borrowing their character or lending mine for them to use.",Positive
Was looking forward to playing it but after downloading everything I got an error code 1001_3 and I can't be bothered clearing the cache and data and re-download everything again. Edit: Got in the game by simply letting the game reload by pressing ok on the error pop up. Played for a bit and its a bit laggy on my phone but playable. Only complaint so far is the login issue and hopefully it would be resolved on later updates.,Negative
"People need to stop saying the game is trash, because they can't even run the game properly. If you want to play you should be aware that you need at least over 20GB of storage before downloading HSR... And if YOUR phone can't run the game smoothly, it is not hoyo's problem, it is most likely yours. Thank you for reading.",Positive
"Good game ,intresting story. But i have just one complaint The difficulty spike is vertical",Positive
"1 month review! After being mesmerized by the quality of the cutscenes and animations, seeing the same battle animations over again does wear off its charm as there is a lot of battles and a lot of grinding to be had in higher levels. I think, deep down, the core mechanic is really team composition. The grind to get stronger does bitter the otherwise compelling story, lore and characters. It's the real ""price"" we pay to play a game for free. Im still enjoying as I love its world!",Positive
"It's a good game, the only, and number one problem I have, is how much space it takes up on my phone. I could only play the beginning part, and then I had no more space. I've tried getting it on my PC, but I couldn't even start it. I reinstalled it multiple times as well.",Negative
"I have been playing since release, and I haven't been disappointed. It's like most gachas, collect characters, and collect weapons. The F2P characters and options are actually really well made, which makes it suitable for non to low spending players. Design and animation is great and also the story. Once you complete the story and side missions, it does leave little to do, however. During this time, I just play to farm materials and equipment to build my characters, which can get a little dry.",Positive
"This Game has the most beautiful story and characters I been loving this game since 1.3 Version Stopped at 1.6, but I played again at 2.0 Loving the Sparkle character ‚ò∫",Positive
"Overhauled my review from before, almost a year from playing and i can confidently say this game has performed well, tons of endgame content, events and quests to keep you entertained. Plus even if you didn't get to pull for the newer characters, it's still very possible to beat the entirety of the game using ONLY 4 stars with the right gears and sets. Which cannot be said the same for other games, highly recommend if you'll consider playing",Positive
"Heads up! This is a turn base game. The maps are also fairly limited in travel and exploration. That being said. This game has done a wonderful job with the story, the characters and overall gameplay. The hidden treasures while exploring and immersing are all over. Like...who is this Garbage King? There are also choices you make that can determine what you are able to do later! Well done Mihoyo!",Positive
I dropped a star because im found something to be quite annoying... When i switch trail blazer to from physical to fire... The relics and light cone has to be changed manually... I do like that you can auto add relics and all but it doesn't always give the relics you worked on and its quite annoying to have to add them manually everytime i switch... Is there perhaps a way to set these to memory some way so that wen i switch its automatically set to the relics and cones i had?,Positive
"- File too big - no options for starred camera in fight, camera moving too fast.",Negative
Just got back after buying a new phone. One of the best games out there fr fr.,Positive
"Best, fun, great storyline with aesthetic animation (anime vibe). Recommended for someone loves idle game or turn base game.",Positive
Fun game play. Great battles. 4 stars because I deleted it. After a while the storylines becomes overly long and needlessly complicated. I just played 2 hrs on a storyline and battled a total of 20 min. It lost my interest. Ya I could do the daily battles for something to fight. But to be honest that gets boring. But overall a great game just not for me.,Positive
"I love this game! It functions very very well, about as good as the PC version. It does make my phone pretty hot but that's kinda expected for a game like this. It's very free to play friendly, and provides frequent updates and events. There are battle passes, free version then paid version, and paid version is very worth it if you play at least 2-3x per week. The devs listen to their playerbase and are frequently introducing new and highly requested QOL updates.",Positive
"In all seriousness, I came to this game because I'd hit a wall with Genshin and wanted a break. I didn't expect I'd love it this much. The characters, the story line, the fact that they're so generous with rewards and warps just make it amazing to play. It has massive quality of life improvements they should be implementing in Genshin. Great game!",Positive
Very good! But the quest is too hard and I don't like the enemy having extra action sometimes.. But still good. üëç,Positive
"Love everything about this game: characters, lore, gameplay. It also offers tons of rewards.",Positive
"Honkai: Star Rail was a huge success! Never have i thought a turn-based game would be such entertainment. So many generous rewards and all characters have super fun and unique gameplay and designs whether it is 4 or 5 star. Very good story line and a smart move to make seperated maps. As a mobile player, playing at high graphics can slow down my gameplay and the loading of map. Since parts of the maps are seperated each, it makes it easier for my mobile to process it and load the entire map.",Positive
"Six times 5-star characters, 3 losses in a row, 3 from the standard banner, and the result is what? E2 Welt E2 Gepard, what the hell is going on??!Hoyoverse, I'm not your enemy üò° Updates: 13/01/24‚ÜíAnother loss ‚ÜíE3 Welt 17/04/24‚ÜíAnother Loss ‚Üí E3 Gepard 17/05/24‚ÜíAnother Loss ‚ÜíE4 Gepard",Negative
"Great game, I've been playing since release. There's a problem I'm recently experiencing though: When character's idle comes with a prop (of some sorts, like Dr Ratio's handkerchief when he wipes his book) it the props tend to show up or move more later than the actual idle; so I'd appreciate if this gets patched up in a future update. Other than that, best game ever",Positive
"The turn base fighting system is so useful for me, because i can play it at high ping like 300ms now im mad üò° because after all these hunderds pull i only got Dan heng and dan heng more than twelve times !! while i need pela and galagher, how can i get them if the gacha system unbalanced",Negative
"I played the game for a day so far so good yet I encountered some few bugs, when I switch character, their normal attack button that is supposed to be switching drawings but sometimes it stays the same as I switch characters. Not a serious problem but I hope to see more improvement outlook of the game.",Positive
I was playing the new update and was about to defeat the Sam boss in the most recent event when the game just crashed and made me go back on half of my progress üò≠üò≠,Negative
"I had so much fun playing the game. The only concern I have is the lack of quests. It's getting so hard to get into the main quest after trying to level up from doing everything, but alas, it's still not enough. Unlike genshin, I can gather so much xp from quest in order to level up my ar. I hope in the future update there will be more quest in order to level up",Positive
"This game is just like genshin but different combat. Not only that, the turn based combat really sucks. It's not that I don't like turn based combat, its just there's no verity for the combat in this game. The attack options are press button one, two, or three. Genshin also has a turn based combat option (tcg), but I feel like it was better executed because you had more options to choose from. The only reason I'm giving this a 2/5 is because it's new content from a game similar to genshin.",Negative
"combat and combat voice lines get boring pretty quickly imo, aside from that it's a really good game !",Positive
"Amazing turn-based Game, graphics are beautiful, story is plentyful, as hidden stories/easter eggs and explorations do exist. Only bad thing is that powercrep can be seen on the horizon, as typical of a turn based gacha, but if you don't care you should be able to complete the main quests with your favorites. The Game system is easy to understand and there is speed up autoplay for easier farming. It can be boring if you want a hack and slash like HI3/GI. F2p beware, it's just a generous start.",Positive
"Gameplay, Story, Puzzles, Character Designs, OST, World Building, Graphics, UI Design, everything is top-notch. On top of that this game is f2p friendly and the gacha system is one of the best (pity system & cumulative guaranteed 5*) The only problem is my phone's battery drains quickly when playing this game. Maybe add an option to reduce graphics quality even more. Other than that this is almost a perfect game for me, 5*",Positive
"Turn based combat engine done well. Simpler on the options when compared to offline turn bases jrpgs, but considering this is a gacha which is reminiscent of epic seven in its combat style, I'm very pleased. Though they do need to increase the content after ar 40 as its essentially dailies for 10 AR levels before getting to increase one's equilibrium again. In general though, fantastic basis for a game to grow off of.",Positive
"I gotta say this might be one of the most mind-blowing game I've ever played. From the quality, the graphic, sound effects and visuals, it's magnificent. Also cheers to the voice actors, they're doing a seriously great job on their role. Don't get me started with the storyline sometimes can be unserious and goofy which I really love it!",Positive
"I love Honkai Star Rail. The story, the gameplay, it's perfect. Also not to mention, the character designs are wonderful too",Positive
"Played this on my pc and so far I haven't encountered any problems at all. Still haven't tried it on mobile but hopefully there will be no problems :^) 10/10 for me, storywise it is funny and immersive. Gameplay is good, love the ultimates they're very cool. And, well, more generous than I expected xD 50 pulls in and I still have a lot of those hmm, I forgot the name, but the primogem equivalent of the game and the tickets. Lovely! Looking forward to the future of the game.",Positive
"Same as genshin, this game is amazing. If it's anything less than 5 stars from anyone well again, it's definitely not the game. Because it is most definitely a 5 star game",Positive
"Its the fact that this game needs the completion of story to unlock the map and the combat is just starting to be more boring,also the fact that every new patch, the character will overly powercreep the older ones. I understand it's to make ppl pull, but dont make it too much, and one more thing, the game is heavily locked by quest and story,which isn't very casual for some ppl. Ik this game isn't for me,but i rlly like the char.design & music,I know hyv never disappoint when it comes to them.",Negative
"Had great fun, do keep in mind it's gacha game. The story ,the lore ,gameplay. I absolutely loved it.",Positive
"Overall the game is surprisingly very enjoyable. However, there are still so many bugs in the game. Not to mention, the app is somehow draining my battery way too fast and made my device heated up even though I've only play it for 5 minutes. Looking forward to the adjustment and fix to these problems~",Positive
EDIT: 1.1 offers almost no new content except a childish search for grafiti marked clearly on the map and the museum which is just running back and forth. Minus 1 star. Same quality game design/functionally and interesting/funny missions as other Mihoyo games. But once you've played through the content gets boring because it doesn't have any of the free exploring and secrets/chests searching or variation of mini games/puzzle that Genshin offers and kept me playing back daily for over 2 years.,Negative
"Hello, Day 1 player here. I like the game so much. I have played FGO before. The experience is nearly the same as that game, but there's more to explore than FGO. I really love the puzzles, and I am so glad that the daily puzzles in Luofu were added! With that said, I will suggest add more of these daily puzzles, specifically the ""cart pushing"", ""push the boxes to rescue people"" and the ""path"" puzzle. The puzzles are so fun, and I can't wait to try more of them everyday!",Positive
"Looks and plays amazing. I'm hooked. I think hoyoverse need to work on more realistic model movement during conversions and more diverse character shapes. All the girls look amazing but at the same time, generic. That aside, i hope star rail lasts a really long time and is supported as much as genshin impact. After looking at some 1 star reviews, they're not to be taken seriously in my opinion unless you are short on hone memory then it could cause your game to crash",Positive
"Great gameplay! I also love the story and the characters. I'd give it a 4-star for now because it frequently lags whenever there is a cutscene even though I already set the graphics to the lowest quality. I hope this issue can be fixed as soon as possible. Overall, I'd still recommend this game to people who haven't played it yet.",Positive
"Great game, challenging combat, beautiful art style, good story for a mobile game. I removed one star for 2 reasons; first, getting the rarer heroes is extremely difficult because the rate is very low and you barely get any summoning rewards from the game, and paying doesn't get you much as packaged are ridiculously expensive. Secondly, there's just too much text. I've been playing RPGs all my life and I love a good story but don't appreciate unnecessary constant chit-chat that I cannot skip.",Positive
The game seriously good. I like the auto play feature and the double speed. It feel way too slow without it. One thing i find annoying is very difficult to login sometime. Error occurs randomly. Stuck on login screen and it takes too long to load. Downloading update can get stuck and get error. I don't know what the problem. I found that this game doesn't like slow internet speed. Mine cap at 3mpbs. Genshin Impact have no problems on login screen. IT ANNOYING.,Negative
Story telling is very high quality and most of the characters have well fleshed out back stories. Each character is unique and they all have interesting qualities. Each planet/place that is visited is beautiful.,Positive
"honestly this is one of the best games i have played, the turn based combat system is something i wasnt expecting! /pos the story is also lovely and so is the scenery but i cannot look past the fact that my phone is already getting warm at the loading screen.. while playing i also noticed that it basically eats my battery. as much as i love the game, the constant overheating and fast battery draining isnt it",Negative
"I like the game actually, i love it's owned mechanics that doesn't have on Genshin and Honkai 3rd and because the game is newly released i understand it when there was a bug that I've encountered like in the inventory when salvaging artifacts, the puzzle only found in Xianzhou where you pop the balloons by rotating and moving a fire projecting objects and sometimes an error when logging in to my account and i hope that it can be fixed and improve the game in the future updates.",Positive
"Wonderful game overall, the music is insanely good. Graphics are AWESOME for a mobile game. Story so far seems to be very good. Even tho I'm not a fan of turn based combat this game does it well and i liked it more that i thought I would. And the best thing overall is that this game is not actually greedy, doesn't really encourage and/or pressure you to buy stuff, rather the shop is there for those players who want ""more"" because the game already gift you chara at the get-go",Positive
"This game is just amazing, I've never thought I could like a turn based game so much! The story is so interesting and beautiful, I can't wait for a new update rn cause I pretty much did everything possible in this game. The music, the cutscenes, the dialogue choices top tier and the way some of your choices actually matter! A 5/5 for me. Patiently waiting for Dan Heng IL rn so I can get him haha <3",Positive
"I've played dozens of these kind of games but I can surely say that this one stands out by a mile. Wow, where to begin? It has a really engaging and complex story, great voice acting, interesting characters that grow on you. The first world boss fight is EPIC. The music, the tension... It just draws you in and you wanna play more to see what happens next. Hats off for the team behind this game.",Positive
"The game was pretty good and ran smoothly but all of a sudden since the last week the game has started to consume a lot of internet, even while am just walking it consumes too much internet(literally got to 500+kbp/s every other second), and just merely doing dailies uses upto 300+ mb of data. This issue needs to be fixed asap plz or else it might be very difficult for me to continue this game. (I actually liked the game pretty much)",Negative
"The game is outstanding. Story, Characters, and the World design are amazing. Probably one of the best turn based games out there, especially an anime themed one. The gacha system is the same as Genshin's which is good to see, and weapons as lightcones are a good touch as well, characters are more pleasing to look at with their own stand alone weapons and not other's. The cutscenes and soundtracks are also unbelievably good.",Positive
"I love turn based games, but this is my favourite one yet, the characters,the gacha, the fights have got me really hooked to the game. Theres only one problem. IT DRAINS MY DATA EXTREMELY FAST. There is no multiplayer in this game yet it uses up more data than most of the multiplayer games that i play, in less than an hout the game has used up 700 mb of my data. Please fix this i think many other data users have to hold back on star rail because of its data usage.Thank you!",Negative
"As of right now (middle-ish of second world) the game is amazing. Yes, you only have a basic attack, a skill and an ultimate but this feels like a proper jrpg like final fantasy/tales of franchise. If you like those types of turn based games give this a shot. Plus you don't even need to spend money (as of right now) since the free team they give you is good and can carry you.",Positive
"I find this game completely beautiful, the characters, the landscape, animations, ulimates. it's all just so beautiful. I find this game so much more fun & easy to get investive in than Genshin when I used to play Genshin I dreaded farming for artifacts, and farming for characters because the process was so long and not fun (in my opinion) , but with Star rail, the experience is not completely dreadful, and it's actually quite fun. Definitely an improvement since Genshin.",Positive
"Great graphics, amazing and cute character designs, love the game play, have yet to experience any bugs aside from audio distort from intense scene's like the short anime from the start, people complain about the log in error or disconnection, I have experienced it but it doesn't happen often and if it does it doesn't disturb any major game play or take any fun out of the game but still should be fixed, i know there are some aspects that you know they took inspiration from but its not a big deal",Positive
"Loving it so far! For someone with arthritic hands, the turn-based play is awesome! I really love the graphics, and the story is great too! Even better are the QOF improvements such as even more teleport portals so easier to get around, you can easily teleport to the various dungeons, easy to collect ascension materials, f2p characters can get you thru the story (I'm waiting for the update now). One improvement would be more events to buy gems with bonuses (once only is not enough!).",Positive
"Literally doesn't play, it gets to patch updating and crashes every single time.",Negative
"Super fun and addicting game! Also support is amazing, I reported what I thought was a bug and within maybe an hour there was a response with information which was actually helpful for the problem I was having! The style is cute, the characters are fun, the story although I find it cheesy at times is actually quite enjoyable. To put an hour or two into every day it's rather fun 10/10",Positive
This game absolutely sucks outside of it's story to get good characters you need crystals. Which you can get within the game easy right no. You can farm your whole day away to get enough pulls for a 5star just to lose your 50/50 it put you in a bad mood after all them hrs just for your hard work to be trash or you can take the money route which gives you only 25 to 28 spins for 50$ and for 100$ its 44 the prices are way to high for what where getting just to lose are 50/50.,Negative
"Been playing since it's release, So far this game is amazingly great both to rewards, story and all. I hope this keeps up!",Positive
Absolutely in love with this game. Such amazing characters and stories. I've spent countless hours from Herta Space station to Penacony,Positive
"This is easily a five star for me! The story is good, the voice acting is really well done and the character designs are cool. I'm surprised my mobile can handle the skill animations smoothly on medium settings. Sure there are minor bugs, like mouths not moving on cutscenes for some characters, but it's tolerable. Overall, it's a great experience. You can move on with storyline even with f2p and just build the characters that you get.",Positive
"I like the game so far. I usually play on weekends of during free time so my progress is quite slow. The 4 star is because it think the optimization could be better, and I would really appreciate a 45 fps option since it seems to be my sweet spot in terms of mobile gaming, particularly to maintain decent smoothness while still saving my battery.",Positive
Always creates great content. Really amazing game,Positive
I love it. Better than genshin impact in my opinion cuz of so many free rewards and how it helps f2p players. And love the story so much especially penacony,Positive
Some gave this game 1 star 2 star and 3 star rating because the game doesn't run properly maybe your phone has a problem and not the game you morons.,Positive
"I love the game but has it been crashing alot for anyone else, besides me, I didn't have this problem before and now it just started",Negative
"Firefly and Acheron Impact. Have any other favs? Well the game doesn't care, its all about the waifu of the moment and nothing more",Negative
very bad representation of dark skin tones in player characters.,Negative
"Best game I have ever played! I have tried and played at least 200+ games. I have gotten bored of them all excluding Honkai Satar Rail and 2 others. This is absolutely a fantastic game! Grrreeaaat story lines, with new characters, levels, worlds, equipment! It's ever evolving, in a good way. You can play this game for hours without needing to wait for energy to pile up or constantly feeding the game money! This is a tip top game that must be tried for any fantasy, Rpg or adventure game lover! A+",Positive
"Great game, the quality, the art, the mechanics and story is all superb. But there's not that much to explore once u reach a certain point, you finish quests continue with the adventure, but there's barely any open world interactions, which make the game less playable as time goes on. I loved it at the start, but once I get higher begin to lose interest due to the repetitive mechanics and quests.",Positive
"I like this game alot, the design, the storyline and the character lord is just great. I just don't like the fact how we can't join others world. I have played many games and one of my favourite thing is to join my friends world and play with them but as it is not possible in this game it makes me abit sad about how all we can do it talk with our friends but now explore and fight bosses together.",Negative
"I just started playing this week it's amazing I love the graphics, the designs it's so cool!",Positive
"I've got an amazing experience so far with this game. But please add 45fps option like in genshin. It would be even better if you could add custom fps option. My phone (poco f4) runs great on 60 medium settings but at the expense of extreme heat (reaching 46¬∞) and battery life. There's 30fps option but it's too choppy, 45fps is a bare minimum for me and it would be a great addition to the game. Thank you in advance, I'll consider giving it 5 star if the developer added setting :)",Negative
After the recent update the game is not opening. It logs in then goes blank.i don't wanna miss the eventsü•≤,Negative
"It's great, i love it. At first launching it was lacking content tbh, but now it kept coming out, so we have actual things to do in game, and it's pretty challenging in my opinion. i don't have problems with the character pulling, but the thing that annoy me the most is the relic drops and lightcone gacha banner, how can i lose 75% chance 3 times on lightcone banner lmao?? it's very fun to play but one day i'll actually lose it if i kept lose the 75%, it's not even 50/50.. it's 75/25",Positive
"This game is amazing, i loved itüòò the reason why i rate this 5 stars is because 1. The controls in battles are not that hard and lastly, The characters design is soo nice. There is some problems like the game takes soo long to load, so you will need abit of patience when entering the game. And then everytime i first enter the game it lags soo much but later on the gameplay becomes smooth. Please fix some bugs and lessen some of the animation but otherwise the game is perfectüíó",Positive
An absolute masterpiece in the world of storytelling with twist and plot that keeps me on the edge of my seat (and maybe yours too).,Positive
"Exceptional, fair, and generous rewards almost every patch. Characters never disappoint, truly fun game",Positive
"The gameplay is nice, beautiful world building, good plot, great battle system,good looking characters, but its currently so full of errors, sometimes it gives me an error notice, sometimes im stuck at the opening screen, and when it does load, its either, so laggy, or has visual issues, i was expecting star rail to be better for low end devices, but genshin plays better than star rail as of lately I hope you fix all these issues",Negative
The game is great. I love it . But a week after i play the game it get crash . The ms is always 200+ idk why. At first the game really go smooth but after a lot of update it become crash . I hope u guys can fix it. I will delete the game and try to download it again to see the problem will be gone or not. Btw thank you so much for making a great game.,Positive
"This game is very good, it can be afk, rich-story, there are also many good characters... but very hard to come by because I'm F2P haha.. Love this game so much!",Positive
"At first I thought turn-based game in not my type and I thought there nowhere turn-based game gonna be good turn out I was 100% dead wrong, HSR prove any genre game can be quite good if it done right",Positive
"I love this game.(I am a little bit biased, because of the amount of hot men this early in the game.) So far I am really happy with the dev response to any bugs or inconveniences in the game, it's fast and effective. The graphics are very nice and the story is actually entertaining! I haven't found myself being this invested in a game storyline for quite some time now. And as all hoyo games, the music is fantastic. Keep up the good work!",Positive
"The graphics, musics, and storyline is amazing as well alongside the jokes inside. The detail that hyv has put in this game made the game more interesting to play. My previous rating was 4/5 star but recently i've been encountering many problems. The game mysteriously shut me off mid explore and the game often shows login error. It doesn't happen much before, also it'll be nice if hyv expand the map for wider explore since HSR is a new game with incomplete patches we got bored easily. Good game!",Negative
"Here's my take to HSR since day 1. The game has similar vibes with GI and HI3. The graphics is nice, characters and VA are topnotch, gameplay is smooth and lots of events and rewards. Powercreep is barely felt since you can clear most of the content using basic units. Downsides are after you clear all the quests there's nothing much to do. Lack of content. Farming good equipment with good stats is extremely difficult. You also need to build a lot of characters to be able to join MoC(Abyss).",Negative
"i absolutely adore the honkai series, been here for years! i love hsr especially, one problem though, i'm on Android 11 and everytime i fight the Doomsday Beast weekly boss it crashes. i'd report the bug using the in-game option, but the screen turns white whenever i try, so i'm resorting to posting this here instead. i should specify that i'm on version 1.50 and i've already cleared space, restarted the device, reinstalled the game and made sure i had a good connection.",Positive
"Obviously, a few things here I wish were done differently. Just for streamlining purposes it would be cool if you got trial characters you could choose to use during the main story to make it kinda flow better. But because it's a gacha game it kinda takes away from the meeting characters aspect. At any rate, the game is a ton of fun, free to play friendly, and crafted with care. Best turn based strategy RPG on mobile. The story and characters are great.",Positive
"Generous rewards, fun mini games, interesting puzzle, quite a challenging MoC (maybe a bit too hard), and amazing story (even the side quest). My only hope is. . . Maybe tone down the MoC difficulties OR give us more double drop in gear, because I can't keep up building gear for new characters for MoC, heck my old characters are not even maxed yet, and that's why I stumble behind because no relic with amazing stat yet, not maxed out skill yet and so on.",Positive
"Saw those edits on tiktok and got me downloaded this game. Fr, i didn't expect to be so addictive. Def worth it and hoping for more interesting update. Keep up the great job!! :D",Positive
Game updated and I lost my entire account. Their customer service SUCKS at resolving this,Negative
"I will rate this 3 for now until the issue with the graphics is fixed. My phone is able to withstand medium graphics of Genshin Impact without lagging but somehow, this game's surroundings and structures turn white whenever I set my graphics to low or medium (the default was very low graphics). I really like the game and I hope you can fix this issue so that I can be fully immersed with the storyline.",Negative
"This is an amazing game, DO NOT go into this with a closed mind or thinking it will be similar to genshin or HI3rd. This game is a turn based strategy at heart with an amazing storyline, some of the quests can be a bit grindy (I'm looking at you museum quest line) but overall the side quests are fun. The ost for this game is amazing, the music team are great at what they do and I listen to this music a lot. Pros: Good story Good gameplay Few bugs Cons: Very grindy The gacha is annoying at times",Positive
"It's a great game and I've been addicted since day one and that might be the reason why, but there is not much for me today now after completing the story and side quests. I've even got the battle pass missions done and the pass is still going on for 20 days. Besides waiting for my energy to refill and do dungeons there's not much to do. So eagerly waiting for the next update",Positive
Too expensive and money hungry. everytime i gacha it's always pity (80 draw). I don't know why people always posted that is easy to get 5 star character but i didn't experienced that. Thinking of uninstall it now.,Negative
"Everything is perfect. Perfect to the last minute detail. Every character is just perfect in their own way storywise and design wise. The reward for events and other rewards is just abundant, please keep it that way. Thanks for such a good game that I can play during class so I don't get bored",Positive
"great game! the content are awesome, characters are all great, they also give plenty rewards, its f2p definitely recommended!",Positive
"the game still functions fine technically (you can still move around, do quests, fight enemies and stuff) but after the 1.1 update (silverwolf) the environment textures no longer load in. the models are there, its just that they're invisible now. during the 1.0 version the textures were working properly... they messed up smth and they haven't fixed it yet",Negative
Game is absolutely great but the fact dialogues are like 5 minutes long and unskipable is really frustrating.,Negative
"I really really love this app (to the point of addiction) so now I'm very devastated that I can't log-in for some reason. I don't know if it's my internet connection (I can still open Genshin) or if it's something else but my opening screen keeps showing ""Checking for Data Updates..."" and it ends up as a log-in failure. What do I do? I am desperate and hurriedly finishing my side quests since my vacation is nearly ending. Thank you in advance",Positive
"I play on mobile and this has been by far my favorite game of all time, graphics are insane, character designs and the gameplay, although a few days after the new update came i can't seem to open the game, I kept on crashing even before having the access in the log-in screen.. I have a fairly good phone and it has been running the game well, since the release. I tried redownloading it but again I couldn't even pass through the log in screen.. can you guys fix this??",Negative
Very fun I got soo lucky I got 1 qingque 2 or 3 pela and 1 bailu the story is fun and funny I loved that there is a character named sampo lol and the place's is beautiful I love it loved the update's love you hoyovers ‚ô°,Positive
"loving the game itself and on my pc I have no problems playing, however on my phone I was only able to play it once. for several days I've been kicked out of the loading screen, right when the game is about so start. I log in, press enter and then it quits. I'm not sure what might be the cause but it's a shame because it seemed to be working well that last time I played it",Negative
"Not stingy in rewards especially stellar jades!! üòçüòçüòç Superb storyline, be it the main one or the aide quests. üéâüéâ",Positive
"The game is good, though some aspects of it can be annoying like the drops. My first playthrough was great back in May, but then when I returned, my experience now consists of frequent lags, screen freezing, out-of-nowhere crashing, and now suddenly rebooting my phone while I was just doing some farming. Playing it basically requires patience and if these issues persist, I may even have to resort to buying a new phone in order to keep supporting the game, which is frustrating.",Negative
I mean this is a full game pretty much. Cutscenes voice acting a whole story. Turn based combat but a little more interesting. BUT it still is a mobile game and is very mobile gamey in a few ways. You can play without worry about it for the most part though. Yes cloud save no achievements,Positive
"Good game, but disgusting equipment farming system.",Negative
"This game is very good and very enjoyable. The characters and the storyline got me invested and look for more! My only dissatisfaction for this game is that it's too much a grind especially when it comes to level up a character. Char level, light cones, traces, relics and more. For various character to do that. It bores me out. Also, I hope the devs find a way to minimize storage a little bit because the new update size is insane. Other than that, I'm happy with the game.",Positive
events shouldnt be locked behind multiple day long trailblaze missions. nobody with a life can ever complete them. game is designed by neets for neets,Negative
I guess it's a good game but there's already so many bosses already even when i just started playing the game but the characters designs are good and I'll just gonna give this a decent rating.,Positive
"The game is a very fun game, the characters' personality are very fun and straightforward, they all have unique personalities, now the gameplay, im not very much fond of turn based games but star rail does it very uniquely, example clara, when she gets hit, her robot friend auto counters for her, damage scales of def, very unique. Its also easier to get 5 star characters here compared to genshin impact, the resin cap is higher and its rate of drops. The story is very fun and entertaining. 10/10",Positive
"As is the case with most hyv games they're seemingly still scared of people who look like me, it makes playing the game feel as if I'm not truly welcome there",Negative
"I absolutely love the game but tbf there's just one thing missing and it's co-op. I know that co-op with a combat system such as hsr would be pretty difficult but if it could be added somehow, that'd be great! otherwise I love the game. It's easy to farm for jades and ascending characters and weapons as well, and the auto battle system is refreshing after genshin's endless grind",Positive
"Pretty basic RPG with eye candy element. Unlike The previous title, your choice can actually change the flow of the conversation (before it get railroaded again). The absent of [obnoxious mascot that talk a lot and interrupt even a simple conversation with repetition] is a big plus. The BREAK gauge is kinda strange tho, enemy can simply recover from break and hit you on the same turn. Unless you play Himeko, the break system kinda feel less rewarding.",Negative
After download and reboot the game menu isn't showing. Just a train in space background. What the hell?,Negative
"It is the best gacha game I've played in a while. Not only the graphics and the gameplay, but also the story is really amazing. I love the fact that almost every character has its own gimmick and adds value to your account. The only bad thing i found is the lack of content in the long term: login, dailies and weekly missions. Everything becomes very boring and repetitive but that is a problem that has every gacha unfortunately",Positive
"I Find it fun, but sometimes I feel like I lack some materials in game",Positive
"To start off, it is closer to Honkai Impact in terms of exploration and open-world experience yet mixed with Genshin Impact leveling and weapon systems. The adventure aspect of the game is really well-done considering the limited space it had in each maps. It is more tactical since it's a turn-based RPG and the break system really elevate that aspect of the game.",Positive
"Absolutely thrilled to rate this game a solid 5 stars! It's not just a game, it's a whirlwind adventure that keeps you on your toes. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is smooth, and the storyline is captivating. Plus, the fun factor is off the charts! It's one of those games you can't put down once you start. A must-play for any game enthusiast!",Positive
"I've been playing since launch after getting into Genshin half a year ago and I gotta say, I am even more impressed with Star Rail than I am with Genshin! The turn-based combat is fluid and easy to understand but still complex enough to have a good time, the quests and events are lots of fun, the attention paid to quality of life changes is wonderful, and the characters are all so cute I never wanna stop farming for pulls!! I can't wait to see what Star Rail's future holdsüíñ",Positive
"This game couldn't be more addicting. I'm serious, I just want to keep on playing. Great characters. The designs are spectacular and almost everyone is well written with so many twists. Music and places are also great. The humour and Easters are so funny I found myself almost choking from how unexpected and funny the situations were. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because of how long we have to wait for the trailblaze power to replenish. Makes me wanna go crazy!",Positive
I was not expecting turn based gameplay to be this exciting. Different game modes make it really enjoyable.,Positive
"i really like this game, but I've really tired of the glitches. i can't complete the quest, because when the dialogue starts, my screen starts to lag and then game crushes. the same thing about the Herta's worlds, when i approach the level with boss - it's all crushes, so I can't complete it. i need to close and open game about 4-5 times, so it may work. maybe the issue is the model of my phone, maybe some another thing, but it really kills the game experience. just sharing. thank you üôáüôá",Negative
"I love this game! I've been playing since it first came out as a download and I've been hooked. My only issue right now is the fact that I can't load it nor even download the game back onto my phone anymore (Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra) Its really frustrating that I can no longer play it on the go, rather then playing the pc version (which is perfect by the way).",Positive
"It looks great, I was expecting combat to be similar to Honkai Impact 3rd, but it ended up being turn based, I'm not a big fan of turn based combat, only a few games with it capture my attention, aside from that the story seems pretty good, there is a small bug with effects, whereby they show as a Pink square or rectangle.",Positive
"Great game!, although it takes up a bunch of storage its fine really. Just wanted to suggest, i think if this game could have online multiplayer that you could play with your friends would make it better, even if this could be a hard thing to do with the stuff like stuff that isnt really supposed to be played by 2 or more people, it could possibly be done. If this game does get multiplayer it would honestly make the game a lot more fun! As you could enjoy playing with friends and not just alone!",Positive
"Amazing game, Amazing devs, 10/10. Game just gets better and better with each update. If you don't like turn based games, rip you lmao. If u think u won't like it because it has autoplay, autoplay is only for grinding resources, you can't use it in the story or for a full clear of the hardest content (MOC/PF). Only downside is, you can't skip dialogue just like Genshin. Annoying for people who can read fast or just want action rather than endless dialogue.",Positive
"Amazing game, as expected from Hoyoverse. The gameplay is engaging and fun, the puzzles do not feel repetitive and the story is great. I also love all the jokes and the humorous mc. The music is also wonderful. As for bugs, I didn't experience any serious bugs myself and the game ran well on my phone aswell as my laptop. I had very high expectations for this game since the day it was announced and I was surprised to find out that the game still managed to exceed them.",Positive
"Overall Good in many point , story , soundtrack , character design (Somehow too bad the costumes can't give at least a little fanservice like other japanese Gacha Game.) , free rewards etc. Bad point is it consume too much battery on the high-end Mediatek CPU & Mali GPU. About 4 times power comsumption from the app than previous Genshin Impact , even on the Medium Graphic Settings. This made the uncomfortable gameplay experiences.",Negative
"Amazing graphics, characters, and trailers. But something just keeps pulling me back to Genshin...",Positive
"I've been playing this game since its launch and I'm having a lot of fun. It is enjoyable and addicting. Now that it has the 2.2 update, it seems like it makes me a bit unhappy and kind of mad. I also played GI for the past few years but I stopped since I only have a low-end phone and I lost interest in playing it. Star Rail runs more properly on my phone but the update today is a lot bigger as it takes up more storage space. Now I can't play the game anymore. Thx for the satisfying experienceüòä",Negative
"Im actually having problems on downloading the game data needed to play, ever since i change my phone it crashes mid download making me having to download it again. That aside its actually a pretty fun game, the characters design is great and so it the world, very generous with the reward too.",Positive
Literally more rewards than genshin to be honest. Any please release hsr on other consoles like PS4 because I'm slowly running out of storage üôè.,Positive
Everything about this game is really awesome in scope and ideas. The only thing more awesome is the size of this latest resource download: 24G!!! That's almost half my interval storage! I love this game. Everything about it. My phone just cannot handle that much info and still be a phone. What a bummer. I'll try to get a deeper phone. Hope the game continues to be a success. Cheers!,Negative
"I played it. It was fun for a free to play game but it is very you have to pay or it's going to be a way worse of a time. I think if they gave a bit more chances for free to play it would be nice. Also, they're free 80 pulls was a lie from what I can tell cuz I've been playing this for like months and I've counted how many poles I've got 25 pulls in the first month and I had to get the stellar Jade to do that. But I didn't get any free pools from the advertisement that they said",Negative
This game is eating up all of my storage space. I'm going to have to delete it soon. 36 GB?!,Negative
"I want to keep my rating at 2 stars mainly because there's a common glitch or bug that hasn't been fixed and it ruined the whole gameplay experience for me,the game is awesome and the graphics are outstanding my flagship phone can more than handle it yet somehow the cutscenes,they lag and stutter with the audio that hurts my ears and I can't enjoy any cutscene,another problem is the ping gets high for no reason as I have fast Internet,hopefully it'll get fixed so I can switch my rating to 5.",Negative
"Made it through the tutorial, and was informed that I had INSUFFICIENT SPACE to download AN UPDATE. AWESOME graphics, PHENOMENAL music, TYPICAL gameplay, too bad only MILLIONAIRES are intended to PLAY, apparently! I removed it from my phone, and it shall NEVER grace my handheld device with its B.S. again. Too bad, honestly. As, I was wanting to live it. üòî üò†",Negative
"Unable to login ""too many request, please try again later"" is there a way to fix this on mobile?",Negative
This game is an absolute travesty compared to genshin. It's greedier considering most characters are just going to underperform and suck without their light cone. And some characters just straight up suck without 5 stars. It's most recent Penacony story is nothing but a giant waste of time that's all spectacle and no actual thought yet it drags on forever with the most contrived plot ever conceived. Do yourself a favor and refrain from downloading this.,Negative
"I play on mobile and sometimes the cutscenes are lagging, making the experiences for the stories less enjoylable and I have to lower the graphics so I mark this between 3 and 4, on the other hand i enjoy the game.",Positive
"Surprisingly generous. Events give good amounts of currency and daily missions are easy enough that its not a chore to keep up. The character designs are mostly super cool, the voice acting is phenomenal, and most importantly, the gameplay is really satisfying. Manages to feel fast paced despite being turn based. The story can be hit or miss but I personally enjoy it. Character building is timegated which is always meh but expected. Overall, very neat if you like gatcha games.",Positive
It's a great game and I've been playing since release but one of my biggest problems is getting past bosses. I get people want difficult stuff and endgame content but there are some materials I just can't get because they are locked behind bosses I simply can't beat. I feel after losing a certain amount of times you should be able to use a friend unit to help of at least get a way to get the materials. I would build my characters but the thing to help get a decent build is locked behind the boss,Positive
"NEW REVIEW!! I'm gonna say this once and I'm not afraid of saying it twice, I. Love. This. Game. Everything here is just amazing, from the immersive story to the wonderful characters is just (chefs kiss), even the playstyle is easy!! My only request is that, I hope there's more quests and events available, I practically did almost everything. But other than that, keep up the good work hoyo!! ü´∂ü´∂",Positive
"Love the story, good gameplay but severe performance/optimization issues on one of Samsungs newest phones - S23 FE. Sometimes major lags in battles, especially against Stellaron Hunter Sam. Audio keeps playing but interface lags, tapping ults or attack takes 10,15 seconds for it to display the animation etc so a very poor experience in this update overall as earlier after updating for this version, I could not even sign in as game crashed at validating rss but it was fixed later with support.",Negative
"I just hate the YouTube ads. I've had 6 ads for this specific game in ONE 30 min video. What says after the 30th ad, I'll download? What study told y'all that??? It's wrong.",Negative
"Hi. I've been playing Honkai Star Rail for a few months now and everything was going well up until a few weeks ago. The map and certain textures were being unloaded and reloaded, which sometimes caused me to fall out of the map and I would have to restart the game. Could you please fix this. I'm not sure if it's my device or the game but please do something about this if you can.",Negative
"The new hoyoplay is absolute bull. Get rid of it. I can't even install the game becuase it somehow says that genshin impact is an old launcher, I redownloaded it this Wednesday, how is it old??? Get a grip. There is no option to not download with this launcher for Star rail, but I got genshin for windows just fine?? I don't want nor need this integrated nonsense.",Negative
"Good characters, adventures, great maps, lovable characters. But too bad u choose a turn-based game that's like +35% boring rate for most players cus repetitive battle strat and it's a numbers game(hi-stats always wins), don't get me wrong the mechanics pretty good, but there's also auto combat now u really did a good +50% at boring rating for players. Players will only enjoy this for like a week or month, after they realized how boring it is. Good luck keeping players in a turn-based game.",Negative
"Another great game from mihoyo, great va, great story, and great characters. Only downside this game has (to me atleast) is that you need a good high end phone, you can still play it with 32 GB storage and 4GB RAM but it lags alot and youd have to sacrifice graphics quality for a smoother game (unless your me who doesnt mind watching a power point presentation and cranks up the graphics to medium or high).",Positive
The new boulder town super league event is so hard I can't even clear it and get the stellar jades. How do I play this game with paying for e6 characters? Not f2p friendly I tried for hours can't clear it within 7 cycles,Positive
I love it! This game is amazing I would definitely give it 5 stars the graphics and everything overall it's amazing but I have some few problems the game keeps on crashing and if i dont play it for a week I have to download all the resources and takes a long time it takes at least a day to download all the resources I hope what I'm saying make sense and I hope my grammar is good overall love the game just wish you could fix some of those bugs I just mentioned üòÅ,Positive
My game is freezing when getting into any battle what is happening? I tried a lot of times,Negative
A really fun game tbh I LOVE turn based games and this one did not disappoint also the art style and graphics are awesome really immersing storyline too (I really liked the mcs) but the one thing that bugs me whenever I log in it crashes and i have to try again which works still it bothers me a lil bit which can be the fact that this a pretty new game all and all really good game :D,Positive
I love this game but you guys really had to copy genshin impact like i love the game but overall im pretty impatient i just downloded it today but i do not like waiting though but i hope its worth it but please fix the game so i only have to wait a few hours to play becouse genshin impact took forever i downloded it back a year ago and it made me wait until 11:30 so i hope you make the wait shorter,Negative
Love this game really great characters. Love the design and everything about this game. Gives good rewards to players which is something that genshin could never do. If I had to say my only tiny issue with this game is that at some points in the story it feels like they rush certain scenes and big moments. But honestly IDC that much about that. So for me full 5 star.,Positive
"The storyline and character development in this game is insane. The game deals with such a variety of emotions and themes. There is so much content from events to quests and frequent updates with so many interesting characters. You always feel valued by the game as well, the rewards are so good and it makes you want to play more.",Positive
This game is super cool!!! Thank you so much for providing such a wonderful experience with the awesome story and characters! üôåüî•,Positive
This game is a very good turn based rpg to a certain extend with a good story. Visually beautiful like genshin. However the base characters can get you majority of the game but the lack of variety and pulls let this down. Missing out on Seele is a huge blow and would of been helpful for my team build. No luck. The. Curse of gancha games,Negative
"I've played it since launch now, and it is a fantastic game. Took some characters straight out of honkai impact 3rd and make it a whole different game. I love turn base rpg games and they really made this game works well. Overall, it's a solid turn base rpg with good storytelling. However, I have to decrease my rating due to the gacha being very frustrating, instead of going for something like Honkai Impact 3rd which separate the equipment and character pull, they instead stick to Genshin model.",Positive
"Generous game, good characters, locations, osts, gameplay, etc. Probably the best turn based game you will ever play. Relic system is as awful as Genshin's but at least auto mode exists. The game has some degree of difficulty, its not easy, but its not too hard either. Overall, I enjoyed this game from release until now.",Positive
"Honkai Star Rail is reallly an amazing game!!! The features are all good, the character design , the weapons , and the gods of the game is really fascinating ü•∞ !!! In my opinion However i wish the characters could jump and have more different auto atk just like genshinüòÑ and can co-op like only avail for 2 players each player must have 2 characters and can fight the bosses and some monsters but its all good tho. Its a really nice game. The rewards are sooo satisfying!!!",Positive
"Love this game My only problem with this game is that it takes too much storage space, not the Dev's fault since this is such a high quality game",Positive
"Best gacha ever I played. Positive things I get from this game. 1. Graphics. 2. Characters and Storyline. 3. F2P friendly and super generous with rewards. 4. Stunning artstyles. 5. Farming is easy and all characters are useful. If there's anything that's bothering me, I would say it's the GB needed to download the new updates, but I know it's reasonable because of how great and visualized the game is, so I give it a good perfect score for it's purpose.",Positive
"Very fun game, probably the best mobile game out there in the market. I always thought this type of game would be boring but this is the first game that is actually fun to play.",Positive
"Insane game, the stories super cool, the best part is it's open world and I'm not an big fan of like turn based games but still this game impressed me in the turned based battles, super cool stories, I wish you can make more games like this but make a few like not turn based but still very good I have played genshin impact and its almost like genshin impact in story and it downloads less data meaning that it's good, keep up the good work, keep making it interesting",Positive
"I absolutely love this game! It's very fun and enjoyable to play, the cutscenes, characters and visuals are outstanding! I'm intrigued on how simple the combat style is but somehow is still fun. My only problem now is that at moments the cutscenes get mildly choppy so it's kinda hard to enjoy the smooth movements and beautiful environment. Overall this game is worth busting my storage! :D",Positive
"Gameplay is simple, and not anything too innovative, but not bad either. The main story has some decent writing, but much like Genshin, it ends up becoming extremely and unnecessary long and complex, forcing you to do endless back and forths. This problem is even more apparent in the side stories, with some requiring you to go back and forth between 2 or 3 people multiple times before giving you a tiny reward that barely feels like it was worth the time you just wasted. Overall, a mediocre game.",Negative
"Great, keep cooking though we need more events because there's so many characters I'd like to get and I don't think I can with my luck but great game by the way! I wish there were less crashes though....",Positive
"I love this game, I've played genshin impact too and this game did not disappoint in any way. That being said, the game still has a long way to go with more story and content. I've been encountering an issue where the game randomly crashes (mostly during battles) and I have to restart the game, so pls fix this ASAP",Positive
I like the game except the combat system I love turn-based games but the way it is done here feels shallow and lacking depth. I'm just tired of turn based with skills that just increase stats also the characters only have 3 skills so they could've been more creative with them and they just focused on visuals... The skills just boils down to being the basic attack but better or a weaker version of the ult (for most characters) there's barely any decision making on what skill to use.,Negative
"It's no doubt the best honkai game we'll in their perspective genre.. well nonetheless their subsidies on pulling character is no doubt will be as great as their predecessor Honkai Impact, Truly Recommended and must try",Positive
"Hi, this game is very good. The character designs are very very majestic and the gameplay is stylish. But here, i want to complain that i kept getting stuck on a dialogue, and the characters would glitch, the dialogue keeps continuing but everything froze. Please help",Positive
"So far I think its living up to the hype, I love the turn based system personally and it is a simply stunning world. But its structure is almost identicle to Genshin in how you obtain Summon currency, this was great for a new game, with new events and brand new players, but towards the 2-3 year mark we'll most likely see a slow down for f2p as resources from achievements dry up. For now though, few connection issues but still being free these developers put the effort in making a AAA mobile game",Positive
"Didn't like Genshin, Impact was overwhelming but this? So far it has been absolutely amazing. Love the turn base system, makes multitasking yet enjoying the game so much easier. The UI is easy to navigate (neuro divergent friendly) and the story drew me in. Initially I was just planning to see what game play was like on launch yet by the time your character comes to be I was hooked. Really recommend!",Positive
"Everything here is soild. I've seen a few people trash the game after learning it's turned based, but I dig it. In fact, I think the gacha elements are made more worthwhile by it. I'll be honest, the dev's previous games can be a bit bland, especially in the gameplay department. But HSR's combat introduces that diversity, games of its ilk need to survive, and offers incentives greater than waifu collection to motivate character acquisition. I look forward to playing more. GGüëç",Positive
"It's a great game, I love that it's turn based combat. There is a lot to do, I mean that both ina good and bad way. Graphics are very good, the sound, vibe, controls are all well done too. But the game is like 19 gigs. Bigger than some RPGs on my console games.",Positive
"Absolutely love this game, at first i wanted to download genshin impact on my pc but when it said ""downloading game data"" it said it needed 10h+/- and it always switched between +/- a few hours so i gave up and also wasn't able to play it on mobile so my friend suggested this and i was very skeptical but it's my favorite game now even if it's mobile!! I had no lags till now and the graphic is amazing!! Just that the characters can't jump triggers me a bit lmao",Positive
"Honkai Star Rail is a visually stunning mobile game with a highly engaging combat system. It offers players a thrilling experience by combining fast-paced action with strategic gameplay. While some may find the quest repetition to be a downside, the compelling storyline and captivating characters more than make up for it. Overall, Honkai Star Rail is a must-play for anyone looking for an immersive mobile gaming experience. I love it.",Positive
the gameplay is good and deep-ish but the story is uninteresting and i hope i could skip it one day,Positive
"Honkai Star Rail offers a captivating gaming experience that seamlessly blends stunning visuals with strategic gameplay. One of its standout features is the diverse roster of characters, each with their unique personalities and abilities. The character design is not only visually appealing but also contributes to the immersive narrative, making the journey through the game's story truly engaging.",Positive
"Better than Genshin, thank you for making playing the game feel rewarding and fun, including casual and more late game/ sweaty content.",Positive
"I love this game. The gameplay is really drawing you into the world of Star Rail series. Just like Genshin Impact, your game is outstanding. It's just a little sad to not jump or climb, though it's an amazing playstyle. Your puzzles are better than Genshin puzzles, that's for sure. Enemies are way different although it's a small list of enemies, maybe with more enemy types it'll be more fun to explore. I love that this game is f2p, not like Genshin as a p2w or p2p. Amazing job! Thanks HoyoGods.",Positive
"From someone who has never really cared for turn based games, I find this game to be quite enjoyable. Everything from the story to the gameplay is great, and the character designs and animations are beautiful. I've put a good amount of hours into the game already and have no complaints. I can see myself playing this game long into the future.",Positive
Fun game and they make it where we can get stellar jade easy I just hope that they can make farming for artifacts and traces faster and better,Positive
The game is really good and I like the story and maps. My only problem with the game is that it's hard to log in and play the game. It sometime crashes when it launches or it has an error code pop up or just crashes and prevents me from logging in altogether.,Positive
"I every like it! But,every time I log in it shows an logging error and refresh the game. I'm okay with that, I would give this a 10 star to this game but it's impossible.. All the characters designs are impressive, good, and cute. I'm very happy that it does not lag like any hoyoverse games. I'm every impressed by your game.",Positive
i hate you because you made me lose 50/50 almost 5 times in a row and it's not even funny ‚ò∫Ô∏è,Negative
"Looks good from what I have seen , But can't play it , as it lags on the opening screen . Probably my phone's issue rather than the games, as while not a potato it isn't partially powerful. It's from the creators of Genshin impact, and flashgitz made a two part story , that ""referenced"" both games . Both are good .",Negative
Add the skip button already.. am really getting sick of this,Negative
"So far the game itself was pretty fun and explorable, it's a turn based games with great open world map. It's so fun to play ther rewards were a lil bit small compared to any turn based games but nevertheless it's good. My only problem was it's optimizations where not good in my device because it heat quickly my device and sometimes it turns black screen and what I do was just to refresh the apps but that's not a good solution I hope you do something about it. Overall it's pretty fun to play.",Positive
"Best online service game so far! The improvements in 8 months as they choose to add more endgame content, Good & fun storyline, F2P friendly, Fix many UI problems, and listen to the players' critics. This game is amazing, and I enjoy playing since day one Some problems I have would be Xianzhou storyline being rush and wasted the potential it has. The pacing was messy and Dan Heng story could have been handled better. Hoping Penacony would handle their story better as it shown to have potential",Positive
etar rail realy good for large largeeeee & Very generous because Staler Jade gives us so much and gives us so many ideal characters. Thank you Hoyverse & Star Rail Team.‚ô•Ô∏è,Positive
"It was going well until I got my first 5 star which was bailu. Now I don't have a problem with her BUT after getting her and sharing it for the wishing gems, the app suddenly crashed and wouldn't log in even if I tried to. I tried to log in and out my account from the app but it didn't work, it just keeps saying the error code and to try again later. I was able to play it again but after reopening it when I accidentally closed it, it showed the same error.",Negative
"I've played like 10?ish hours of it so far, it's actually brilliant. The turn based combat is a nice change of pace from a previous Hoyoverse game (Genshin), and the exploration is actually so good. The little in jokes and constant references are a breath of fresh air and just truly enjoyable to read. Some of the wacky hidden exploration stuff is great too, like the closet in the hotel! Absolutely recommend if RPGs are your jam!",Positive
"Great story, great battle mechanics, interesting characters, fun enemies. Pocket sized open world for exploration, chock full of pop culture references, hilarious side stories. Just a bucket of fun tbh. It's not super grindy, so if you're looking for a game to spend 18 hours of your day on, it's not gonna be this one. Unless of course if you read every book in the bookshelf, those are also entertaining.",Positive
"Love the game, caricatures, and story so far. It's nice you don't have to spend money to enjoy it too. Well done, and I would definitely recommend it.",Positive
"Simpler than Genshin in every way, but that's exactly what I wanted as the more simplistic combat, map, and complexity makes it a easier entry point. Game is still a phone killer though, the opening cutscenes are laggy and has awful ear-screeching audio, and I can't get stable 60FPS on the lowest settings",Positive
"I'm having some issues with hsr after the new update recently. I can't log in to the game and it keeps giving me the error code 1001_3 thing. At the start screen, the train was gone and so the floating meteorite. I didn't have this issues on genshin despite having a potato phone. The character glitches sometimes but I don't really mind. I kept reinstalling and it still didn't work. Please fix this issue ASAP because i can see that some other players are also having the same issue as me.",Negative
"Game runs very well, it's optimized. Graphics and presentation is top notch. V.A. is also great. Writing is cringe and has poor consistency in tone. Character designs oddly does not feel sci-fi. The designs feels like each character is a pop-idol waiting to perform on stage. I do not feel as though the playable characters belong to the world presented. Gameplay is boring when comparing to other similar gachas. Lack of active skills. The 3d exploration is tiresome because of chest loot.",Negative
"I have to say that I didn't think another company would attempt to create an RPG this thorough. After chaos rings 3 I was spoiled and nothing really compared. Suffice it to say I have high expectations for this game and hopefully it completes the story as beautifully as chaos rings 3. High marks for style; story presently incomplete, however could have explosive ending; love that progression is tied into your TB level, probably a take away from CR3. Can't wait to see where y'all take this ride.",Positive
"Top tier game, missions can be a little too much as in, there is a lot of them but besides that, really good game",Positive
"Really good and all the only reason I put 4 was that one day I wasnt able to play ( vacation ) so I did not play the game and the next day, I played it but it made me restart from the very start!! I was really upset because I was very far into the game and I was having fun and I didn't want to repeat it. Other then that, the drawings, animations, yeah. All of those are great and overall, it's an amazing game def would recommend",Positive
"From what I've seen in ads, this game has got great mechanics, design, and more. But when I tried to open the game, it kept closing when it's loading and I have even unistalled and downloaded the game again but it still wouldn't working. Please fix this because I want to play this game, it also keep saying login error occured.(It says 1001_3.). ;-;. (Please fix it quickly)",Negative
"the game is really good and has amazing visuals and a great story along with gameplay, but i almost everytime i want to log in i get an error and if i retry it keeps sending the error message. to get rid of it i have to restart the whole app again. ive seen someone else complain about this so it seems like a bug and i hope it would be fixed soon.",Positive
"Awesome Story and Combat. I am lvl 35 at the time of this review, so I have finished the story so far, and I must say this is one of, if not the best, mobile games I have ever played. It's totally possible F2P and doesn't feel like you are required to pay at all. The characters are all distinct and unique, having a great chemistry with one another. I highly highly recommend this game. I hope to see guilds or some detailed systems at some point.",Positive
It's fun but really hard to beat the bosses or get the five stars,Negative
"as expected, the charaters, the music and cut scenes r stunning! Gnshin has set such a high standard it's hard to not compare them. I think Star rail is fun, not a fan of turn base, but the action are fast and can set auto, their ults are so smooth so it gets u really indugled!! my only pet peve is the beginner rewards and the difficulty, in genshin we could go far with early charaters, this need real builds, and reward r not as generous as genshin, still 5 star exeprice tho, m still playing F2P",Positive
"Truly one of the best gacha games I've played to date. Beautiful quality, and immense rewards, with amazing endgame. (Don't even get me started on the awesome gameplay) Nothing more I could ask for, and even then they add stuff nobody asks for yet everybody needed, but the one thing that separates them, is the fact that they LISTEN to feedback. A must play title, at all costs. (Best part is it's free)",Positive
"Just started playing the game and already love it, the art style the storyline the gameplay it's all great! The combat system is simple not the greatest but still pretty good (a bit too simple for me) the only problem I have is optimisation. I'm sure you guys can do better with it. Also whenever I turn up my reflection quality the whole screen goes white and only my character is visible.. Why?",Positive
"Tried it because it share a created with Genshin impact but was left disappointed. A standard turn base game with over the top craggy characters. It's only 3 Months old so it might grow into some good later but is a bad spin off of Epic 7 or summoner War currently. Great sound tracks and battle music, just like Genshin. The story is a mix of Sifi & adventure that left me confused as to what was happening and why",Negative
"Love this game. It is incredibly fun to play with lots of amazing quality of life improvements compared to genshin, the combat system is deeper than I expected for a turn based game, the story is exceptional with a very good music. The graphics are amazing on my phone. The character designs are on par with other hoyo games aswell, which is to say, they are great",Positive
"I have never played any Honkai games till this one and it's because I'm a fan of Genshin. However, I really love the graphics, the soundtracks and surprisingly even the game mechanic itself. This game's lore can be overwhelming to new players like me, but if you can get pass by it‚Äî it's worth the play. Plus, it plays smoother in S21 Ultra than Genshin just by a tad bit. The developers must have been trying their best to smoothen the gameplay here. Hopefully Genshin will adapt soon too.",Positive
"I absolutely love it! I just wish there was some customization for the player's character,aside from that its amazing,love the animations,the voicing,does run a bit hard on the phone battery and has times where frame rate drops but those will likely be ironed out in a bit (plus i could just lower graphics settings) ALSO i should say there is a lot of comedic content in it and i really enjoy that as well lol",Positive
"Its an amazing game with great details and varieties of characters! But theres a few bugs or probles, 1) when ever i login to the game theres an error and when i restart the game it works, but theres sometimes when it takes more than 2 tries to start the game. 2) In some details like in herta's ult her diamond is completely black! And even the crystal things in Belobog.",Positive
"I uninstalled the game last year after playing it for a month, but reinstalled it recently to give it another go. After getting the free Dr Ratio due to the generosity of the game devs, I finally managed to progress in the story and I love the game. It has been 3 weeks since I started playing but I have already dropped about 300 dollars, and I am looking to spend more. This is an example of a game done right due to the generosity of the devs and in return players will give back to them.",Positive
"Sketchy marketing, and a disappointing disillusionment phase when I realized this was not, in fact, Genshin Impact in space, but a competent turn-based gacha RPG. The weakness break system feels impactful, and while you *can* take down opponents with a strong team comp without necessarily matching their weaknesses, fighting a boss without will occasionally be a close call, or a defeat. On that, the auto-battle feature. If you have epilepsy, maybe give the game a miss, 2x and autobattle kill.",Positive
"Honestly didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I am. I'm not typically one for syfy settings and space, but I can't put it down! Runs super well on my device (galaxy s10e) with minimal frame drops. It's crashed twice so far but the game's just barely out of beta, so leniency where leniency is due. Story is solid and well written with a lively cast of characters!",Positive
"I was a big Genshin fan but it's hard to keep up with! You can't exactly put it down if you need to take a break for a second. This game is a lot more compatible with my lifestyle. Otherwise, it has a lot of the features I loved from Genshin: engaging landscapes and characters, events, quests, and mini games/events that break up the usual gameplay. Looking forward to more! In future I also would love to see characters with dark skin tones. That was another thing that put me off of Genshin.",Positive
"This game is amazing, i love the voice acting, fighting, and ive grown so fond of the characters.",Positive
"I really like the gameplay. It's been a while since I played a game of this genre. Graphics, animation and sounds arw great. The only downside for me is this game consumes mobile data so fast so I recommend that you play this game on wi-fi. Another suggestion to make it more better is variety of clothes for the characters.",Positive
"Good game whenever on the go, good characters, love the art style and story.",Positive
"I can't believe how good this game is. I consider this a masterpiece of F2P mobile games. I didn't play it for ages after release because it looked and sounded like another dodgy gacha. How wrong I was. It's super fun, with great characters, storyline, RPG development and gameplay. It's cross-platform and looks amazing on PC. It's a masterfully crafted game and I'm just sad I didn't start playing it sooner!",Positive
"The gacha here is absolutely atrocious. Don't be deceived, you absolutely need 160 pulls minimum to get 1 limited char, and you need at least 1-2 extra copies to be actually useful in end game.",Negative
"I thought this was gonna be another cash grab gatcha game, with overly sexualised anime characters and endless pay walls. However I was genuinely surprised to see that is actually a very well made game! The story is slow but interesting, the fighting is simple but complex enough to require a bit of tactic at times, and the characters all feel fleshed out and interested. Pull odds aren't amazing, but they're not really required, and best of all they don't thrust half naked women in your face.",Positive
"I've been waiting for this game for so long! but when it's finally release sadly i encounter a bug which i can't enter no matter what but ofc everyone's expecting such bugs in new games including myself and just wait a couple more days then finally everything is fine! So yeah thanks a lot for fixing the ""error"" immediately although there's still some glitch/minor bugs but that's it all i can say for now is ""everything's so good so far and everything is fine"" thanks for listening no need to rush",Positive
"The game is very fun to play- it is certainly difficult at times which keeps it interesting and the characters are fun. The combat is lovely. What does bother me is how poorly it runs on all of my devices, crashing regularly. It also takes a long time to load which can make gameplay a drag.",Positive
"This game gives me ""convenient and flexibility"" to play it. Well, it perfectly fit my daily routine, i can play whenever i want and it won't spend too much time to clear daily quests so i can focus on many other things.",Positive
"It's a turn-based RPG gacha game but the game rewards are generous and there is a good amount of endgame content and different enemies, battlestyles and game mechanics. The game also let's you auto battle and store excess stamina so it doesn't feel like a chore, you can genuinely play when you want and skip if you're too busy without feeling like you've lost out. Also you don't have to fight camera angles so there's no vertigo induced here. Story is easy to get into, not too complex yet. :)",Positive
The story are getting longer and boring. Too much gibberish talks. But still they wont add skip button,Negative
"Greqt game, excellent story and graphics. Even my old phone can handle it fairly smoothly, however there are some bugs that are really annoying! Whenever i use autoplay, the game freezes and i end up having to restart it, losing all progress on a boss. Fix please or compensation!!",Negative
"I first downloaded this after it was released but sadly I needed to uninstall it. After weeks I redownloaded it again and I was disappointed since the Astral Express was cut in half, it keeps crashing during fight or during game, missing graphics:( I hope you can fix this after the next update (Will change the review after my complains are solved)",Negative
"I LOVE HONKAI STAR RAIL- From the moment I began playing it, I became addicted. Each character more incredible than the last with the story even better, the graphics and designs topping it all off. Nothing is behind a ridiculous paywall and the gacha aspect is at good odds, especially when you come by a bunch of tickets early on. Overall, an amazing game I'd recommend to my friends. Personally, it's not glitchy, but that's just cause I play PC. I hope everybody else enjoys this as much as I did.",Positive
"At the time of writing, I'm a few days in and am Trailblazer Level 23, and I can say I am thoroughly impressed. The story so far has been pretty interesting and I find all the characters to be likeable. There's a rogue like mode as well that adds in much-needed variety, and it doesn't seem too hard to f2p. There's also a lot of improvements over Genshin's daily grind, like making Calyxes able to be queued multiple times and auto battled and making the daily quests much easier.",Positive
"Mihoyo shows that they've learned from many of their mistakes made in Genshin Impact and have crafted an all around higher quality experience with Honkai Star Rail. The core gameplay of Star Rail is consistent, beautiful to look at, fun to play, and full of character. Genshin Impact fundamentally turns into a different game when you're finished exploration, and quickly becomes a chore. Star Rail's endgame is better in terms of both quality of life, and endgame activities. Give it a shot!",Positive
"The game has good graohics, the battles are also fine tbh overall the game is good the onky part where I hate it the login error part, I know how to take care of it but it forces me to download the files that I already downloaded. It's kinda annoying tbh and I hate it since all I want to do is just olay then some login error just randomly show up after updating everything. Is there anyway that you can reduce this or is it like that? it's really annoying",Negative
If you enjoy turn based old school final fantasy style combat(with enough of a twist to not be exactly the same) but with the latest graphics and animations this is may be a game for you. Story animations and VA may need a little more time to flesh out for every character but the game runs smoothly on mobile with few issues. Standard hoyo practices for monetization so rerolling isnt required if you plan to play long term.,Positive
love the game!! great artwork and shows how much effort the game designers have put in. Keep up the good work guys!,Positive
"very good üëç there's an improvement on the mechanics from the other games they released, generous on the premium resource and the gacha system kinda improved too; the story is cool even if at the beginning it's kinda confusing and fast-paced, it becomes clearer as the story progresses; my only complaint is when there are cutscenes (be 2D or 3D) it crashes the game + bad audio hence the 4* rating, thankfully when you log on again the cutscene starts, so you didn't miss it but it's still annoying",Positive
"Not very engaging. Battle is turn based which is ok until auto battle option comes along. Then it just feels like your only role left in the game is to run around and level characters up when needed. The battles happen automatically taking away the gameplay and leaving the player with a graphic novel to real. The dialogue is long and gets boring after a while. However all that being said, the graphics are very nice and voice acting is also good. Over after 2 days I got bored and left.",Negative
Love the game just wish there was backbone support. Too many times I have accidentally zoomed in game when trying to move the character and the camera at the same time. The drops are also bad. You can do six fights in a row for calyx crimsons and get one purple and maybe enough blues to make two purples. We should at least get one purple for each challenge since you need a lot of them for just ONE character.,Negative
The best game I have ever play so far!!! Very nice game It doesn't matter if it's music or special effects there's so perfect,Positive
"First this game is amazing! If you have ever played any other hoyoverse's games and loved it well this is your perfect pick. It's super detailed and the character designs looked fantastic not to mention some dialogue are pretty funny too. Although for a few cons: It's a game where five stars can be pretty expensive,a another thing is storage space which it does take up quite a bit and finally it has to be played in 30fps. With all that said it's super fun with long adventures along the road!",Positive
This app forces you to full on create an account with email required. Cannot just play as a guest or something.,Negative
"I had a great time playing this game for several months! It offers a lot of content but it's easy to fall behind and become overwhelmed. I hate to say it, but today was the day I decided to retire from Honkai. Thank you for the good times! It was fun to play during launch but it's too stressful now. Like Genshin, it feels like work and it feels like I will never catch up. Let us hide and dismiss missions... please!",Negative
"It is really good and I love the characters' designs and animations BUT the moments are nothing compare to games like genshin, they seem super stiff and not smooth (when roaming)like those knockoff Yandere Simulators you would find on here. The lore is good and the characters are cute but I hate how much the Spaces are limited.like you have to go to and from and teleport EVRYWHERE I just wish it allowed you to walk places and actually roam around.Also there is SO MUCH dialog, this is not a movie",Positive
"It's a good game but when you have your people at level 50, it's way harder to upgrade the other stuff and level 47 enemies can kill your entire level 50 team, what's the point of grinding all this time if you can even beat enemies levels below you. Not saying you should be able to kill them easily but it should be a pretty easy fight. I can't even pass episode 3 in the simulated universe because of that. Please change that soon. I really don't wanna stop playing because of that.",Positive
"Finally a turn based RPG I can enjoy, I'm familiar with the genshin gameplay loop, and it shares enough similarities to transfer that knowledge here. Mostly play on PC, but a fair amount on mobile too, I'm experiencing some bugs on mobile thou. I get a few crashes here and there, and sometimes I just lose control of the whole game (can't move or use any menu), so I have to restart the app to fix it.",Positive
It is an impressive game with incredible graphics. It also offers a more relaxed playstyle compared to other games. The quests can be completed in quite a short time but the game can still be played when one feels bored even if the quests have been completed.,Positive
"It's a great game overall. Very generous rewards, Genshin could never. Very nice gaming experience for people who like it chill. The only not so good thing is the slowly updated main story line. But at the same time we should look at Penacony to see that the wait was way worth it. The game takes its time and doesn't rush.",Positive
I love this game. I deleted it for a while beacuse I have no storage but I downloaded it again. Blade is too precious to lose,Positive
"Playing since launch, definitely a relaxing game events have been boring recently but got firefly and ruanmei in 30 pulls today so can't complain",Positive
"I would rate it 5 stars but there's something i would like to disclose. The loading screen is laggy, and the back of the train like disappeared for me. It was fine the first day, but the next day just made me crash out of the game. I can't tell if it's my phone or my wifi. I have read the system requirements and my phone matches them.",Negative
"I like that one too and it's one of my favorite games; the design, character's design, gameplay... everything is just perfect and the best thing is the STORY i just loved this game and was playing since release without having any issues, a comment can't describe my satisfaction. Thanks to the team for all their efforts ‚ô°",Positive
"I've been playing since version 1.0 and I honestly think this is the best gacha game I have ever played! The turn based combat is fun and the game is very free to play friendly, the world may not be open world but it's just as immersive. This game gives soo many free pulls and jades than Genshin and rerun banners are quite frequent. I also like that most events are permanent and can be played any time as well as the dailies being super easy and even easier with the new update. Overall a 10/10!",Positive
"Awesome turn based combat that captivated even someone like me who doesn't usually gets far into turn based games, stylish presentation, captivating world, and very good humor. I certainly recommend this one. As for the gacha-ness, it's much more generous than most other competitors, though since we're still in the early day of this title it might be harder to get pulls once you finish the main content. Still, you will not likely be left wanting for much.",Positive
"The game is awesome... on PC. Mobile feels clunky, and for some silly reason, turning down the graphics lowers the resolution of all text in the game. If I'm gonna play this game on a phone, I would appreciate it if the text didn't look like it came from an N64. If you're gonna play this awesome game, play it on PC. It'll probably give you a better experience, especially considering you can burn through content hella fast.",Negative
"Hoyo making it very clear they don't believe women fans exist, progressively turning all the meta characters to female and nerfing male characters into the dirt. If you're a woman, spend your time and money somewhere else.",Negative
I hate this game. Everything is connected and I lost everything in Genshin impact.üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ I do not appreciate verification all the time.,Negative
"Great game. Fun gameplay. Is still a gatcha game at its core. So you will be tempted to spend money here and there if you want a certain character. But ill admit that they give you plenty of free pulls throughout the game and the events along with future patches. Overall, you can still have fun if you wanna come in free to play. But you will have an easier time if you do spend money to get more character pulls or pull the same character several times to make them stronger.",Positive
Switch from Europe server to America ...it kept switching back. Would not start the game unless I accepted being on the Europe server.,Negative
"this game it's really good but the Loading screen it's really take a Long, Please I wanna play the Game! I really love this!",Positive
"OK I'm a long time follower of pretty much everything HOYOVERS and the combat system is realy eally fun especially with the free characters you get having a lot of Ins and outs that you can... let's say exploit, and God the dialog is absolutely freaking hilarious when it wants to be there are some random things that are way funnier than they have any right to be. 9/10",Positive
"One of the best games i've ever played. The graphics, ult animations, and cutscenes are just amazing. It's also pretty easy to obtain characters and warps, even as an f2p. One of the other reasons i like this game is probably because the game has some goofy lines, it just makes the game more complete for me.",Positive
"The game itself is really good, but I missed the Acheron banner :((((((",Positive
"Every game has its theme / style for it's art and character design. I tried the game after seeing a debut trailer of a character, ""Constance"". I fell in love with HSR because there is something majestic about the female character designs/waifus in this game. There is something memorizing about their appearances and personality. Aside from the characters, the story is fascinating and the combat is enjoyable. I like this game, and don't necessarily enjoy turn-based combat.",Positive
Beautiful graphics and cool gameplay. The best turn based action RPG I've played. And it's a mobile game!!!! That is sick. Mihoyo are gifting us with another beautiful game. The story is immersive and the characters are super cool. It may not be an open world like Genshin but it makes up for it by being more combat based. And you know: L+Ratio Genshin could never. üòÑ,Positive
"Enjoying it so far on PC and occasionally mobile. I'm more into the turn based combat so it really works for me. The story is alright as well, aside from the occasional strange translation mistakes. Granted, it can get a bit laggy and buggy on mobile.",Positive
"Still one of the best mobile games I'ved ever chosen to download. A massive step up from this company's previous gacha title (I won't name names) that had so many problems regarding it's story, pacing and character development. This game continues to improve with amazing trailers and characters. I hope this game continues to go far as the gameplay loop is way more forgiving. Also, ever since the ""trail-blaze power"" increase and resevoir, the game immediately became at least a 4.5/5* in my eyes.",Positive
"It's pretty good, the character designs are good, amd you really have to just kinda actually concentrate while fighting since it's a turn based game which some people may not prefer but some enemies are super powerful, it was kinda confusing at first for me but overall fun, I'm kinda low on motivation to play it though.",Positive
"I would give it a five star if it can work on integrated graphics and does not always not load in in my mobile. Is there anyway hoyoverse can program it to work on integrated graphics? I missed so much event and so much character and the entire penacony stories. I even missed their simple yet satisfying gameplay. I pretty sure others will also do the same review like this, so I really hope that you can make it work on integrated graphics again. (Would change my review after it works)",Negative
"I come back after 2.0 drops and every time I open the game it downloads files for a minute or two then freezes. Any input after that closes the game for no reason. Not sure why this is occurring as it never happened before 2.0. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, restarting AND shutting down my phone. Nothing worked. Pls fix :(",Negative
"I would rate it at least 4 stars; 5 stars if the RnG and pity system gets better - but until the mess is fixed - for now, I'll just give 2 stars for the game being awesome and has great music - gameplay experience has been ruined by the latest update for crashing all the time when entering a battle sequence on Android 14 (device: Oppo Reno 9 Pro Plus with the most recent ColorOS update) - never had that issue with the previous version of the game.",Negative
Love the gameplay it's not that open unlike genshin impact but the story was beautiful the characters are 10/10 and the events are so good. But there are some issues for me its overheating fast even though im using lowest graphics and when overheat occured so is my cutscene i cant watch the cutscene clearly because of that so please make it friendly to other device also im ( vivo y35 ),Positive
"Sometimes after loading during the end of a cutscene or battle, the game freezes/crashes in a black screen, resulting in having to restart the game. This is the only negative experience I've encountered, so i hope that it will be fixed at the earliest. But apart from the bug, it's a solid game.",Positive
"Absolutely beautiful game that continues to improve each patch. I never leave reviews, but Penacony has some of the best writing in any game I've ever played. Beautiful themes and messages and you can really tell the writers worked really hard! In terms of gameplay, HSR is a turn-based gacha that is generous in its rewards and difficulty without ever being ""too easy"". I tend to avoid gachas if I'm not playing it within a month of its release, but this game is 100% the exception!",Positive
"Really good game, story is excellent, but some quests are a bit boring and the unimportant ones should have a skip button. Characters are complex, designed well, and have fun kits. Also very f2p friendly. I am a f2p with e2 DHIL + all other meta units except Bronya and Jingliu. Needless to say, you can get the character you want. Its also not a time sink to 100% the map and chests are few but very rewarding, making life great. Genshin Could Never. Star Rail's Just Better.",Positive
"Great game but my God the amount of dialog is ridiculous and to have no skip button for it is just outrageous, but once you get past the endless dialog and get to play the game it's amazing. Just add a skip button, because I've literally put my phone down, for 30 minutes and there was still dialog going on at some points.",Positive
I only downloaded this through mistplay at first but I enjoyed it so much I downloaded it on my pc and the graphics are even better on there. At first I was very confused so many things being taught in the tut. But you get used to it the fights do drag out a bit sometimes but it typically doesn't bother me. Will top up eventually that's how you know I really enjoy the game:D,Positive
"I quite enjoy the game, and it runs well, but I'm experiencing semi-frequent crashes without any known cause on the Google Pixel 6. The game will randomly close during an action. EDIT: From 3 to 2 stars. The crashes keep getting more frequent, and has crashed multiple times upon starting the game.",Negative
"I really like this game, the characters and the main story is epic, plus the graphics was so stunning, I really love this game because, it has cute-attractive characters and the story. the thing is I don't like is the gacha, which is p2w, to make your character strong to get to the next chapter, I got stuck in some chapter and I have to grind. but it's okay, you can play f2p too, you just need to grind.",Positive
"The 2.0 and 2.1 updates are the best ones you've guys made so far. The story, characters, puzzles and environment are all top notch. Although I still dislike the relic system, I can overlook that for all the amazing work I've seen. Good job and I expect similar levels of quality on future patches.",Positive
"""Login error occurred, login later"" it says,when I want to log in, this happened in the morning so I tried to log in again nd again but it won't budge, so I tried to re-download it and it worked, but tonight it happened again I just restarted the game and it just happened,I'm tired re-downloading the game,cuz it takes so long to download,it's like, u need to re-download it every single time u want to play,nd seriously when is later?!, PLS I'M BEGGING U FIX IT.",Negative
"this game is great! I recommend you this game to the person who sees this! It has a great graphics, and the story plot is so exciting and mysterious! you can meet a lot of characters! And also obtain them, of course... But I recommend you to install it! It's completely worth it!!!",Positive
"My HSR first kept crashing since the newest update but I manage to fix it by changing the compatibility mode in settings to normal mode and turn off shadows, source: reddit. My device is Samsung S23 FE. I don't have any issue in my other devices. I recommend this game to people with its overall great experience and lore given to players. Great character designs and interesting MC. Generous rewards and this games respects its players' time. You can auto your dailies too",Positive
"Some new update has been making the game restart when trying to play the game. It happens a lot and even shows a unity engine error, I did reinstall the game. I can play but I mean the game suddenly quits when starting combat or just after starting after the train screen section. Happens like 2 out of 3 times. I have a Pixel 6 and it was running perfectly (sound and everything perfect) before one of the recent updates (Not the penacony one, I mean some little one done after it)",Negative
"I wanted to give this game a try but it kept crashing at the loading screen, and i cant even get past the 1st cutscene. It literally just freezes and close by itself. Luckilly, i could get it on my tablet but its quite hard for me to control it. I've tried to re-install it on my phone (S23 FE) but nothing works. I'll try to give it another shot later this day, and change my rating if it gets better.",Negative
"A F2P-friendly gacha game with a fun turn-based combat system. It offers a lot of characters with unique designs and personalities, alongside an ongoing plotline. Whether playing casually for the story or optimizing characters for challenges, it's fun both ways. However, story updates are somewhat slow and relic farming heavily relies on RNG. With that being said it's still a much better experience than many others on mobile devices",Positive
"The art and overall quality of the game are great... However, as someone who has failed 11 out of the 13 50/50 rates on limited banners, with just about all of them being hard pity (90 summons). All I can say is that it's a complete scam. Especially with how expensive premium currency is. It makes it so much worse if you are free to play. The limited daily resources and RNG heavy gear system also make it an extremely painful grind. It shouldn't take over 4 months to get one good piece of gear...",Negative
"I love this game SOOOO much. The Characters to the lore/main quest. I love how the current story is going. The graphics are also very nice! Overall, I haven't experienced any bug or downgrades in the game. The Auto-Play is also very convenient for grinding!",Positive
"I reinstalled the game because Ruan Mei's ult animation would freeze my phone every single time for like 10-30 seconds at a time at the part where it zooms out. I thought just getting rid of the bloat files like that would potentially fix it after the 2.0 update didn't. After reinstalling, however, the game now constantly crashes within a minute of me launching the game",Negative
"When I first started playing the game, I was skeptical because while I enjoyed Genshin Impact to an extent, it wasn't my type of game, and I'd had no experience with Honkai Impact 3rd. But I was convinced to try this one out due to the turn-based combat, being a Persona fan (that actually plays the games) I adore the gameplay and combat for Star Rail. The story is fantastic, and I've had a lump in my throat multiple times during it, especially so in the 2.0 update. Also Kafka is the best.",Positive
"""Switching Control Modes is prohibited during Tutorial. Please continue using controller or restart"" The game has poor design for controller at first start. Here I am using controller, and it pops up telling me to keep using controller and soft-locks me in a pop-up. Restart game, works for a bit, and then dialog again.",Negative
"this game is just really really good. I went into it with low expectations and it blew me away again and again and again. If you play through the main story and do nothing else and delete the app when you're done, you will have a great time, and the extra content is just bonus on top. This is what we thought the future of mobile games was going to be back in 2010.",Positive
"I re-downloaded the game and now I remember why I uninstalled. The constant fighting gets really tedious after a while. Almost all the extra ""fun"" content is just more fighting. No exploration, barely any story, just more watching the same animations over and over. Some of the fights drag out and the fighting starts to get really boring to watch/do. I really want to like the game, but almost every new thing is just ""grind and watch the same animations over and over again"".",Negative
"AMAZING game. Loving it so so much. The voice acting, the graphics, EVERYTHING. I'm dropping the stars, however, since the enjoyment wore off after Jarilo-VI, similar to genshin and mondstadt. Maybe tweak the difficulty of bosses or make a way to level characters better and I might return to the game. Love you star rail, but not right now.",Negative
"This game is great. There is a lot to do in the game, It may take some time to beat some missions in the later game, but you will get get there eventually. You just got to grind a little, I love this game. It has a great story, graphics, and characters, and it's fun. Now, I have spent a lot bit of money ($20) in the game, but you most definitely don't have to to progress. I don't know why, but I like this game significantly more than the other game called Genshin impact.",Positive
Amazing game. Interactive story. Fun mechanics. Beautiful designs. No stale metas. You can truly use whatever character you want to dominate. Free to play players can excel just as much as whales if you put in the effort. Can't even complain about bugs since there are basically none. 10/10 easy. I am totally hooked.,Positive
"Amazing game. This game has many events and quests await for us to explore. The lore is great, the gameplay itself is really fun. They provide us many rewards even if we just played the game for the first time. I especially like penacony update. This game is unbelievable. Genshin could never!",Positive
"There's a lot I would want to voice out my thoughts here, but it'd be for the best if I pinpoint 1 handy factor. It's precisely a rather pleasant feeling that I don't have to excessively be putting in a lot of labour work, since I could conveniently accumulate specific materials as any whole respective matches can be controlled by a literal AI? Splendid features, 10/10, manifestly holding all the aces that one could've been engrossed into spending a lot of expense just at the push of a button!",Positive
"Honestly, I've played almost all the Hoyoverse games at one point or another. This game is the first one where it feels like the Devs are actually making quality of life changes and generally care about players. Now, rolls can suck, and there is no real online play, but Id be lying if I said I haven't played this game for over 3k hours despite that. Characters are fantastic, The story is updating seemingly monthly, and genuinely laughed a few times too. Worth a play.",Positive
"Music on point, turn-based combat is fun/simple too easy to understand, impressive endgame content, decent characters, lack of a full character reset option that would cost about 60 stellar jades, we could pass their materials to other's would be nice, a bit buggy keeps closing me out when entering combat sometimes, would love to a proper relic loadout, hoping for a well deserved anniversary compensation for all the players who support this game, plz add a better hoyoverse login option on the PS",Positive
"Love this game a step up from Genshin Let start the negative first, a lot of tedious grinding for just 1 character especially when you reach high level and the boss battle for Ruan Mei story is seriously annoying like run max lvl character with good relica and light cone but still can't pass phase 2. About the positive one, Story was interesting,good gameplay,diverse side mode So far i don't face performance issue much but just sometimes the game just randomly freeze but it happens rarely",Positive
"Please add a skip button on quests scenes or talking scenes. Story lines are drawn out with unnecessary ""choice"" dialogues that have no effect on the outcome of the story and its even more tedious having to sit and watch characters stare into space saying nothing before moving on. Not very beginner friendly because as soon as you get through the few first quests, its downhill of overwhelming tasks back to back to back. Horrendously so. I was hoping itd be a little better than genshin. Its not.",Positive
It is a really good game. There are tons of quality of life features in this game and the rewards are amazing as well. There is a lot of endgame content in this game so you will never be bored. There animations are really smooth and each character and every character is very unique. You will have fun playing this game if you love turn based RPGs. Even if you do not you should still try it.,Positive
"This game is a straight 5-star!! My eyes are blessed with the beautiful art, unique character designs, fluid animations, exciting stories, and last but not least is the addicting game mechanic!! The Penacony update is AMAZINGG ‚ú© I love how the story is not always happy and sweet, but also have some deep meaning and bitter truth. The story always caught me off-guarded because there's many plot twist in this game!! Very much recommended, I cannot wait for the next update~!!",Positive
"Lapsed played here. After hearing about how much content has been added since I last played, I fully intended to reinstall HSR and play again. Sadly, the games crashes often without me even being able to leave the title screen. Please could you fix this, as I was very excited to jump back into this game.",Negative
"It's definitely a fun game. But it's not an online game, downloading 20k mb before even getting to play is insane for what this game is, besides getting to choose your gender, there's no customization what's so ever, not to mention if you exit the game while playing a character that isn't yours, not only will the game put you on a different mission next time you load in but it'll also make it impossible to switch quests. Farther than the snow is the quest I found this out on. Soon to be flop imo",Negative
"I'm giving this 3 stars because of being unplayable when using mobile data. I know the game will need a strong WiFi connection. But it's frustrating when you want to play the game outside with data. But it won't let you play. And it keeps giving out the error 1001_1, I have tried to fix from what I've looked up on but it still wouldn't load/play",Negative
"It's an 10/10 game to me, the story is great the character designs are really cool and overall gameplay is also pretty good but the only problem that i have is pure fiction i hate that game mode,why? Because my game lages so heard in that game mode that it crash, i know that my device is pretty weak but it's always only this game mode that crashes my game and I'm fed up with it",Positive
"Love this game, the characters are designed so well and the storyline is amazing. The elements/characters powers visuals are so cool and it's not hard to farm and it's pretty easy to get rewards. The events are very fun and gives many rewards. Highly recommend.",Positive
"Yeah it's not bad, it suffers from the fact that you get stuck often with enemies overpowering you, and optimization as well as the massive amount of storage it takes up is an issue, game runs just pretty poorly, both on Mobile and PC (from experience) Worth a try if you can run it i guess though",Positive
"obsessed with this game and looks like it isn't going to go away any time soon. Can't wait for the next trailblaze mission, but I do wish that the enemies from the calyxes gave more drops. I don't wanna fight four Silvermane dudes just to get one drop.",Positive
"EDIT: There are improvements to be made. I like the turn base gameplay. However, as a gacha, their pull rates are as bad as the rest of their games unless you spend money. Recently, many enemies have bs moves and skills. Drop rates for gear with good stats are still lacking. After the recent update, my game crashes on mobile a lot.",Negative
"A comfort game at this point, love what they did with it and how it evolved as it grew. Been here since the release and couldn't enjoy it more",Positive
"Used to love the game and play it daily for about 6 months. I have now come back after 5 months, but the game keeps crashing on the title screen while trying to download it. I've tried dozens of times. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. It would run quite smoothly before, but now I can't even access the game.",Negative
"Already played the game it's fantastic the story, cg is good. But there a bug if you playing the game on Android and open the setting and change the reflection to high in the city it will change everything (except people) into white it will change to normal if you set it to low.",Positive
"Honestly, this game is *okay*. It could absolutely be worse, but the voice acting and sound effects get very overstimulating after a short period (I turned 'em off). Additionally, the story (for me, anyways) was really hard to follow, and for Herta's 'simulation' when you get dialogue, reading it all just feels like a chore. Personally, I don't enjoy the turn-based combat. However, HSR has an amazingly short game load time compared to Genshin. Overall (as a new player), I've got mixed feelings.",Negative
New update sucks! My game stucks randomly when I launch ultimates. I need to close the game and start the fight over again making It impossible to end some fights. This never happened before the update. I tried reinstalling and lowering the graphics but as of now it's still freezing. And how come we can't delete other language voice-overs and past quest residuals?,Negative
The game is very Fun to play! What's better is the customer service they respond very quickly to help with your acc!! Lost the email to your Honkai: Starrail acc? Email them and expect a quick response!!!,Positive
"As of writing this review, 2.1 is upon us and Acheron is releasing soon. This game takes all the good parts of HI3 and Genshin, throws them together, upgrades it by a large factor, then slaps on a constant stream of content. You can never easily get bored even when grinding, because auto battle. And the generosity of the devs is off the charts. But the best part of the game? The wholesome and heartwarming adventure that is the story. (Quoting ÁÉßÈ∏°Â§ßÂì• for that last line hehe).",Positive
Amazing graphicsüëå good story best turn based game I've played but isk if a glitch or something I messed up but in the first planet the frozen one I was in the underground and logged off and now I can't do anything besides run around and interact with stuff and the game won't point me anywhere pleaseüôè look to see if is a glitch,Positive
"One of those people with a new Samsung phone that keeps crashing after the patch. Rating a one star just so this gets fixed ASAP. Some people apparently can't even play anymore. I can still play just fine, but now have random crashes that I never experienced before. So it's definitely something on the devs end they need to look into.",Negative
The lore itself is just amazing! The characters look beautiful and I don't think any of them are overly sexualized they are cover how they fit their characters. Only some issues of bugs freezing but just put it on very low and it will be good to go!,Positive
"The games a lot of fun and the characters feel unique to play. The only downside is the amount of energy you get to farm relics and trace materials is really low. Farming the materials takes ages, even at the heightest tier doing the 6 runs, you mostly just get 1 of the high grade you want.",Positive
"the game is so good but i always have problems with the cutscenes, everytime cinematic cutscenes appears it always framedrops so hard, so it's hard to enjoy the story. On a lower end device this isn't very good. So i hope there's a solution for this!",Negative
"Great game, first locking you to watch bad story is the most fun part, you can't skip the story even the story have 0 impect to game play other then make you wanna do rolls for characters. Second, farming for relics is fun as well, always get def and HP relics is super rewarding, peak game play. Lastly, every time a new event comes out, just use the trail character with auto farm, easily get the max reward that's fun aswell.",Positive
"Nice, but frequently as a skill-less player, i need of low-lvl button as in Genshin, or more trial characters as in HI3 to accomplish the main story",Positive
"Graphics are insanely good, but you don't customize your character off the bat, the story is wonky from the get go, it's not backbone/controller supported, the turn based battle system is confusing, and it seems that it's just sexually charged to draw in a one dimensional audience...",Negative
"Pretty good characters and gameplay. One issue though. I tried doing some updates or whatever, but my phone rebooted after around five minutes. Tried again, maybe just a coincidence. Reboot. It rebooted 5 times within the span of about seven minutes. I know it was specifically this download that triggered the reboot, since I stopped trying and now my phone is fine. Unfortunately I have to uninstall since now it's unplayable. It was a really good game though!",Negative
"Edit* Perfect thank you!!!! That solution worked I've played this game for ages on my phone, but when it did its last update, the app just constantly crashes, I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling but it's just doing the same thing. It's a shame because this is a really good game",Positive
"Loving the game. My only suggestion is to increase the energy from 180-220 so people can farm more as well as increase the speed of the energy recharge. Also, the auto system is missing in some parts. The number of runs could also be increased from 1 -6, to how much energy we have which makes better use of our energy. The summing could be split from units to cards, please. The login needs to be in the game not on the website please fix this. A reset option for characters would be nice",Positive
"Alroght now I'm getting annoyed, since the 2.0 update now I can't do anything in the game now, As soon as I enter the game amd press 1 button it just crashes and closes the game I have tried again and again always the same, crashing. Now I'm really annoyed as well it's still not fixed even after over a month, i have deleted the game and reinstalled and still everytime after 1 minute it freezes and crashes can't even download the game properly either",Negative
Entertaining turn-based RPG with some exploration. Narratively uneven due to the need to make references to irl and memes every chance it gets. Has an auto-battle system for when the combat eventually gets repetitive and dull.,Positive
"I didn't expect to actually like this game as much as I do. I usually don't go for story based games, but this one is amazing. I love the fighting style and how the camera is fixed and angled. The voice acting is phenomenal!! Some of the puzzles can be a little hard but fun nonetheless.",Positive
"Most likely thr best Gacha game I've ever played. The story for this game is absolutely fantastic, it's not open world but it does have some aspects to it. The turn based game is also quite fun. Going through the story quests is really fun!! There is soooo many events ones that are permanent and those that come and go. And with the new update of penacony there is more content in the game. I've never had this much fun in a gacha game :D",Positive
"I have played this game alot And that's why I give it 5 stars... but the problem with the game is that it is optimized on the mobile phone... Ganshin in the highest graphics does not heat up the phone as much as the medium of this game... My phone can easily play Honkai at 60 frames and It runs with the highest graphics, but the temperature is more than 50 degrees, which is scary, and I have to play 30 frames and medium, which is still 45 degrees.",Positive
"I love the game so much all the characters are so pretty and the interactions in the game are fun too along with the story, though the only issue I have is the languages file whenever the new update is here for some reason the language files I had downloaded gets deleted and I have to re-download them again. It would be great if you could fix it other than that I don't have any issues. The story is fun too and this is my first ever turn based game so I'm not disappointed at the least.",Positive
"This game is loads better compared to genshin and Honkai 3rd. Gathering upgrade materials, the auto mode, everything is smooth and enjoyable. We don't need to grind a lot to upgrade characters, lightcones and such. Very good! I recommend upping the chances of getting a 5 star though.",Positive
"I honestly love the game. It's entertaining and balanced. There isn't any PVP so you can't have griefing like you would for Genshin Impact, the characters, while some are ""stronger"" nearly every character can do a lot of damage. Farming is also pretty easy. You can basically get whatever you want in it if you work hard enough for it. The graphics of it are so good!! They have plenty of stories and have made so many quality of-life changes and it's only been out for a year!",Positive
"In an alternate reality where this game was released as a traditional RPG, it's one the most stylish I've ever played. Truly something that pays respects to the Sci-Fi genre in general, as well as specifically to the games, movies and shows that it's calling back to. But since we live in this reality, this is a gacha game. Eventually you will roll, and then you will remember your game was made by Mihoyo...",Negative
"i love this game & its devs i feel so blessed playing it. there's always so many quality of life updates every patch/version, side quests r extremely funny or deeply emotional, love npcs, each of the planets are beautiful, main story very good (except the xianzhou luofu, sadly wasted potential), events r rewarding and entertaining, character & visual design is PEAK (sometimes repetitive but is forgiven because effects r so good) and so much more, i actually enjoy combat, fun endgame content!! 10",Positive
"I agree that they give greater rewards than genshin could ever do. From the story and characters, almost everything is top tier. The only issue I got is the ‚Äútoo many requests, try again later‚Äú issue with this game. I already encountered this issue with all (6) of may accounts. The first account had already been resolved but, the other 5 no. While the rewards are tempting, it's simply not worth it if you're just gonna lose it. Never encountered this in genshin before, even when I had 8 accs.",Negative
"Great Game, 2 stand users ( Clara and Jingyuan ) and a funny but interesting storyline. Turn based game could be improved a bit, but it's decent for a game that is new. I also love how unhinged some of the characters are during the story. Lastly, man those achievement names are funny.",Positive
"The game is wonderful but the reason I'm giving it a one-star review is that when I open the game, most things are fine but the entire world just goes blank..? Its pitch black and only entities such as certain objects and characters load. The walls and buildings aren't visibly there but I can see them on the map and I don't glitch into walls or anything. Please fix it or give me some suggestions. Xx",Negative
"I've been playing the game since the very first day and everything was fine. after the release of the new patch, the game stopped working altogether. it hangs for long minutes, and then when I tap on the screen, it just crashes out of the app. the main disappointment in recent years",Negative
Experiencing quite few crashes after 2.0 updates but I definitely like it. One of the best Online RPG that is worth a GEM and worth to keep because IT IS FRIENDLY TO PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO TOP-UP and DOES NOT REQUIRE TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME to complete dailies. Definitely recommended to gamers ‚ù§Ô∏è,Positive
"How come that a different team in the same company can get things so right in comparison? HSR has the best quality of life feel I've ever seen in any game, frankly. The story is amazing and thrilling, and the dialogue doesn't feel blown up. The rewards feel satisfying, and being able to go back to ""expired"" events is so lovely. The Genshin team should take some notes...",Positive
"best gacha ive ever played, and I've tried quite a few. honkai sinks it's hooks in with great turn based combat and deceptively complex team building. it is very easy to get a few weeks of quality gaming out of this because the resources are very generous throughout the story. Even close to end game I'm enjoying logging in for dailies and weeklies. Thx Hoyo for a banger.",Positive
"Beautiful music and voice acting. Great team building, art, characters, and story. The only thing keeping this from being my main mobile game is the constant 1001_3 error code whenever I try to play without wifi even with 5G connection at over 20mps. Reinstalling does nothing. Please solve this.",Positive
"I LOVE this game. It's a turn based rpg that's limited compared to Genshin Impact, but I think that's what I like about it (think Final Fantasy X vs Final Fantasy XII). The art is beautiful, there are endless quests, and I haven't had to spend a dime to make in game progress.",Positive
"Playing through Belobog was genuinely some of the most fun I've had in gaming. The Xianzhou ruined a lot of the fun for me, I played before penacony was out and so I hit the end game pretty fast. The only thing I get hype for anymore is to make my teams better but eventually that'll end and after that I don't know why I'll keep playing the game. If there's one thing I can suggest, Hold off on getting the game. The longer you wait the more content you'll be able to enjoy without maxing out.",Negative
"genshin runs unbelievably smoothly on my phone despite having nearly 30gb space.. . but this game, the log in screen and whenever I ran into cutscenes the frame would go soo low along with inaudible sound (even on low setting). please can you fix it? edit: Penacony is so peak, I changed my device just to play this game.",Positive
"5 stars for such a simple Turn-based JRPG - Gacha game. Animation and graphics are very good and fit well for the rest of Hoyoverse. Game combat is fine, basic, and simple. Higher level combat is not that hard to grasp and understand. The summon is where it falls off a little as you can summon 20 times and only get one or two 5-star units. You need to focus on either unit or vision card unless you go whale. The F2P is general good and should be able to finish with the units given.",Positive
"Honestly downloaded due to the music in the ads and gave it a go, honestly one of the best mobile gacha games there is especially right now, the game throws so much f2p options and in game currency very unlikely youll be bored or behind in the gameplay, time investment needed to get going but between the music, story. characters, combat ( i enjoy turn based) and the design/aesthetic of the game, for a game on MOBILE is insane. Oh and Argenti is husband.",Positive
"Beautiful game... Beautiful storyline, soundtrack and everything but one thing that bug me the most is whenever I was in cutscenes like the fight with cocolia the audio just suddenly not clear and very like a static sound I even try using earphone/earbud but the static sound is still in the cutscenes I really want to enjoy the game and the story but I can't really immersed myself during those cutscenes",Positive
I love this game so much. I am disabled part of the community. I love this game! And the boss fights are hard but I either have to suffer and wait to level up and get the things I need or play the game. Love the story lines. Love the adventuring and I love playing as the characters. And I'm happy for who I am. I would sponsor this game with pictures and get people interested. And I'm just excited for more updates that they have and more in stored stories and fun to behold Aventure . ^~^,Positive
"Well I have played Honkai Star Rail for a year now and can say that the story, game play and side quests are peak. The game is way more manageable in terms of farming and pieces (A.K.A relics). The updates and generosity of the devs is great and with every new event, game mode or mini game you get tons of rewards. I would say the game is quite F2P friendly (as an F2P) The story is amazingly thrilling and exciting along with the characters they present. Plus there are a ton of guides to help you",Positive
"Game used to work fine, but since the 2.0 update the game freezes when trying to update then crashes. Tried reinstalling the game and still having issues. This isn't a phone issue as all other games work and I have plenty of space. Please fix this as I can't play at all.",Negative
"Just find this game to be incredible to look at but a slog to play. Graphics and voice acting is top however playing the game is really boring. The rates are extremely low for new characters making gacha pulls unexciting and prices are extremely expensive. You end up using the same team with the same abilities and no real room for anything else and because of how limited the actions are, you do the same thing over and over again.",Negative
"I've been playing ever since this game came out, and honestly, hands down the best game I have ever played. I love the story, puzzles and how it's kind of easy to get stellar jades (unless you completed everything like me) I also absolutely love Aventurine and Penacony it's so fun, especially the puzzles. Keep up the good work hoyo ü´∂",Positive
"This game is great! The story is very fun and the characters are beautiful to look at. The constant events and diffrent game modes add a lot more content with generous rewards. This game by far is one I would hardly get tired of playing. If you needed a game with great rpg combat and good story, this game is for you.",Positive
This game is amazing but the events is not for starting player because it's all in the new map and you need to do a very long quest because of traiblaze level cap for certain quests its hard to finish all quest to get to play the events litteraly you need to wait for a few days or even a week to finish unlike genshin that there is a button to skip the other quest and go straight for the event,Negative
"It's one of the most amazing games I play. The graphics and the characters is amazing too, what I like about this is that the story line and rewards is catching for me, it got addictive because of the story line and the rewards you will get when you finish a mission and level up your TB.",Positive
"After playing since release I've really gotta say that this is the best think the Honkai team has ever put out. There is nothing in the reviews that can explain to you how good the game is, so honestly just try it out. It's a bit slow in the beginning of the story, but the second you get to the first story location it just breezes by. My only issues are a SEVERE lack of spellchecking (alot of dialog is very messy) as well as your dialog choices never seem to match when you select.",Positive
"First of all I lost my save file after an update, That is unacceptable. But any how here is the review. The game jumps strait in with zero introduction to the characters and setting, with no build up at all, which is an absolute must in any rpg! The game looked good but feels like it's made for slow people. Its to simple, there is no wonder of what too do or where to go next, the combat is pretty strait forward and repetitive. I much perfer the turn based combat of a game like black clover M.",Negative
I have a big issue in this game. It's just that I CAN'T LOG IN no matter how many times I tried it's getting frustrating and annoying. My internet is GOOD but the only app that doesn't work is HSR. I only played it ONCE now I can't log back in no more it's annoying and making me furious.,Negative
"It's a great game but there's a lot of things I hate. Lack of ability to interact with friend other than borrowing charecters sucks. The amount of storage it takes up is horrible to -- his game, like genshin, should not be marketed as a mobile game if mobile cellphones can't have it. I installed this because he shin got too big for my phone, and it's even starting to get too big for my PlayStation. Now, at only 2.0, this game is too big -- AND unavailable on any other device I own.",Negative
"The game is good but in the long run it's getting the vibe as ""Pay to win"" old characters are getting useless and new characters are overpowered at the same time they're getting harder to get, example you get one of the newer character is kinda useless without it's lightcone, so you won't enjoy this game entirely if you won't spend a huge amount of money in this game",Negative
"I really love this game and I started to play it since the game server opens. But there is a bug in my game: I cant play level IV in the Spheroid level that's in the Hanu's prison break. When I enter the Spheroid, my game will crash and it'll be stuck in the screen. It still works like this if I force stop the game in the phone settings. Hoyo please fix this bug soon.",Positive
"Didn't play it for a long time, after wanting to play again I had to download 14 GB (And there's no problem) until when i finished downloading and want to open it, It's crashed several times and I don't know why, even though I still have a lot of memory and I just bought my phone. Edit : Finally it didn't crash, but my previous account disappeared when I logged in (more likey they created me a new account with my old Gmail), and i forget my account name (IM so dumb)",Negative
"The game's phenomenal, just incredible, but performance is not great at all, idk why cause Genshin Impact runs on my phone with ease, and it seems more demanding than Star Rail, and after this last update performance seems to be even worse, my phone isn't even that weak, it's a Snapdragon 4 Gen 2, I really like the game but it's a shame it runs this badly on my phone.",Negative
"I love this game it has lots of interesting characters, great combat mechanics and it's not too expensive to have characters you want",Positive
"Another fantastic game by Hoyoverse. Amazing cutscenes and open world exploration. The story and music are amazing. Remember that this IS a free game. Take your time and enjoy the turn based gameplay. With auto mode and 2x speed, you can farm for characters ascensions, talents and lightcones upgrades while doing other work!",Positive
"Started playing since day 2 and a lot has improved! Like the 240 trailblaze power and the fact that there's overflow (Genshin could never). In the beginning, I didn't like the turn-based combat, now I love it! (all thanks to the auto combat). I actually enjoy playing hsr now, in comparison to Genshin where I often feel pressured to play everyday",Positive
I honestly love this game it has a really great stories and pretty characters but the only thing that annoys me is that every time I enter a combat it just keeps crashing ever since the penacony update I don't know if that's just my phone but I'm not even full storage or anything but it just keep crashing man,Positive
"The quality here is awful if you play on phone, the environment and map won't load correctly. The enemies are harder than you might think, so you are forced to build characters. However, I enjoy the game. The characters are nice and the game is generous. Not the biggest fan of turn based games, but this one is good. Would recommend. I kinda wish they would co-op, but at the same time, I'm not sure if it will make sense.",Positive
"A great game made by the very same developers of Genshin Impact. I just kinda wished they had reduced the size of the app, 20+ GB for a game that's isn't even 1 year old is really overkill. Other than that, great story, great characters, and great gameplay.",Positive
"I wish I could rate this higher. The gameplay is a bit vanilla, but so what? The lore is deep, the story is good, and the visuals and soundtrack are breathtakingly beautiful. If you're looking for a total experience rather than a simple game, look no further.",Positive
"Freezes and crashing when loading screens whether it's opening doors or getting into battles. Fun experience though an characters / gameplay overall is nice like a star ocean feel , with an update I will continue to play .",Negative
"I love this game a lot! The story and characters are really captivating, the rewards are pretty generous, and the gameplay never really bores me. Looking forward to what the star rail team brings during their second year!",Positive
"I once played it and deleted this game (which I regret).now I tried it again and it's now one of my favorite games,and it's actually pretty good (voices,characters, graphics, etc..)it's been 3 days now that I play this game and got already 10 characters, they're not very much but it surprises me because in genshin impact it isn't so easy, I hope y'all find this useful and try this game.",Positive
"Honestly this game is amazing, much better than Genshin. Everything that made me dislike Genshin? Fixed here. I thought I wouldn't like the turn-based combat so I didn't download it originally but I was really surprised. Got Dan Heng ‚Ä¢ Imbibitor Lunae on my first limited 10-pull, which is really nice! It definitely feels like you have more luck with getting 5 stars. I got Bronya's light cone within 30 pulls on standard. The characters also look really cool, so major plus! I highly recommend.",Positive
"Really a great game with amazing storyline. Those who are giving 1 star are mostly who can't read ""Turn Based RPG"" and expect it to be like Genshin. Overall game is really fun and enjoyable. Worth 4 star now since with Penacony update lots of new bugs have arrived. Game crashed while entering in battle and it's kinda annoying. ‚≠ê",Positive
"great game with great gameplay and visual, the story is great aswell. However, the bosses in the game are too frustrating. Even with the best character and best builds, they barely do any damage to the boss.",Negative
"If you don't want lag or your storage getting high don't download this game because it requires 2 updates on downloading resources for ""better experience"" your storage ain't going to look pretty after you download this game but if you want a turn based action game this is for you unless your willing to take the risk it's laggy in cut scenes for those mobile player's",Negative
"Gets boring fast. MC lacks a voice actor. Menus are an overcomplicated maze, so you can't find anything. Battles can often take 20 to 30 minutes (and are only possible with two healers constantly healing). Characters are constantly locked behind bs like account level and story progress, keeping you too weak to do anything. These need to be fixed right away. The amount of dialog is excruciatingly painful and there is no way to skip any of it. Way too much talking and too little playing.",Negative
"I want to play this game but I wish there would be a skip button to quests that are not related to the main story. Moreover, I hate the fact that these relics are so random. Its frustrating. I want to level up my characters but I can't because I have to farm good relics for the other characters. Also, the powercreep is crazy. I feel like some of the old characters are becoming useless.",Negative
"The game is alright. The story is decent at times. They really stayed too safe on the turn based combat, making it basically turn based genshin, but less freedom of movement. The music is mostly garbage in the beginning, but it gets better later. The events have decent rewards, but the mediocre 50/50 gacha makes it seem like nothing; I rarely got what I wanted, killing any motivation. The lack of QOL sweeping makes the game a slog too. Decided to drop the game again while being F2P, got bored.",Negative
"They fixed the issue with the game crashing when entering battles, but there is a new issue with the game crashing during battles. It happened when I was in Simulated Universe, I casted my ultimate, but the game froze. I hope they fix this.",Positive
"Looks good but all toxic. Most offline. Should allow full online (such as WoW,) add gamepad/keyboard/mous support. Unigine, good visuals. Lots of good maps. Should allow to construct your own stuff, and interface mods (such as WoW), and custom maps. Could add OpenLlama1/Palm2 to NPCs for conversations? Found on Google Play, so not too bad versus most. Should do procedural algos, 17GB woulda shrunk to 1 or 2.",Negative
"I like plsying HSR, but what annoys me is the ressource caps and the need for daily logins. Why not create a monthly cap and not this FOMO trash. Relics (Equipment) for the characters are horrible to farm. Worse than Genshin. The rewards are decent, but with so many new characters it doesn't feel that great. There is nothing to do on most days other than to login for 5 minutes. Get rid of daily login, you'll most likely end up with higher player retention.",Negative
"The game it self is amazing to play , you can say it quite decent to be played. But there is problem i notice with this game, the game heat up phone a lot and i kind of surprised because it make my phone heat up really HOT. I'm using xiaomi note 9 pro and in this term of matter this kind of trouble shouldn't happens. So it make me kind of sad here.. it only took few minutes play then this happened. I've play other game like gensin impact for hour but my phone not get heating Up.",Negative
"Fun turn based rpg enjoying the story, characters, and the turn based combat. Has simmler levelling systems and ui as genshin, but levelling character isn't as grindy. I'd say everything the game borrowed from genshin has been improved. it's just whether you enjoy turn based combat or not.",Positive
"MAKE SUNDAY PLAYABLE, PLEASE! I'M BEGGING. HE'S SO PRETTY.. I'M GOING INSANE! I NEED TO SEE HIS PRETTY FACE WHENEVER I OPEN THE GAME!! I'M NOT JOKING I ACTUALLY NEED HIM TO BE A PLAYABLE 5 STAR. IF THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE THEN THERE'S NO POINT IN ME PLAYING ANYMORE.. (Giving 5 star review if he come home :3)",Negative
Hands down the best mobile game overall or the best mobile rpg. The characters all look unique and interesting and the graphics are beautiful. The only con is probably the gacha but I have noticed that it's not that hard to get good characters from them and you get a lot of pulls for free. 10/10.,Positive
This is game is one of the best mobile games ever released this is because of its free to play friendliness and easy to understand mechanics,Positive
"Well sometimes I wish I could skip the CG or Dialogue part, so annoying especially when you have busy day. Just imagine to finish 1 mission mostly takes hours with less fighting part (usually once). I think some dialogue part from side mission is unimportant and worth skipping.",Negative
I really love this game! Especially on MOBILE it has many chararcters and missions which are really interesting the BEST thing is that it's not lagging and it's really smooth plus it has many rewards it's the best in My opinion it also has many activities to do it's like you can never stop playing and I hope who ever is reading this gets to experience it too.üòÅ,Positive
"After playing the game for 24h in total. I closed it and went to bed. Next morning, I wake up, boot it up and I'm at the start of the game. All my characters gone and all the starter stuff gone. It also says the 3 basic characters are trial. I don't know if it only happened to me, but I do know I won't install again.",Negative
I liked Honkai Star rail I started playing Since November 2023 I like they events and Quest they are very easy to complete and not hard and puzzles are easy to and they give Great Rewards and Saves my times because I do my homework and autoplay HSR and even while I do my house works and I suggest in the future is game will be better but the Problems is that's sometimes lags and sometimes bugs but that not big issues but I enjoy the game very much anyways.,Positive
"The game is good... Especially at the beginning... But as it progresses... It becomes too hard and unbearable to continue even if all my characters are all leveled up... There's no way I can finish all these quests because I get stuck and can't complete the quests involving combat without upgrading my characters even more and I can't upgrade my characters because of insufficient items, I grew tired with this and I'll delete it anyway.",Negative
"I would like to be able to play this game, it looks really nice but I can't even get to play it, it keeps crashing and I'm using Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. According to other reviews they made some new patch which started crashing everyone, hope this gets fixed so I can start the game",Negative
"This game is super generous and rewarding for to its longer term player base. The devs really love this game and it shows with the quality of the story and writing and the funny quirks, references, and Easter eggs that are littered about. Every update brings new content and quality of life features and this new recent update for Penacony is nothing short of breathtaking. 5 stars for really making me feel like my time in this game is being rewarded and recognized.",Positive
"I love it,but it takes up so much space on my phone. My phone can hold up to 64 GB, and I was only able to have about 2 other games with this one. I had to uninstall it for a bit, and my phone went from 98% storage used to 58% üíÄ The game itself is really good tho, I can understand why it takes so much space, but it's annoying.",Negative
"I really liked this game because of the turn based game style and the progression in this game is simple but feels a bit repetitive but I don't know, that's the point of the game. I had to edit this review just to say the soundtracks are amazing",Positive
I've been playing this game like 8 months now good graphics good story I'm really love it the only problem is the out content like when I'm finished all the events get all the chest anq quest and so on I don't feel like playing since the lack of content so I was hoping to bring more so I can play more often and not once a week,Positive
"5-star review for Honkai Star Rail! I love this game very much, it's genuinely one of my favorites. I never imagined I would get hooked to it. The character designs are anime style, top notch. The animations and audio is so damn good. I couldn't ask for a even better game to enjoy on the go. Good job and keep up the good work!!!",Positive
"Everything about the game is great except for having garbage stories with bad writing that lack ground on common sense and others relationship with trailblazer is more forced than genuine, and the two new limited 5* banners every 42 days, how are some of these not in the standard banner already? That said, this game has one of the best endgame and fastest daily. The relic tho need a huge improvement given the pace of new 5* and months it would take for somebody to build just a single character.",Negative
"Thank god finally move from super boring xuanzhou, about to quit if there is no new map, penacony is new refreshment, hopefully next is location based on japan, please no more chinse style character, the are too many. jingyuan jingliu tingyun wen siqy/wen siling qingcue somehow really confusing and real let down, better with western fantasy name like kafka, argenti, black swan, serval etc, and why update always that big for game like this, so many game w better graphics/story with smaller update",Positive
I play this game on ps5 and mobile. I love everything about this game except the drop rates of the banner exclusive 5 star hero. It takes so many tries for me to succeed. Like so I've totally missed on getting Ruan mei even after doing 18 times the 10x pull. I even gave up on the game after that. That's why 4 stars,Positive
"You don't have to spend a dime to get characters. There's plenty of free in game currency that you get by completing story content/events. And those refresh every 3 weeks after every character banner event ends, a new one starts. If you're a f2p the hardest thing in this game is learning to have self control and not give in to buying every character that comes out. Only buy what character or character weapon you really want. Otherwise you won't get far with your team comp. This is a team game.",Positive
"Graphics, gameplay, story is all very good. 3 stars because the game does not support controller like Genshin Impact and it cost way too much to try for those 5 star characters and weapons. Furthermore it's just a single player game.",Negative
"The game was fine, I think, but I just cant stop thinking about how bad the characters look . It's all just boring to look at. Yes, they looks pretty, but they're all the same. Literally all of them look. The. Same. You cant just give the characters different hair and faces and expect them to look Interesting in a lineup. The body shapes, the shape language, even the poses are monotonous. The clothing tells no story. and when you look at them all, they all blend Into some pale skinned blob.",Negative
"One of the best gacha games I've played. Gameplay is limited in a sense, leaving most of the challenge up to tactics and strategy. Animations and aesthetics are visually amazing. Story is well-written, and voice acting performances are amazing.",Positive
"One of the best turn-based games I have ever played so far, the only complaint I really have is the lack of option to opt out of an ultimate. Other than that, I don't have many issues with the game, it's designed very well and I don't feel the same issues I've had with Genshin. Hope that HSR continues to thrive!",Positive
"Really good plot and battle mechanic, naturally the game has the gacha system, but if you don't want to use it you can play with basic characters and enjoy it, for me this title is the first game which give the console experience and the same time this is the game for smartphone",Positive
"The game has a good story so far. The controllers are quite simple and it's great because you can easily perform well on a mobile phone. The only thing I dislike is the amount of new content added is a bit slow paced, otherwise it good game so far.",Positive
"This is an amazing experience, the story and graphics are amazing. The only thing to complain about is that it takes up a lot of storage. Although, my phone can run this and Genshin Impact smoothly, and it used to be my grandmother's!",Positive
"I'm experiencing many bugs. 1. The starting screen for some reason the screen pauses and lags 2. Within just 5 minutes I logged in the game it closes for no reason even when my wifi is good 3. When I join the game, the map glitches and the ground becomes invisible",Negative
I'm a genshin impact player... I started HSR as rewards are pretty good compared to genshin... Yup but still there is a room to improvement when it comes to story little less engaging... I know I feel this way coz I'm from genshin whose storyline and lore is the greatest strength... Not worse or anything but still can be improved a lot... Otherwise it's awesome and please if possible share some of your rewarding sense to genshin üòÇi would stopped playing that long ago if not for their story,Positive
"I love this game and It's definitely better than Genshin Impact, being a turn-based rpg I thought It would not be interesting but as I continued to play and gave it a chance, I wasn't disappointed. I started following the story and It is pretty good and works out. The gacha element is very rewarding and frequent updates with various events that can provide you with free stellar jades (in-game currency for wishes) and not to forget the recent game of the year win prize, Dr. Ratio being FREE.",Positive
"This is a great game for people who enjoy playing gacha games & jrpgs. The game has an engaging gameplay loop for people who want to play for a few minutes or a few hours a day. The story itself has melancholic, witty, and serious elements to it. I personally believe that this game is the best rpg you can play on mobile and it may be the best game that Hoyo has put out so far. As of 2.0 the game is still less than a year old. Firefly made me fall in love again and I'm waiting for more.",Positive
"Honestly I think this game is better than genshin... In all honesty I have played genshin before but it hasn't been able to beat HSR in my opinion. It has great graphics, variety of characters like genshin, and lots of things to farm for and the story is long but fun. You get so many different rewards and a lot of rewards as well. Like for the 1yr anniversary 30 free wishes, more relics, planar ornaments, trace and many more. In my opinion this HSR beats genshin. What do yall think?",Positive
"This is how a gatcha should work. There's a great balance of grinding and free stuff to make spending money feel unnecessary, but without making it feel horrible. The story so far is gripping and fun, especially for Impact 3rd players. If you're a Genshin Impact player, there seems to be no connection besides the one obvious thing. Square Enix should take notes for Ever Crisis.",Positive
"Love, love, love the game. The only thing I couldn't get into was the combat style. I would prefer something much more like genshin's fighting style. Love the game and absolutely adore the character designs, but not the fighting. Would recommend if you like turn based game play.",Positive
I have to leave this review because of Penacony. Beautiful art deco and retro futuristic design. The mini games are cute and fun. The game is worth it just for it. The devs are also really generous when it comes to free to play gameplay.,Positive
"game is good however it is really stressful to grind for your characters and make them stronger because of the stupid rng system when getting relics. also please give us more trailblaze power or make it recharge faster, I don't want to wait a day for it to recharge and then use it up within under 5 minutes. it is absolutely outrageous.",Negative
Download software extra files stop and refuse to restart if phone goes to lock screen or is interupted in any way forcing you to restart the app and also if this happens in game as well say you get a phone call it it's locks all touchscreen features again forcing a restart of app. Other games don't have this issue as you know being a game on the phone 99% of devs account for this. So needless to say I'm just uninstalling and playing/paying for something else that works all the time.,Negative
it's a great game. sure there are some bugs here and there it gets patched in the next patch or given a quick fix. my only gripe is that size gets larger with each major update and I get that but can't it get condensed? it's 12gb of data now for almost every update at some point I won't be able to download any future update for the game,Positive
"I love this game but I have to deinstall and install the game everytime I leave the game for an hour or two because it says ""too many requests please try again later"" when I try to log in on my second account. Logging in on my main works completely fine so I don't get what the problem is.",Positive
"I don't have any issues about graphic, animation and storyline but this game is very difficult to play for a f2p person. Leveling characters is very annoying when there are too many items for farming only for one character. relics are also mostly garbage. the enemies are also not balanced with the world level especially the boss. it feels like punching wall with empty hands even though it's weakness break.it's a shame it's a good game but unbalanced unless spend big on content or something.",Negative
"Honestly, I like this game a lot. The combat is fun and the story is amazing. Even building characters is not a big problem as the materials are easily accessible and beating bosses is much easier with an assisting character.",Positive
"Amazing game, has been improving with every patch and has had features that Genshin fans had bin asking for years sinc day one. The only real minus I could give it is that it's a turn based rpg, even though it doesn't bother me, there are some how are put off by this. I would rate this 5 stars, but there's always something to improve, but it's good to know the devs of Hsr actually listen to their fandom. Strong recommend even if you don't like turn based rpg's.",Positive
After stopping playing genshin impact because of trash drop rate this is great game but its too short too fast now i have nothing interesting to do slow energy regeneration so that meain you have nothing to do wich need time it has great potential and it is a great game but its too short too short to play and if you have put some money in it after sometime you going to regret it because there is nothing left to do just auto play battles. Do something about it fast.,Negative
"Cutscenes keep crashing on my phone since release patch, I thought it will get better optimize as the game goes, but apparently not. I feel really bummed out, because genshin can run smoothly on my phone but this one is not.",Negative
"The game is nice, the story quests are interesting, but the gameplay very laggy, especially when I defeat bosses, when I'm very close to defeat it, the game freezes and kick me out, this ain't the first time that it happened, Pls Hoyo fix ur game, or I will play no more üò§üò§",Negative
"I really like how they take the story and world building in this one. It's more darker than the other hoyo games. Well it is Honkai series so yeah, will not be disappointed with the story. And you know what the best part is? THEY ACTUALLY LISTEN. The dev is doing a good job making our experience playing this game amazing. And the best part is, A FREAKING FREE 5* FROM LIMITED BANNER. Genshin could never",Positive
"I've been having issues issues since the last version was rolled out. The screen goes black. En when I am about to win a battle, the game freezes and I have to close the game. I never had any issues before.",Positive
Solid story with good gameplay. Each character feels new or like a puzzle piece for another. You can do the hardest content with the worst characters letting you play with really anyone you want,Positive
"Better than genshin, the pity actually exists to where you can at least get one 5 star unit every big patch. Everything else is just standard be smart spend wisely etc. No real quit moments, and the stamina system allows you to play whenever YOU as a player want to. The only thing you will really ""need"" to farm is the weekly reset stuff if you haven't been stocking up. They did good with this one :)",Positive
"Excellent game, very good story, with voiced characters. Lots to do. I have 5 star characters but haven't felt like I need them like other games. It's a lot less complicated than other games, and way more fun.",Positive
OK so it's a great game so far has a really amazing and fabulous story as well my draw back now is why can't I change my skin color of my character to black and our mixed andchage hair style I really like the game but would love it even more if this was a feature.,Negative
i play hsr on both pc and phone and i had good experience on pc but it keeps crashing once every half an hour on phone especially when u enter battle so its unplayable on phone. pls look into this. thanks!,Negative
"I really love this game, but I've been out of playing it because the game continues to crash over and over. Most of the time it's ok, but sometimes when I open the game, when I'm entering a battle, or a new area, the game crashes out of nowhere. Please fix this",Positive
"god i love this game so much. the story is still in its early chapters but everything is fleshed out so far. i've been playing since release, and it's already better than almost any gacha game i have ever played. beautiful character designs and 3d models. the story has now made me cry twice as of version 2.0.",Positive
"This was an easy 5 star for me before this whole issue of consistent crashes on my phone. The game right now is literally unplayable on my S22 ultra, which is a shame because this was literally the one game I used to play the most. Fingers crossed for a patch that fixes this ü§û",Negative
"I don't like the stiff turn-based fights, but the graphics and ult animations are awesome. The dialogues are presumably the best part of the game; Hoyoverse has a great marketing team and an unbeatable sense of sarcastic humour.",Positive
"They listen and they deliver, absolutely good. Just one thing: instead of having 1 world a year, do like 2 worlds a year because this game has endless possibilities and story content it would be more enjoyable to have more areas to explore",Positive
"Wounderful characters, immersive storyline that gets invested in the characters. Fun and challenging game play with a great soundtrack. This game has been an amazing experience. I look forward to more content.",Positive
"Good game, i like it. But can't play on my phone, everytime it tries to do patch running it always crashed. It's been unplayable for me since 2 updates ago, and forced to play on windows version ever since.",Positive
I love almost all the aspects of the game but the biggest criticism I will give is please fix the relic system and grinding and make it less tedious. The RNG need some work and please make stats like speed and crit values easier to get because it is the biggest things that is holding a lot of accounts back including mine.,Positive
"overall impressive, but for avid turn based rpg player it's felt not complex enough and at times it felt too casual (i think its more fun if the char have a elemental weakness distinct from each other like the enemies and can be downed), other than that its remarkably good",Positive
"This game is rated for teens. This game also features lootboxes, which is essentially gambling. This game is gambling for teenagers. The game also has boring story, boring characters, no actual strategic gameplay (just gamble for the newest character, and grind for equipment), and boring areas. Only 2 interesting soundtracks, 1 quest I liked (it was a side quest), 1 dialogue conversation that I liked and was memorable, and 3 characters that were somewhat ""cool"". Please, don't play this game.",Negative
"You would like the game if you are a turn-base strategists and like nice themes , however sometimes getting the you character you want for your squad do not usually appear like other game....well the game has nice graphics and unique characters.",Negative
"Artscheme is beautiful. The developers are going well with their game. Getting better ain't hard and fun. The game has an amazing and well made story. Same thing with the characters. If you want to start playing, this is the perfect time.",Positive
"Such a good game with a amazing story, even the turn base interesting, this game is honestly better than their last title genshin and definitely worth a try they improved in many aspects like story telling animations and the way that combat feels regardless if it's turn based this is something truly unique and definitely worth your time to go and check out",Positive
"I started playing way before Penacony was released, but after the update, im getting crashes more often. In an attempt to resolve it, reinstalled the game and now crash whenever it verifies the files or downloads the game content.",Negative
"So apparently out in the infinite of space the only people with any sort of darker skin tone have white hair.... and no they aren't from the same planet Yeah for the setting being space and you being free to design whatever the hell you want, for you to go with white anime girls is a bad choice broski. Game play? It's there i guess. But its so bad the game distracts you with all sorts of mini-games and other gameplay modes. It's just bad and racist.",Negative
"One of the best games I have played in mobile so far.The character, Animation,Graphics ,Gameplay are top notch not to mention VA of all characters are incredible. The game also has a good story line. Could you reduce the pre update size?and I don't understand why it's way higher than genshin.it's a pain to download 10gb or 10gb plus every update.",Positive
"Cutscenes needs optimization. I love to watch it but its terrible, its laggy and the sounds hurt my ear since it static. Please fix this. I love the story, graphics, characters and all but cutscenes ruin it!",Negative
"Its good for now , just increase the cap for energy to 200 , it will be good..or reduce the amount of fuel use..for artifact..",Positive
I love this game so much its easy and cares about its players and is friendly to casual players and the gamers that grind a lot but I wish it had some sort of mulitplayer like a raid boss of sorts that can be 2-4 players challenging it I just feel like the game gets a little lonely not being able to play with others. Other than that I love it and the fact you can use other players characters and you get to try them out even if you don't have them whenever you need to 10/10,Positive
"Good game, the story line is good, the cut scenes are awesome but the downloading size of honkai star rail is just you know a lot",Negative
"A Good Game character designs are good,Story is good and damn the storyline in this game is far more brutal than Genshin's",Positive
"The game is good. Story wise it's going in a nice direction, the events are either long and we'll spread out or short and fun intensive which i appreciate. The characters are easy to build if you plan and allocate resources well compared to other games out there I was fully expecting to dislike the turn based combat but to my surprise it's rather satisfying as the turn based combat here has its own sleek exciting mechanics that interesting to learn as you learn more and more about the game 4/5",Positive
"Crazy how so many people think endgame content is locked to the ""new characters"". Obviously if you're F2P don't expect to get every single character (unless you're Aventurine and win every 50/50), but plan your pulls and learn to save your jades. This game is VERY F2P friendly, and is amazing for allowing you to beat content with the power of ‚ú®Ô∏èteam comps‚ú®Ô∏è. Farming is also pretty chill, since you can just leave it on Auto and watch your busted Acheron friend support destroy everything.",Positive
Great but terrible summoning on this game! Rig pulling.,Negative
"It is a top notch experience!!! Although there are some bugs here and there and maybe a few crashes, it won't stop me for giving a full five star rating on this wonderful game! BUT as an f2p it's hard to grind for jades especially because it's getting pretty limited. Overall 5 stars with great story, great characters and etc.",Positive
It's a nicely made game with stunning graphics and story however some aspects of this game is unfair. I beat the boss with my characters barely surviving but then the boss healed itself completely so all of the damage I did was pointless and my characters ended up dying and because I lost the fight I had to do the battle all over again. That's ridiculous. I can't play this anymore.,Negative
I honestly love this game I haven't found a game that keeps my this into the game in a while but the moves are great and I just love everything about the game.,Positive
"An absolute blast of a game. The story seems very interesting so far and I really love the battle system(turnbased) where the players ultimate abilities can supercede enemy attacks if you activate them quick enough meaning, if ur about to die but an ultimate gets charged you can land the final blow before they do. Character designs are fun and im excited to see how this game matures.",Positive
"Coming from 2 years of Genshin, this game is a better experience over all. Many of the things that annoyed me in Genshin are approached differently here - farming for mats and relics can be done at any time, so far every update has included enough rewards for a f2p five star, dailies are less annoying, the ui is more user-friendly, less lag, etc. I like turn-based combat, and HSR has a fun take on it, not too complex, but certainly enough room for strategy. I highly recommend this!",Positive
"The Storyline, Events and Gameplay were really great, The lore was pretty interesting too. This game is great just like the original game Hi3, there are a lot of expy's and the character design are so beautiful. Although its really hard to farm materials for character talents and builds(relics) and the rewards after battle are pretty low. But despite how hard to play it ‚Äî the game has so much currency awards which just makes the game more better",Positive
Every version is nice since new characters are good and storyline is good but bad side is the game lacks more storyline that's all,Positive
"Great music, great visuals, some of the sidequests are amazing stories. But endgame feels relatively barebones, just endless grinding with bad drop rates. Gacha itself is even worse if you are F2P. Break system feels like a more vague ripoff of Octopath Traveler's version. If you really love RPGs no matter how barebones they are, or are a diehard Hoyo fan, you'll enjoy this. If you want good gameplay, this isn't bad but doesn't stand out either. 7/10 rounded up due to google play's UI",Positive
"Have been playing it for a few weeks now and it's really fun. The turn-based battles are engaging and strategy based (especially for higher level monsters), the story is pretty interesting, and dialogue is super funny. I get a good laugh out of most of the dialogue choices and interactions.",Positive
"I really like this game although i haven't play it but i watch gameplay and i can tell that its a great game when i install it and open the app it started lagging and when it finished downloading the resources it just crash i was kick out of the game couple day past and i decided to reinstall the game and it successfully loaded to my surprise i didn't get to play long enough to get out of the cut scene cause its lagging and glitching parts of the ship is missing,Hope developers fix this:<",Positive
"Loving it! I was searching for a long time a good turn-based game, and this one really made me happy! The mechanics are good, maybe a little bit hard to understand for a new player but they get handy pretty easily. Voicelines and character design are amazing and quests are very different form eachother, granting great expirience. ‚ô°",Positive
"When I first downloaded the game it was very laggy at first and had a few problems. But beside that it worked smoothly afterwards and the graphics were nice to look at. However, I'm not interested in the story much since it's not my cup of tea. But I have to say everything is more expressive and it actually seems like the creators tried.",Positive
"The story is really good. Also, the men are just ü§å‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è Updat Feb 26 2024: I didn't update it immediately when penacony came out, but I tried to today, and my phone officially ran out of storage ü•≤ rip being able to play it. But at least I got it on my PC, and I played on it, which the story was fabulous ü§™ p.s the men still are fine ü§å looking at Gallagher ü§≠",Positive
"Graphics/Story/Final boss fight - loving it. BUT the game got an identity crisis. It's like an open world - but not really, it like and rpg - but not really, it's like a turn-based but not really. Smooth performance on my phone, no bugs. Things I really don't like: no ability to skip dialogue. Also, very very long Genshen style bounties. Definitely nothing like a typical mobile turn-based gacha. Be prepared for a 15 mins of fighting vs 2 hrs of dialogue. Drop rates are Horrible!",Negative
"This game has been a blast so far! The characters, the dialogue, and the turn based combat are exactly what I was looking for in a game, and this executes pretty nicely. The dialogue is a lot of fun and breathes life into a lot of the characters and the turn based combat is simple enough to understand but has enough there to make battles interesting. I didn't go into this game expecting to like it as much as I do, but here we are! It's a great game, thanks for making it!",Positive
It is an interesting concept. I play genshin. What keeps me going on genshin is the gameplay style and the story itself. I love the art style this game has. Everything else is just personal preference the story isnt enought to keep my attention enough to continue playing. I also dislike the turn style game play. Again ita just a personal preference. If you want a bit of a low key space train adventure epic with turn style play this game is for you.,Negative
"The reviews with 4 stars and below are from people with last century devices so it's not the game's fault why they are getting technical issues. 10/10 story 12/10 music 10/10 combat, everything. IF YOU ARE A JRPG FAN, you will love this. It's turn based!!! ‚ô•Ô∏è I did hope that there was some way we can apply multiplayer gameplays like Genshin. Random shot in the dark. I LOVE IT.",Positive
"It is a little amazing to play a game like this on mobile. Especially so smoothly! You know I've played the other Honkai games but they didn't grab me like this one has. Perhaps it's the sci-fi elements, perhaps it's the fact that it's not too open world and has some rails on it, if you'll excuse the pun. Music is amazing, good story, great fights, and satisfying puzzles. Docked a star because I don't get the clothing aesthetics and in a perfect word, this game wouldn't have gatcha mechanics.",Positive
"Best game when it want to work. Server still have its issue. It keeps kicking me out. I keep seeing this trend with mihoyo games where if your internet speed is not as fast as a cheetah on crack, then you might as well dont play it.",Positive
"only poc character is weak to the point of being unplayable, do better",Negative
"the game is awesome, honestly I can't get my eyes off the amazing designs and everything is just amazing, but I've been playing on my phone for quite a while now and I'm wishing to play on PC, but when I try to login, it restarts the whole entire game! I Googled how to solve this problem but it didn't help either. I request hoyoverse to please check this out.",Positive
"What a great game! Not too easy, not too hard, great story, great gameplay, love the characters, there's some events , lots of free stuff as well. Of course it has a gacha system but I find the store prices to be OK and you actually get the S tier characters after a decent amount of tries. Overall an A+ for me. I've played the other honkai and genchin, I did not stick on those games BUT Honkai: Star Rail got me hooked!!",Positive
The surrounding keep glitching and lagging even though my internet is good and my phone can support it.like bro i have no problem with genshin but hsr just keep glitching i hope you will fix it,Negative
"Thus game is lovely, all the way through. The characters are made nicely, and with care. Each character has their own stories and plot, all implemented in the main storyline. I especially love the small features that aren't included in other games by HoyoLab, such as the idle animation options in photo taking, auto add for character lv up materials, support characters in certain battles, and more. Lovely game, even with bugs and such. I'd give more stars if I could, and I'd recommend to anyone!",Positive
"This is actually really really good, insane production quality, flawless voice acting (English). Small optimization tweaks needed, brief fps drops semi rare on my s23 ultra at full max settings and low bloom, but Hardly worth mentioning as the hiccups are barely noticeable. Hero acquisition and interface comparable to genshin with major differences in the mechanics allowing for added strategy in maxing team build synergy and talent trees. It's a must play",Positive
"Other than the intense gacha and monetization which was expected, I loved it! No energy limitations other than those farming nodes to get relics, exp, and overall just a boost in power really quick, which makes sense, the music is amazing, the graphics ar good, would love for more decor in some places but that is just my taste.",Positive
"Great game! Love the turn based combat, it's quick and snappy on my Samsung A54, can run it at 60fps with few frame drops. Dialogue is great. Character designs are great. General gameplay is pretty easy and it's very generous with rewards. Barely started but looking to skin a lot of hours in it! The only complaint I have is the download speed and boot it, boot up is a bit slow and the downloading of assets was LONG due to slow download speed for some reason. Once that's done. It's excellent!",Positive
"Surprisingly well written and in depth turn based rpg. Looks like something I would have played on PS3. My only complaint is the movement can be tricky when doing movement puzzles. I wish this was cross playable on PS5 because it would be a lot easier with controller and the game quality is high enough that I would actually play it on console. Gacha rates are low but the pity system is really nice, and TBH I like the rates because it's very exciting when you get a rare character.",Positive
Please fix the cutsences fps drop and lag problem.,Positive
"Game runs great and basically delivers what Genshin had issues struggling with(auto and wayyy less open world collectibles shinanigans). Lots of reviews downvoting this game are people who've literally never heard of a turn based rpg game, or attempting to run the game with a potato phone and having critical bugs on high graphics due to this. Overall it delivers good stream of decent content while not being tedious with sidejobs and map hopping for collectibles and simple grinding systems",Positive
"The game is good overall, great design, music, and appal, I decided to changed the platform to which I play to pc from mobile cause i don't have enough storage and it's much better on pc than mobile. I noticed some people having issues specially on mobile after the 1.1 update, issues like error and log in erorr and some minor crashes the, the login error and crashed probably cause by device compatibility on the game or insufficient storage or most probably bugs or something. HOPE THIS INFO HELP",Positive
"Had to uninstall for a while due to storage issues, but this is a HUGE step up from Genshin in my opinion, good job!!",Positive
"Been playing from the date they launch. No rush in upgrading character, enjoying the stories and some are funny too! The graphics is super great, love all the characters and events. Overall I love the concept they're having in this game. Each characters have their own stories. For those who are busy but want to play rpg with no rush levelling, this game is perfect for you!",Positive
"Honkai: Star Rail is a very good game, fairly similar to Genshin Impact & Honkai Impact. The game itself has incredible character designs and burst animations for 5 star characters. The wishing system is suprsingly easier than the Genshin One, when i was only around Trailblaze rank 20, in total i got possibly around 80 to 90 wishes, maybe even more wishes. The artifact system may be quiet annoying, and that later on, there isnt much to do besides builidng characters. But good game overall : D",Positive
"Definitely a good experience compared to genshin honestly and I've played a bit of genshin wasn't a big fan of some things but I definitely enjoy this game a ton. Love the characters, story, mechanics and the ultimates for characters. Really well done. Haven't had a problem either so that's a plus not that it would bother me as much",Positive
"I could play this game even if it was lag but this bug have been bugging me from the start!The train from the loading screen looks like half complete and the map flickering with the floor and the wall disappearing and appearing again.When I started playing,the only problem was the login.I expected the game will get better in each update but it still feel the same.",Negative
"I love the game a lot. The only issues I'm having is when a cut scene happens the noise and the cut scene become jittery and slow motionlike. However, any other time the characters talk or anything else the sound is fine. I would give this a 5 star if that issue was fixed. I want to be able to understand what the people are saying xD",Negative
I like it but they lied about the 80 free pulls I am still waiting after all this time I will change to 5 if they give me my 80 free pulls,Negative
From what I can play it's really fun but there seem to be a bunch of missing textures which ruin the experience. I'll look in my character roster and see pink squares Edit: turns out the pink asset issue is to do with the game booting in compatible mode. If you're also having this issue try changing from whatever the default is in display settings,Positive
"Love and hate it. The combat design is atrocious and brutal towards anyone that doesn't whale on this game. The lore and dialogue often bizarre and deep cut, esoteric gibberish. The maps are deceptively linear. On the plus side, the artwork, animation, and VA is up to normal Hoyo high standard.",Negative
"It has great visuals, and you can tell that the developers put a lot of work into this game. I love the character designs, the lore, and the mechanics of the game. The only complaint I have is that occasionally the game will randomly crash and it becomes very repetitive at times. I have no clue if it's just my phone or the app In general, but other than that I absolutely love this game. It's very enjoyable, even with it crashing all the time.",Positive
"Love the art style, love the characters, great story in my opinion and the music is amazing üëè ü§©",Positive
"Great story and gameplay. Plus, it has a beautiful graphic and art too!",Positive
"The game is very good, and the rewards are pretty generous. Also, the characters are very pretty „Öá„ÖÖ„Öá",Positive
"I absolutely love the game fun mechanics, fighting, characters, and animation. But I hate when the game logs me out, logging back in is hell, every action you take/move you make, you are forced to do human verification. But in my case, when I would try to log in, it would say account or password error. I KNOW I HAVE AN ACCOUNT, with that email but it just won't work, it's not the password because I have changed it, then tried to log in afterwards with no luck and it saying the same thing again.",Negative
"Been playing quite a bit recently and have been enjoying it alot I love the story, the characters, the gameplay and features, it all blends well and the graphics are good too!",Positive
Been playing since it released. No knock on Genshin impact but I've stopped playing that gane in preference of this.,Positive
"One of my biggest qualms with this game is that the game takes up so much storage. Hoyoverse needs to learn how to mitigate that because it's terrible. Other than those unfortunate circumstances, the quests are fun and I enjoy the story. The characters are cool too. Hopefully the quests won't get annoying and tedious like Genshin.",Positive
"I didn't expect much from this game, as I'm unfamiliar with other Holoverse games, but I love it. It's got beautiful art and character design, the extensive voice acting is good, the story is interesting, and the variety of things to do besides story keeps it entertaining. I've sunk enough time in it these last few weeks that I decided to buy a bundle, but it's not pay to win. Great game! I've had no technical issues on OnePlus 7pro.",Positive
Really great game with a great story and character design. But it's held back by the rank system a bit. You level up for more difficult fights every 10 levels or so with the promise of better rewards. The difficulty sure goes up while the rewards don't feel as rewarding. I don't feel like they went up much at all if I'm honest. It is a free game so if you grind maybe in a few weeks you'll have built one character.,Positive
"I was here since pre-release, not gonna lie, was very excited for this, and this certainly lives up to the hype! The designs and story so far is great, especially when they added bronya, seele, etc. Many Very familiar faces, some all grown up compared to the HI3 versions of them. The combat is also more laid back and casual, a truly well made turn-based RPG! Drop-rates basically genshin tier though, probably the only thing I would change, also thanks for making it more f2p friendly, helps alot",Positive
I love turn based games but I wish there was an option to disable the ultimate skill animations it gets a little repetitive but other then that the game is great overall...people with low end phones get new ones cause the games are going to keep getting better n low end phones won't be able to handle newer games so that wouldn't reflect a negative rating that's a personal problem,Positive
"HONKAI STAR RAIL IN A NUTSHELL GAMEPLAYS= 2 OUT OF 5 STORY= 10 OUT OF 5 CUTSCENE 20 OUT OF 5 CONVERSATION 100 OUT OF 5 God dammit this game make me sick there's a lot super lot of cutscene, talking, conversation etc than action or battle and there is no skip button for that , jesus",Negative
"One of my favorite games. Although after a certain point when you have the characters you want, there's nothing to really do.",Positive
"Came into this game not expecting much because of how I remember HI3 was run (i liked the game but it wasn't a ""Wow!""). Funnily enough, this game had a pretty good story for the beginning and the designs of both the world and characters were amazing. Got that wow out of me. This is a perfect game to pick up and just play. You can play at your own pace, and daily quests only take 3-5 minutes if you don't want to be on too long.",Positive
"This game is so much fun! I got it about 4 days ago and I have not been able to put it down. This game has amazing graphics (even though I'm playing on the low settings), has an amazing storyline that keeps you motivated to keep playing, and very fun combat. My personal favorite part of the game is the ultimates of the characters. They're so creative and get me so hype to play even more.",Positive
"The old school JRPG experience: turn based, overworld style, with a gacha element. Honestly in love with this game, especially with the notion that 4* characters are actually worth building. However, the gacha system should have not been the same as Genshin's and instead similar to Honkai 3, but the Relic system is perfect as it's not pay to win, but it's still not a good one due to the RNG factor of relics.",Positive
"Really smooth but strategically dense turn-based combat, excellent voice work, and compelling end to the first story arc. Exceptional sound design and music. Love the rogue-like mode. Be forewarned there is gacha stuff but as a single player game that is totally beatable without spending anything it's 100% opt-in.",Positive
"I hate turn based games.. at least until i play this game. The reason i never like turn based game was because of its complexity while offering minimal feedback unlike ARPG. But this game just blow away my entire perspective on turn based RPG especially with its weakness break mechanism, it just feels like I'm playing ARPG rather than turn based game. So please try to make character's ability as simple as it can get in the future as well",Positive
"üíï LOVE! üíï Story takes place in outer space which has always been a favorite of mine. Characters are absolutely gorgeous and battles are pretty interesting, even with auto battle I find myself playing manually a lot due to better strategies making a significant difference in how the battles can play out. Sadly, it's hard to get new characters without paying: (un)luckily, the game blessed me with 4 Bronya's as an F2P player.",Positive
"Great game, easy to learn mechanics, very rewarding to f2p players, funny moments, hype moments, and was playing nonstop 8 hours until I finished the story. My only ""frustration,"" so to say is that at some point, I had access to 5 different daily tasks. I had the daily quests that aren't very rewarding (only 5k credits), the daily training, the laser game, the divination game, and the ship game, but for some reason I don't have access to the last 3 which were a good source of stellar jade.",Positive
"This game was perfect, I personally do not like the maps of Hoyoverse, idk they make me dizzy, but even though the maps can be confusing to go around, it's still 100% enjoyable, UNTIL simulated Universe. It doesn't make sense and popped outta nowhere in the storyline. Every time I attack an enemy is directed me to a different enemy. Not a taunt effect, just some random reset. I hope you guys get it fixed because I always forget to retarget the enemy I was on and it ends up losing the game for me",Positive
"i honestly inlove with this game, i like the turn based system since it feels like persona, i like the characters and the interactions (especially the trash cans and the closet), I'll be investing in this game a lot rather than genshin since im way behind on that game, honestly cannot wait for the events and updates! this has exceeded my expectations!",Positive
"I love the game. There's nothing to complain as anything that comes up, the developers end up fixing it soon. Great team hoyo!!",Positive
"The good: Game is absolutely gorgeous, runs well, story is compelling and the gameplay is fun and well thought out. The bad: too many pointless side events with no progress added to the actual story(since launch), Laughable rewards that provide very little to no benefit. No co-op or arena mode. My biggest issue is the gacha system. Even after buying monthly passes YOU WILL NEVER get the newly released characters. There is no pity meter and not enough currency given to draw them. No drop rates.",Negative
"The story is nice, and if you like genshin but not so fond of the battle style from it being a basic combat system. You'll find some fun in the turn based combat system. I'm not much of a gaming person. But the music and the story are quite cool. I really only got this game because I was passing time. But I sorta continued playing it.",Positive
"Great game,i've been playing for two months and i've pulled 252 pulls on the limited banner, and all i can say that hsr is more generous compared to other gacha games. its f2p friendly and its optional if you wanna whale lol",Positive
It's a cosmic train I can't think of many things that are both so cosy and cool at the same time,Positive
"Haven't played yet, but looks amazing Update: Since 1.0 this has been the greatest experience in what turn based rpgs respects 10/10 Update: Game's Still so freaking good",Positive
The story is like no other game could compare! And it's very generous for F2P players! Best time killer,Positive
"I wasn't a fan of Genshin Impact by the same dev but this game really grabbed my attention with space and sci-fi elements. I also love that the combat is turn based cause I have an older phone so some games are hard to keep up with. The story, characters and worlds are very interesting so far. Can't wait for more content!",Positive
"It's really fun. It's the most free to play Hoyoverse game so far. Awesome story, lore, and amazing characters.",Positive
The game story is very enjoyable. The characters and world are fun to interact with.,Positive
"A very nice game, the lore is just amazing. Suggestion : (1) Please increase the Trailblaze Power to 300. And a request, Please keep Firefly alive.",Positive
Amazing game one of the best rpgs I have ever seen But if new planet updates were more frequent then it would have been better for frequent players,Positive
"The developers at HYV clearly had fun making this game, and I'm having fun playing it. Story is surprisingly good. Voice actors are great, a lot of them even giving it their all. Art and design is beautiful. Though the combat is turn-based, they've made effort to make it a bit more than the typical mobile turn-based game. Genuine strategy can be made.",Positive
"this is the best game i ever played in my life it was so good the detail, the voice and pretty much other things good and i'll give straight 5 star! ;D",Positive
"Hsr was my first video game. After trying Genshin and feeling overwhelmed, I decided to try this (which, being turn-based, seemed easier.) I struggled but was eventually able to clear all content and had fun in the process - owed mainly to the amazing graphics, great storyline + characters and hilarious dialogue options. hsr taught me about ""building"" characters and discussing the game with my friends was very entertaining. Though I've moved on to Genshin now, Hsr is still very special to me!",Positive
"CONGRATS FOR BEST MOBILE GAME LETS GOOOOOO I've been playing since day one and I've never felt disappointed. It's so easy to get used to and auto-battle is perfect for when you don't feel like farming for materials or artifacts. The story is AMAZING and the rewards are just as amazing! Overall, so glad I invested my time into playing this game.",Positive
"Love the game, but i hate tha fact unrepeatable mission has different endings, that if you weren't satisfied you're left with bad aftertaste. This game isn't your casual visual novel which you can restart the game play the same scene and choose different outcome, would be better if we can redo the missions here if y'all really wanna go that way. I played lots of VN and the main joy and pleasure of playing them is that you can take each scene with different point of view in which HSR cannot.",Negative
"I only started to play the game yesterday but I am addicted. It is the exact type of game I enjoy. The fighting system is turn based, the world's are expansive, there is so much to collect, and the lore is so good. If any of that seemed interesting to you I would say, give it a try! I usually never write reviews of games unless I really hate it or really like it. However I will say that it takes up a very large amount of GB on your device (12-15) and unless you 100% have the room, skip out on it",Negative
Just waited for 7.5 gb update for the game to crash every single time I press start. Kind of disappointing.,Negative
The events in this game are so boring all that money and we get flash games and sadly that goes for all mihoyo games. Also PUT A FREKING SKIP BUTTON SOME EVENTS HAVE MORE TEXT THEN THE FUDGING STORY.,Negative
"look, i like everything about this game but i think making me lose 50/50 7 times on a row is crazy üò≠ it's not even about my luck, im pretty lucky in genshin. i use the same google account for both games so i don't understand üò≠üò≠üò≠ just give me aventurine's lightcone, i'm not mad i swear üôèüèª",Negative
"Honestly, terrible rng. Played since day 1, never actually won a 50/50. Never got any 5* early. Always needs 80+ pulls for a 100% off banner in 50/50s. Besides that, the game is fine.",Negative
"Cool game for a short while but: Gacha is just as bad as Genshin. Characters are super expensive to upgrade, requiring multiple days to level up and ascend just 1. There's not enough content to keep playing, once quests are done you do dailies for 15min and that's it. Optimization is very poor as game might be running just fine but later keeps crashing, phone starts overheating and so on. Relics are too random and almost never have wanted stats Eidolons are too expensive for 5* characters",Negative
"The love for this game is very real, it has such time and effort poured into it by the devs and you can tell they really care about the story they are crafting. Gorgeous art style and really well detailed Turn Based Combat that gets more nuanced with every character that comes out. Very worth the time and effort to play, and once you get into late game the game doesn't end there, with lots of really challenging content you always have something to do. Definitely more care put into this game ifyk",Positive
"I have to downgrade to 3 stars. The gear farming in this game is ridiculous. The vast majority of what you farm is unusable unless RNGesus blesses you. The resource cost to upgrade is also substantial so you have to wait for a decent piece. Unless you whale, it will take you weeks to gear a new character decently, nvm optimal. The fix is simple - make the distribution even instead of trending towards the less desirable stats and remove flat stats altogether.",Negative
The story and humor in this game are amazing and obviously the character designs are also awesome.,Positive
It's great. The story is much more immersive than in Genshin and the MCs are so relatable and lovely. Love Stelle's shenanigans :). Main story is far too short and too little atm. Farming mats are a nightmare. Tbh the second world after jarilo IV is boring and full of clutter and mazes. But jarilo IV was visually amazing.,Positive
Amazing game that really tells the story. But as a day 1 player f2p the meta changes hurts my soul. Can't clear the hardest content since it requires top characters. Seele was left in the dust not able to compete against newer Limited characters. I hope there will buffs for the characters,Positive
"Turn based combat is weird, but it makes for really fun strategies and planning and also alots for outstanding graphics and music. Exploration is super fun and the characters are all useful,so you can play the characters you like and still succeed, but there are still plenty challenging interactions and with the game still fairly new, i cant wait to se how it develops",Positive
"I love the story so much. Also, the characters are beautiful. I love this game, and at first, I did not really like the turn based Ness of this game, but now I love it! But after playing a bit, I was having an extremely hard time with the battles and would like something like a difficulty changing things like easy, normal, hard, because I can't get past the fights sometimes. But I love the game so much. Keep it up! ‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
Very great worldbuilding and storytelling. The characters are great and I enjoy the gameplay. There isn't much more story or exploration content for people who finished the main story but the game is very new so that's to be expected. I do wish it had world quests similar to genshin which can unlock whole new sections of the map but hopefully it's added in time.,Positive
"I am uncertain as to how this plays on pc, but it feels really clunky on my phone. It's more of the same, but unlike previous entries, this is a turn based RPG. This has the effect, at least for me, of slowing down an already slow game. Update 12/05/2023 Added an extra star for the story, which is currently very engaging. You do infact earn experience for battles, but you will barely notice it. This is not a game to play ""on the go"".",Positive
"even though the graphics, animation, and all of the visual designs are top notch for a mobile game, the story and the dialogue is boring. the gameplay is not for me either. you have to really use the character with the right element for attacking enemies with certain element weaknesses. it gets boring pretty fast. the gacha is not good either. many turn-based RPG games have better mechanism than this game.",Negative
"People giving less stars is just braindead, anyway, the main problem of the game is of course the company being greedy, and it's way too difficult to get in the game(around lvl 30 is way better) but enemies have lot of hp, the game lacks creative combat mechanics other than basic mechanics like all turn based games, this is way better than genshin, but as a cbt player and turn based combat player (persona 3 4 5 bc cbt and others) this lacks a little something, it doesn't do anything new",Negative
I love that this Game takes place after Honkai Impact the 3rd though I have some comments like can you add something like save Relic set like a button that if you want to change quickly without having to search for each individual sets that might be good. But overall the best and I love the new innovative gameplay direction the company took hope for the better future of this game and may all the beauty be blessed.,Positive
It's a good game but I just got bored of the game play if you like the game play it's a great game play I like genshin more butttt this game will give you alot alot alot more rewards then genshin will every give,Positive
"The graphic and sound design is super cool and I even enjoy the story. It's a really fun game, but sadly there is really nothing to do... Once you cleared though the story you are done. You can't farm anything since you don't get any rewards from repeatable content, and you can't try anything since there is no way of getting the recourses you need. It's actually funny that you can't even progress if you spend 500$ since there is literally nothing to get. Pull new characters but they stay lvl 5..",Negative
"I have been having problems in the game after the ver. 1.1 update, problems like the login error one.But I can now login now and I think you guys have now fixed the problem.But now after this ver1.1 update,most of the places in my map are not generating. And what I mean is the floors,buildings,ceilings and other objects are not showing up in the game.The only things that show up in my game are the NPCs and other objects like the destructable ones, else are void, they do not load.Please fix this!",Positive
"As much as i love the story and the characters, it really has some issues in terms of graphics. All of the cutscenes on mobile are super laggy low quality and the audio also glitches out. It is super distracting. No other game that ive played on my phone ever does that. And also, the powercreep between characters is pretty bad, compared to other games. In terms of single target its only seele thats the best one, but aoe characters are seemingly powercreept every update. Hoyo fix your game.",Negative
They better give high fps option üóø they didn't add high fps option üòï not only that the optimisation which was peak earlier is now not upto the mark,Positive
"Based on the preference in games that has story-lines, adventure, rpg, and has a not so hard to fight in battles and instead is basically a strategical gameplay in terms of; leveling up your character, setting the team up and etc. says that this game is definitely one in the books, I'm not saying this as an otaku in fact I am not, so literally when I first played this after watching a few streams I was definitely shocked by its quality and got immersed onto the game real quick. Highly recomended",Positive
"The game is amazing. The graphics, animation, and overall story are very well done. My personal issues that i would like them to correct. Be a little more generous on quest rewards. Sometimes, it feels quests are not worth the time. Make quests more challenging both in combat and complexity or allow players to select the complexity based on their progress and level of their characters",Positive
"Appreciate the detail put into characters, and the weapon banner gacha is a massive improvement from genshin's. My favorite part of HSR is the simulated universe, and I look forward to new worlds and paths. However, I wish there was at least one form of coop play, such as raids. This game feels like much of the effort Genshin put into the environment and coop play, HSR put into refining the combat system and features. In my opinion, it's a balanced trade-off. Great game so far.",Positive
"It's not a bad game, but the amount of text and not being able to skip it is beyond annoying.",Negative
"A quick casual game, has a lot of gamemode so theres always something to complete. Could be overwhelming but the events are not limited so theres no rush. Very generous and fast with rewards and qol. The difficulty is just nice as you level up, its not easy mode when you get to higher level (it might get boring if it is).",Positive
"the game is great but recently when i open the app to play the display is glitchy, the train is cut off, the ground isn't there, there's like a tv static appearing all over the screen and it's laggy even though the graphic settings are in the lowest possible. i'm also not sure if it's my device because i recently just bought it, it's a samsung ao4 4gb, 128gb ram and my internet connection is good as well. i hope something can be done about this",Negative
Game is alright. I did want a rpg and the graphics and combat mechanics are decent but it is lacking a lot of interactive gameplay outside of the main story. So far daily quests are just talking to npcs and I just had 1 which involved combat...hopefully they step up their game and offer more variety of daily missions. There are a few dungeon type modes that are for long term progression,Negative
"It is a very fun game to play, it has cool storyline, visuals, characters and the animation's are really cool especially the details, and the background story of the characters are well planned and are very detailed, I would really recommend this game if you have enough storage, patience, doesn't get bored easily...",Positive
"In my personal opinion from a turn base perspective, I think it's a wonderful game. It has multiple options in dialogue and it doesn't feel like those options doesn't matter. Some of the interaction is pretty funny. Not only that they add some direction also by letting you explore as well by giving you that freedom and not only that it does have multiple activities to do unlike most mobile games. I like the graphics as well. I wouldn't say it's the best game but certainly it is good",Positive
The game is awesome but I will rate it 2* for now since the game keeps on glitching on me. Whenever I Interact with a character it will start flickering and I have no choice but to restart the game. Even though I have restarted the game it's still flickering. My phone can withstand Genshin Impact with all the resources downloaded so I'm sure it's not on my gadget. I will change the rating once I'm not experiencing the problem anymore. Thank you,Negative
I love the game but leveling up to 25 it's so difficult I have collected every chest and finish every quest I have to wait for the next day to get something some xp from the daily quest when you finally get to level 25 the story is so good and I love how many troll option you can pick it always make me laugh please don't stop putting troll options. Update this gave you a free five star character and 20 pull. The storyline of Bailu. I love how you can beat him up in the end,Positive
"It is a awesome game, I came here because I loved Genshin and I wanted to try other games that looked like it. At the beginning the game would ban me when I tried playing... But I fixed it by restarting my phone. There was other problem, that's not bad: I wanted to play with my friend, but there is no multiplayer in this game. I was sad when I found out, but after all I noticed I really love the game, such as style, animations and characters. As expected I loved it, but really I wanted co-op.",Positive
"Good for now. The animation is really what u expected from the game company. (nice). The beggining is very friendly, it offers a lot of stuffs. However the game require a lot of time when u just started. Its a fun turn based rpg with nice storyline. Give it a try. Edited The game have same mechanics like Genshin stuff and it kinda bored me.",Positive
Fix the login error it's very annoying,Negative
"I need to retry for 5 minutes or more just to login to the game and also the data usage is so huge like for what? It's just a turn based even genshin that is open world doesn't use that much of data, and the ping is always red but when I check my network speed it's considered quite fast. I really disappointed with this game tbh. I need to play less this game so that it's not gonna use a lot of my data. Mind you that you need to use good phone even this is just a turn based, sounds ridiculous.",Negative
"Overall, this game is pretty impressive, I like the graphics, the story, and the characters, but for some reason, the game keeps crashing when I'm fighting an enemy I don't know if it's my phone or the game but overall i like it I'm going to give this a 4 star rating, I hope you can fix the whole crashing thing ;)",Positive
This game is one of the best games that i have played so far. The animation is amazing for a free game and the graphics are good even on weaker devices. At first i wasnt a fan of the turn based combat but now i really enjoy it. By far my favourite part of the game is the music in combat. The music for bosses is amazing.,Positive
3 stars because I'm experiencing a lot of Error when logging in and I know I'm not alone in this experience | Update: All good now,Positive
"Having a great time playing this. Game is very engaging and the story is very good as well as the production quality of the cutscenes. Can get a little grindy, but that's what you can expect from a Gatcha game. Add Controller support as an Xbox, PlayStation and Backbone user, and I will give 5 stars!",Positive
Mindless Fun for limited time. Very nice,Positive
"I have to say it's a great game. But my 5 stars would be if the game really gives the option to skip CGI and mandatory watch scenes. While I understand this may be a big plus for some players - for most players who play in between travels, this is taking too long... plus, if somehow we have to switch out from the game for some reason and then disconnected, you have to repeat these non skipable CGI scenes.",Negative
"I played about 30 minutes of the game, and the movement controls on the phone just felt clunky. Specifically, the camera was difficult to keep adjusted, with scanning surroundings feeling like I was wasting a good 30 seconds per room, and I'm not going to fight it every day for the next 6 years on my phone. I'll try it again when it comes to Playstation, but playing it on mobile just isn't worth it to me.",Negative
"after the version 1.1 release, many of the players kept getting this one message ""login error occured. please try again later. error code: 1001_3"" . i'm one of the players who kept getting this message whenever i try to log in but i somehow manage to join the server by restarting the game (my friends did the same as me) but now it's different, no matter how many times we restart the game, we tried many methods, we reinstalled the game multiple times yet there's no hope.",Negative
Only ever had one problem with it but the developers told me how to fix it. Good game all round.,Positive
"Nothing interesting or new. Running around chasing boring tasks and quests that feel more like a job than a game. The turn based fights are so amazingly boring. I was tired of turn based fights back in the 80s on the Nintendo playing Ultimate or Final Fantasy on the game boy in the early 90s. 40 years and you can't come up with something new? I'm a science fiction fan, and this didn't satisfy that craving at all. So yeah, I hated this game and am sick of the Anime graphics. Just stop.",Negative
This game is amazing üëè the graphics are very good and you feel the characters is talking to you this game is perfect for lonely people üëå,Positive
"Love how dailies can be quick to do, love the auto battle, hate farming (my job is tiring and I don't even feel like playing every day). I'd also appreciate it if the updates were made in-game, with a cleanup happening before download. I have taken to manually un/reinstalling it every time a new version is out, because my storage is overloaded with pictures of my late pets (from when they were still alive, don't worry lol) that I refuse to delete or let go of.",Positive
"it's pretty good, fun, and awesome game, i love the graphic, i love the detail, it's all really good",Positive
"The graphics are actually pretty good for a mobile game. But even with my ROG gaming phone, it stutters just a bit at the highest settings at 60fps, so I've had to play it a high settings. The game still does stutter sometimes and also crashes, although very rarely. As for the gameplay, it is very entertaining and fun to play, although I completed till their latest chapter release pretty quickly so players might be stuck if they're playing it daily.",Positive
When I first started the game it was casual I was playing normally and got in deeper into the story line(progress) but I quit because of my academics I recently tried to download it again and log in back to my account but the account got reset all that progress for nothing. I hate this game,Negative
"Simulated Universe is the best gameplay mode that I've seen in a while. Dear developers, if you're actually reading this, I hope you can make more Blessings, Aeons, and Curios available as the game continues to grow. That will definitely boost the replay value immensely. Even as it stands, I replay simulated universe with all kinds of builds, even if I've already completed the world.",Positive
"Awesome Game so far , wish the tickets for characters were a bit cheaper and tickets were more easier to get. Also this need to be on windows through google play that's so we can either transfer our save data or continue where we left off with out a hassle of starting all over with a new web client like Epic or Steam. Over All Wonderful game.",Positive
"I actually really liked the gameplay and the character design, but I have to say the grind for usable (not even good) relic is incredibly awful, even more so than Genshin. Add to that, there's no version main event that I actually enjoyed. All of them are tedious, they're quite frankly boring, and have nothing to do with the actual turn based gameplay mechanic. I was very excited for this game, but I found myself burn out only after 5 months of playing.",Negative
"The game is great if possible I would like to play with a lower graphic than it can go because the game freeze and crash from time to time, I believe it's because my device can't handle a lot at once. My device don't heat up and the game run smooth just fine with 30 fps but I'd like it if it can get better.",Positive
"Amazing game. I play Genshin everyday and I know around the X.6 X.7 and X.8 patches the game has a little dead zone which I can't complain because a new region is coming soon. This game has satisfy my needs with a whole new story, amazing designs, sound, music, voice acting and most important the battle. I have never like turn based games until now! I recommend this game strongly for anyone looking for something new but not feeling to distant from Genshin other than being turn based.",Positive
Beautiful game with amazing graphics if you want to really enjoy the game don't bother learning about the wish system,Positive
Been playing from the start! The story writting is incredible; its very immersive and flows very nicely. The graphics are great; the game runs smooth both on phone and on PC! The visual details of the characters are incredible and voice acting has been done so well!,Positive
Surprisingly works very well on phone. Arguably I prefer it over PC The story is good the gameplay is good and you get a lot of great characters from the start Its turn based combat system is easy to play on a phone too I barely feel any pressure to roll for new ones because the ones given are good enough to play story There is lots of rewards and things to collect daily and via game/story progression Overall its a very fun game even as free to play,Positive
"This app is online casino, that disguises as a game. It doesn't even have appropriate age rating. Children must not play it.",Negative
"I don't leave reviews for games, but this game is *Chef Kiss* to the extreme. FAIR WARNING!! It's a very expensive gacha game. Don't expect immediate high pulls; that's ok though! Each character is very unique, and you can create some amazing teams as you progress through the game. The battle system is fun and very challenging if you don't pay attention to what you're doing. It's definitely a game for the whales. If you're an anime fan, you'll love the design and story. 9/10 game.",Positive
"For a turn based game. I was not expecting much. However, this game is amazing in aspects of its turn based combat and world exploration. I can play this on high graphics without my phone acting up, and even the settings on low look great. Character design is amazing as well.",Positive
Why the game don't have skip button for storyline? I want to play the game but can't watching the storyline the whole day üòï,Negative
I downloaded a gsme on my phone which really tskes much time to download resources bt managed to download and game can be playable. But my concern is when I install it on my PC from the official website itself and it took me a day currently to try finisshing the first downloading resources which is a total disappointment itself. I waited a few hours to complete but it says to retry and get back to its 15% game resources and the factI did it many times!! It took much of my time for nothing..,Negative
"I'm really enjoying the game. The story, game play, and characters. I understand that it has a gacha system when it comes to getting certain characters, but sometimes I feel like the system is rigged. I've rolled for certain characters multiple times but to no avail. I feel that the gacha system should be dial down a bit to give players a better chance at getting their favorite characters, even if it's just a little bit.",Positive
"The Story is really amazing! I thought ill get bored with the turn based but with the unreal vision (graphic) and great rules to the games makes it awesomely enjoyable! I just completed the ending of Jarile-VI. Im completely satisfied. It feels really time worthy. The cutscene feels immersive like a huge movie! Sorry if this too formal, I also tried to use better words but Im kinda bad still with english, hehe. Just shows how satisfied I am. I also rated Honkai Impact 3rd back then in 2019",Positive
"First thing I Wana say is that it's really good. It does not take up too much space on my phone AND it runs very smoothly. As a genshin fan as well, I say that the developers made a great improvement with honkai star rail. This game is extremely interesting. The only issues I have so far is understanding the story line and the part where u pull for characters are not as exciting and exhilarating as genshin. But overall it's almost the best game I have ever played. Keep it up",Positive
"it still gives me the log in error, but i found a way to get in. The game is simple, it's a turn based game, with a fun addition of puzzles in the world. It is a lot faster to open the game, & the mechanics are simple to understand (if u have basic rpg knowledge). I love the idea of the break. The quests are easy to maneuver around since it would immediately bring u to the location in the map, all u have to do is teleport. So far I am satisfied with the game (:",Positive
"Boring, predictable, drawn out story, boring, predictable characters in a world that could have been interesting with gameplay that genuinely is fun but gets ruined as soon as auto combat becomes available (after the tutorial). Top it off with some borderline predatory monetization and you got one high quality but still mediocre gacha game.",Negative
"takes too much space, wont even let me change my damn linked gmail on my hyv acc, i accidentally linked the wrong gmail acc and all it does now is give me 'too many requests, try again later'. ive waited for days already lmao",Negative
"Feels a like a video instead of a game, graphics are super ugly, graphic is bad too, just making thrust trapping characters as a reciprocation to their poor game mechanics. Just focus on genshin cognosphere, you can't even make that good yet making new worsen games. Not to mention the turn based system sucks just declare this as a card game disguised as something else",Negative
"(edit) dropping my stars due to the insane amount of useless and HUGE updates. No reason for console sized files. This game is amazing! Great character design, graphics, OST, and gameplay! Instantly fell in love with the Turn based combat system... Have had 0 issues anywhere with anything. And I'm playing on an outdated LG V60... So to all the folks having issues with the game... Keep in mind, it's not the game having issues, it's your phone.",Negative
"The game is great, The abilities and their visuals are splendid! I love how they give lots of rewards to the player, Although I'm experiencing some laggyness on the game but overall the game is very well developt! You guys did a great job at creating the game!",Positive
"Good and challenging game, but it keeps crashing. Once or twice is fine, but when I have to go through a boss fight, and the boss has 5% health left only for the game to crash and I have to do it all over again...it's beyond frustrating and really ruins the experience.",Negative
"Absolutely love this game, from the south to the st to the lore to the characters and the voice acting. Everything related to the honkai series has been perfect. Game is very much entertaining and it feels great to see favorite characters return like Himeko. The music is best and the acting is to notch I can't find any issues. Definite recommend for everyone.",Positive
"Counter bombing the 1 star revs that genshin players left. But, anyways, I saw some reviews saying that the game is hard or the end game content is too much, but I think it's just fine and viable. The only actual thing that's hard is building the characters which takes up a LOT of time esp if you don't have much of those exp thingy. But overall, this game is honestly very f2p and very fun.",Positive
"Game keeps crashing when I try to update game on phone. Redoing my review, worst update ever, Ruan Mai an Acheron ults crashes the game and it's unplsyebale",Negative
"I would describe this gem as a hybrid between KOTOR and Cixin Liu's book The Three-Body Problem. It looks beautiful, the dialogue is elegant and even on my simple smartphone it runs relatively smooth. Diablo Immortal should take notes! That game's lag and freeze issues were insufferable. Just got started but I'll be taking my time on this one. No need for a speed run! ü§©üòéüëç",Positive
"Overall great game but absolutely horrendous on mobile, takes over 30GB of space and more with each update",Positive
"Great game, they fixed a lot of things + a lot of QOL improvement over Genshin. But I started playing because they put PS4 and PS5 on their website at launch. PS4 has been removed since launch and they are behaving like it was never ever meant to release on PS4. They didn't even address why it was on their website at first and now not. And like Genshin, no Switch version. On PC, movement buttons are forced to WASD and I don't have a QWERTY keyboard and they won't allow mapping those keys.",Negative
"It's alright. If you want to play Genshin in a flat linear world as an SRPG, this game's got what you need. Every system is painfully and obviously ripped out of Genshin and reskinned sci-fi, which is a big detractor for me. Light Cores = Weapons, Eidolons = Constellations, the same XP system to level characters and weapons exists. Menus are nearly identical to Genshin overall.",Positive
"The game is awesome and I really like it the story line is excellent and there are tons of side quests that can give you extra rewards so you won't get everything done too quick, the best part is that you have many choices of responses during conversation's so you can chose the ones you like the most like the ""it's a bomb"" line with the suit case. But in my opinion you should probably add emoji's to the friend's chat and an auto translate because some might find English difficult. Great game üëç",Positive
The game is very good and beautiful and hoyoverse is also extremely generous with the stellar jades. I love this game much more than Genshin impact but there is one big problem with the cutscenes. They always start to lag and the voice always cracks in between. This makes me sad as I can't view the beautiful visuals because of this.,Positive
"(I play on ps5) This game is absolutely GORGEOUS. I love the voice acting, the designs, the combat, the effects, the music, EVERYTHING. Genuinely I love everything and it surprises me cause games like these never really grab my attention, but I've fallen in love with Star Rail",Positive
"Why 4 ‚òÖ you may ask? CAUSE I SOMEHOW LOST MY 99 PITY WHICH MAKES ME SO DAMN ANGERED (please Hsr god... I can't farm stellar jades any more all the chest... Trotters, puzzles, nothing works... I grinded all them all including the quest, please give me for stellar jades...",Positive
"LIKES *Fast paced, turn based combat *Beautifully designed attractive playable characters *Beautiful sci-fi setting DISLIKES *Story can sometimes be boring and if you don't like the dialogue going on and on and on, you can't skip them *I can't get the characters I really want from the Warps unless I want to either spend a lot of money or grind out Stellar Jades. My team does fine but I just like certain characters and I just find it super annoying and discouraging when you lose on the Warps",Negative
"This game is great and the graphics are good despite playing it on mobile and I'm enjoying it so far, but there's an issue when you can't log in to the game because of log in error bug. Also when I'm in game, the ping is only yellow or red despite having a good internet and other game like genshin is green ping. I hope you fix this issues asap.",Positive
"honestly I love this game it's so fun and entertaining, sure you get a little bored after finishing most of the missions since it's a fairly new game, however, ever since the last update I have been unable to play at all. The game crashes a lot and everything is glitchy, like everything in the game will glitch and turn invisible and ik its not my phone bc I have plenty of storage and my wifi runs it ok so I'm not sure what to do.",Negative
"no option to skip boring story cutscene, forcing player to waste their time hearing useless dialog. However,nice gameplay tho.",Negative
"Seriously one of the best games I've played. Amazing characters, with the ability to earn the pulls and not put real money in. The story is addicting, with cinematic cutscenes that make me want a movie. And playing on mobil is just as smooth as on PC. Also turn based combat is a favorite of mine. You really get the full potential of all characters. Love it.",Positive
"I thought this game was another massive free roam world similar to genshin or gta, but thankfully especially for me, nope, it's fighting gameplay is RPG style, i really loved that, easy to understand, and gacha is very good also. I also play genshin but to farm and collect, here and there is tiring, and i have other games needed to be played (CoC, Blue Archive, Arknights, MLBB). So i have very limited time to play. Plus, HSR graphics are awesome, Love each of the characters design, Ult and Story",Positive
"This game is amazing! Great graphics and interesting lore. My main issue is that sometimes when I click something in the game (mobile), could be anything, it takes me out from the game and forces me to go through the intro again..please fix it when you have the time! Overall, I love it!",Positive
"One of the best games i've ever played. I especially love the characters and story telling. But in this last update there have been a lot of bugs, lags and rendering issues.... I honestly miss the previous patch where i didn't have to worry about where to find a new device to play it (if i ever do that is :( ).",Negative
"This game is great and fun. The characters, their expressions and many more. Bravo for that. But this game, is full of bugs. For example, everytime I go to the character menu, the screen bugs out. Same as everytime I do the calyx, the screen bugs out. This game is buggy but if you fix it, I will be sure to enjoy it more. Many thanks.",Positive
"i like this game. for the fact that it released only a few months ago, its doing okay. but the game could be so much better and i trust in the process that there will be improved features. the animations are nice, but it feels a bit too much like genshin for me to like it. i wish they stuck to the ""honkai"" in star rail. they didnt exactly do honkai character stories justice, like seele and bronya. theyre a bit boring. events are super fun, theres nice endgame content but not enough quests.",Negative
"Updating my review. This game need lots of optimization. Either crash or glitching keep happening just by opening menu. Now my game is unplayable because the screen is stuck on glitch. Also it way too bright as in animation has too many flashy things, compare to genshin even though its daylight they doesn't make your eyes hurt. The world looks empty because it's huge, but huge for nothing. And last, you can interact with bench/chair but cannot sit on it??!",Negative
"My phone is in optimal performance when it comes to games as heavy as this one, but HSR keeps on crashing after ver. 1.2 I'm not satisfied with this experience because instead of enjoying the amazing plot line and stories and game play it turns into a nightmare where it suddenly blacks out and crashes mid fight.",Positive
Good and fun to pass time with. Would be nice if the gap between content updates is shorter as there is not much to do at the moment once the main story (doesn't take that long to get through) has been completed. Or at least some sort of event that drops between each banner phase.,Positive
Tried playing Honkai Impact 3rd but wasn't for me but Star Rail is for me haha this game is beyond amazing! Kept me wanting to keep on playing 24/7! Keep it up HSR!,Positive
"Nvm I edit the review again, at first I thought the Disconnecting problem is because of my dying connection. But it seems like there is something with the way the game handle its connection that made it constantly draw too much bandwidth, that only with the slightest disturbance to connection cause it to disconnect. the problem with disconnecting is that it take you back to login screen without even attempting to reconnect first, and it could put someone off from the game. If possible, pls fix..",Positive
"I really like this game, but the updating process for each patch is essentially a multi-hour long hostage situation that forces you to sacrifice all your files for the game. I tried to download the newest update and spent over an hour just for the download to each 60% and then suddenly stop due to storage, all the while I had to keep the app open while it's overheating my phone. I really love this game and have no problems otherwise but it's absolutely ridiculous",Positive
"It's meh. Well polished good characters but rewards are sparse can't level up your whole party without significant effort. Game play is lacking there's not enough characters to fully explain any of this but it feels as if they're doing the bare minimum without appearing to do the bare minimum. And if that's how the game feels, then they did a poor job of it.",Negative
"Great game so far I really like it for a got'cha waifu game but no controller support or the ability to have cross progression between your mobile game and PC version is a shame... Please add controller support and cross progression. Edit. I figured out that you just can't use your Google on PC for some reason but I used my hotmail email and it works, still odd but I gave a star back for it.",Positive
Overall experience is too good ... But defeating Sam: Stellaron Hunter was not my cup of tea ... I tried to beat him 18 times still it was so hard ... I decided to upgrade from Level 50 to 60 character level with all the weak points of Sam ... But everytime I was unable to do it ... It was too hard for me ... Hence I decided to uninstall as it was taking 22 gb of my device and also I couldn't progress because of it ü´†,Negative
"This game is just so addicting to play, the visuals and graphics are amazing. The lore and story telling is so smooth and capturing, I can't get enough!,plus the game is so easy to understand, the fighting part of the game is super awsome to because you can put the fight on auto if you busy and speed up the fighting time, so u don't have to spend alot of time to grind for materials to acend characters you've gained. live laugh love Star Rail !!!!!! \(‚óè3‚óè)/¬∞‚òÜ‚óã",Positive
"Please fix issue, had white assistive touch on the first battle which I can't seem to bypass.. Stuck with not anything I can control and I'm only on the tutorial not on the game itself..rebooted game, same thing when the dancing character enggages to first battle with tutorial.. Seems like a bug needed to be fixed.. It's not a good impression for new users experience what I experience..please fix.. Still stuck, I can provide pictures and screen record of this.. I have it documented.. Thanks!!",Negative
"The game is fun, especially on PC, but it seems to not even let me launch the app on mobile, it just starts to overheat, for reference I am using the Poco f4 gt, when I try to download the new updates through the game, it overheats the phone to the point where I can't even use the app, it just needs this fix, when I'm out, I need to put a water bottle next to my phone to literally water-cool it.",Negative
This is a wonderful game with stunning graphics and character design. The world development and the story are also not too hard to follow and as of right now it doesn't feel overbearing to do anything. There's not really an option to play with anyone but you can use other people's characters to assist you in certain battles!,Positive
"I can't give this game a good or bad review since i like some things. On the good end: Visually the game is fantastic. I like the story, the characters, scenery, graphics, abilities. They're all pleasing. The world's are nice and diverse. The worst end: I can pull so many times for a banner character only to never pull them and only get 4* and 4* dupes. I don't want to spend money for 5*s. I deleted the game for this reason. 90 pulls is still a 50/50 for the featured character. Money hungry.",Negative
"A pretty nice game,great graphics,great stories that has some good plot. Pretty much a great game recommend Downlaod it its a f2p friendly even tho its gacha",Positive
it's good but it takes WAY TOO MUCH storage and it's very hard to get relics. WORST WISHING SYSTEM EVER,Negative
"Great story, great combat, great characters, great story, and very playable on mobile",Positive
"Really like the game so far, got to the end of basically all content so far so more content please!!! Definate difficulty spike towards higher levels, think simulated universe lv4 or 5 boss is pretty bs got past the first stage and then you can't get rid of debuffs on allies so you just get wrecked shouldn't be a 3 stage fight it's hard enough as it is",Positive
Trash game with a heavy leaning towards making female characters only good. Just stick to the genshin they tossed alheithem and neuvillett at least,Negative
"Still the best free game to play on playstore beside Genshin Impact. Everything is perfect. It's definitely an amazing game. The graphics, the animations, the storyline, the musics, everything is top notch amazing. It's Hoyoverse's game after all. Totally recommended.",Positive
"Great game, a breath of fresh air for sure, definitely deserve it's praises. The combat system and elements and class separation is unique and good too. Surprisingly have end game which is fun and kind of difficult too. Let's see how it manages in the near future.",Positive
"I've been having so much fun playing this amazing game. It's also not too much space for most devices, especially when you consider the quality and quantity of content, and the updates are great and it's nice that there's a nice break between updates so it never feels like you spend more time updating then playing. Thank you so much! Keep up the good work!",Positive
After spending 2 hours on both Star Rail and Genshin to try to find my saves on my Facebook accounts I'm in belief I lost both accounts not sure what happened but I'm just over it.,Negative
The game is really good but the problem I have with the game is that the game keeps on crashing after playing for few minutes even though I have a good gaming device(mobile) it keeps on crashing which make it unplayable I'm able to play other big game like genshin smoothly but star rail keeps on crashing I hope that this problem can be solved in future updates,Negative
"Fun, great and enjoyable. Characters are amazing, love the graphics and back stories for each character you unlock. Easy to understand and the tutorial is super easy and quick. Tons of interactions you get to decide which response you like (always liked this option) and it's not hard on the phone or your battery life. Haven't had any issues like some are stating, I'd click on information which also includes how big the game is and if it's also compatible with your phone.",Positive
I'll get to the point quickly. Over all it's a beautiful game but my experiences is every time I ejter battle it just pause with a white line and will crash afterwards. I don't know if it's a bug or just my phone but it's annoying that i can't play properly. And hope they'll fix the bug.,Positive
"I originally stared playing this game after I had to delete genshin because I did not have enough space for it, but after the penecony update I had to delete hsr aswell as I didn't have enough space. I am surprised that a game which has only been out for around a year suddenly has almost the same amount of gb taken up as genshin. Love the game but PLLSSSS decrease the amount of gb it takes up üò≠üò≠",Negative
The story is great and the gameplay is not bad as a turn based game. I do hope that future updates will feature the continuation of the characters' stories and look forward to new special events that will have unlocked new characters and light comes from new chapters of the game. I enjoyed grinding more often and the daily mission is not really bad except is a bit short and sometimes does not include battling with enemies.,Positive
"mhy should've allocated their resources on improving Genshin instead of releasing SR prematurely. QOL is definitely superior, but the gameplay is repetitive. And worst of all, the story is oddly paced. Like, we already got Danheng's story 3 patches in and abt to get March's soon. It took yrs for HI3 minor cast to have resolutions to their arcs. There's just no build up. No intrigue. Is just a lot of flashbacks and fanservice. No reason for heavy investment as GI or HI3rd unless changes are made.",Negative
"It's a traditional JRPG style. Has a gotcha system, but your starting party is fairly strong (like Dan Hung). Seems to be on the giving side for free pulls and Stella fragments (to use for pulls). Especially if you like to read, there is a lot of lore and some quality of life made the game even better. Events take days to do so there's usually something to do",Positive
"Still, in the new patch, my issues have NOT been fixed at all!! Assets fail to load, the surroundings disappear, cutscenes stagger, and characters fail to render. I've already contacted HYV about this issue, but I get told that it's my device when someone I know who has the same model as I do can run it perfectly fine. I'm not sure what to do at this point and it only gets worse for mobile players after each patch. My game worked fine at launch. Please, HYV, I'd love for this to fixed!",Negative
"I got this game thinking that it was gonna be like Genshin, but it doesn't have the classic Genshin combat style. It's turn-based combat(which in my opinion kinda sucks). They lied about the free 80 pulls, took me forever to gain the ability to wish; then it turned out that you didn't get them anyway. The characters are cute though.",Negative
"It was great and all.. The story was great and wishing more about it, plus the gameplay is great also for me as a turn base gamer.. The prob is the part where you farm on materials is like same of fgo and genshin so yeah.. I understand that plus now.. My problem is the storage is getting more bigger which i need to change my device due to it which is pain..",Positive
"An actually amazing game, free 5 star and 4 star when you get the mail system, and a guaranteed 4 star at the begining of the game. I have one complaint, newest boss is too hard. That's it, genshin could never.",Positive
"I've been playing it since it was released. Tbh not enough content. So far just leveling up 9 characters to lvl 80. Re-running battles to get materials, luckily there's auto feature. But is auto really considered playing??? Not enough resin, so you're limited on how much you can grind per day. Graphics are amazing. Story is good when there is content. Spawn rates are horrible. I got Clara instead of Loucha. Still salty. Lol. Really need 2 healers or break strat to do adv. forgotten hall.",Negative
"They try to blend Genshin's game play into turn based combat which makes the game feels ""slow n cumbersome"". Need to manually run around (though can teleport to travel fast between designated locations) for turn based game isn't enjoyable. I rather they remove the running part (some more cannot climb or jump to reach places faster) and focus on the contents and combat. Personally feel disappointed after the big hype...",Negative
"This game is amazing compared to turned based rpg games. The only issue i have however is the optimisation. When exploring or entering the battle, i've been suffering a lot of frame drops and it's unplayble. Definitely not recommend for low end device users. But if you are a high end device user, give it a try. Pls optimise well for low end device users like adding 45fps option just like in genshin :)",Negative
Was a good game to sink in hours of play going through the story. Despite that the end game is too monotonous. You can grind for months and still not have 1 character fully built. Meanwhile 5 new characters have come out during that time. Credits are too hard to come by. Exp is a joke. Energy regen is too slow even for a time based game. The rng on relics feels like it's not even worth it to grind for. I've sunk in energy for 2 weeks worth of time and didn't even get 1 piece for good gear.,Negative
"Loving it so far, it's the sort of game I've wanted for awhile, it's basically genshin but much better as I find henshin's combat element combos to be hard to learn and remember while star rail is more simple. I'm a turn based lover myself so combine that with an anime style, chefs kiss. I would politely ask to potentially make the game multiplayer like genshin please. Me and my partner would love to play together if given the chance.",Positive
"There's a lot to cover in this amazing new game of Hoyo. But if you like the idea of travelling in outer space and being able to actually go into different planets and spaceship, you will definitely enjoy this! The map of course is limited but it was constructed in a way that your sense of dimension is widened. The BGM is top-notch as expected. And of course the lore! I am really interested to know more about the Aeons and Stellarons. The characterization also of the casts are wonderful.",Positive
"Love, love, love this game. But by the recent update boulder town has been blinking in and out of existence. Even the user character has been lagging in and out. I started playing a few days ago or maybe a week, but now the random boxes and ores have been reappearing. I recorded it if you need to see what's wrong. It's about ten minutes but the last three minutes will show what's happening.",Positive
I love the quality and the styles are so cute and ‚ÑÇùïÜùïÜùïÉ and tbh I would love to try y'alls testing server! I mean.. I honestly play hsr daily lol,Positive
"I've never loved a game this much before. As someone who's really interested in astrology related stuff, the overall theme of the game really intrigued me. Like what do you mean we get to travel from planets to planets. It's like any other gacha game but I'm a bit biased towards it only due to space-y stuff üêß",Positive
Great game! Turn based combat Is great and deeper than you would think at first. 10/10,Positive
"Really liking it so far. At first, I thought the turn based combat mechanics seemed weird. However, being a mobile game and not using a controller, I've come to prefer it over real time action combat. Eager to progress through the game. Looks very polished.",Positive
"so far i really love this game, i've played since 26 april when the game just released. sadly after 1.1 update, i cannot login anymore, the update is too heavy on my phone. even i cannot see everything in this game, only the enemies and characters :( and sometimes the train is gone in loading screen. i just want to play again :(",Negative
"I gotta admit it's a great game but sometimes, there's just so many things going on at once from main story and side quests to leveling up your characters and focusing on their capabilities. It's gets hard to do all those things, like when a side quest takes a long time to do and you have more you need to finish especially when you have limited time on your hands. But if you have a lot of time in your hands, don't worry! On the positive side, you would be able to explore many things in the game!",Positive
"Despite my previous cringe when I first started this game. Turn base usually gives me ptsd. lol. To me this is arguably hoyoverse's best. Because it lacks my 2 biggest complaints with either impacts. Genshin or honkai. No time limits. Yaaaay!!!!! And, because it is turn based. No need need for controller support for android. Cheap. But effective. I'm gonna warn ya now. If the next character released has a quest that has ANYTHING to do with giant exploding beatles you will lose a star.",Positive
"Dont get me wrong, I like this game so much because it is from hoyoverse and I love the character designs but I can't fully enjoy the experience because of lagging, the glitching of most of the places, the missing floor and houses. I often rely on the map to not be stumble in the objects that I cannot see because of these issues. Also the cutscenes is the hardest part because it is very laggy with the sudden fps drop and I started to hate the cutscenes because this always happens to me.",Negative
"This a is a good game but there's a catch. If you're new to turn-based games I think that this game is suitable for a new player. At the start it's pretty easy but like traditional RPG games and such more, it get's harder the more you progress. One catch is if you're tempted to spend money on games you may want to keep way from this game. But unlike their previous game an open base RPG game Genshin impact. It's actually a lot more free-to-play than just money. So in my opinion try it!",Positive
I LOVE this game am. Very fun and I love all the characters. All the characters look so cool.,Positive
"Really like this game. A good time sink for a trip or on a flight. Borderline grindy. My only complaint is that there isn't a consistent way to save up for both types of rail tickets. Banners do last a few weeks, though. That's a plus. Love the strategy and turn based style. Art and voice work is great. Highly recommend!",Positive
"Compared to the other Hoyo games, it's turn-based and more generous in terms of gacha/pulling characters. Upgrading materials for relics (artifacts) for the characters are a bit tricky but you'll get used to it soon. The characters are amazing and I love that the storyline is also silly and goofy from time to time. I hope that the game keeps improving for the better overtime!",Positive
"Loved the style of the game and its gameplay, though the story can somewhat be bland but still kind of interesting(?). Though, the difficulty of the each fights are off and unbalanced. Despite the game saying the required level is (#), it actually meant to be 5 levels higher(or sometimes even more!). Though take this review with a grain of salt as I've had troubles with actually leveling up my character because of being stuck in the FIRST equilibrium challenge. Quite easy if you have the cash.",Negative
Login screen is buggy as hell as every time i try to verify my email it just resets and wants to send code AGAIN,Negative
"The game is great overall. Graphics is smooth. English voice acting, character design and stories, limited events, and gamplay are all great. The only downfall is that it's always showing error whenever I open the app. So overall no matter how good it is, if it can't be played, then I won't be able to appreciate its greatness. Overall 2/5. Edit: Issue was already resolved. Changed review from 2/5 to 5/5.",Positive
It's truly a great gacha game. You don't have to spend but the quality of the game you don't mind to. Fair rewards and good end-game content.,Positive
"I really liked the genshin style but the gameplay itself is too simple, not complicated combat mechanics just pressing attack some abilty some comboes and i got tired of it pretty fast, but in honkai on otherhalf i really liked all the strategy that you can deploy with your team, maybe not in early but in late, depending on situation, you can really change the team comp to get synergies, strategies and pattern depending on your enemy and is really fun",Positive
"Really love the game. Absolutely wonderful story that I've seen so far. Only problem is that Cocolia's Echo is a bit too difficult. I probably need to level up a lot more. Still, a difficulty option would be nice. Edit: Nevermind one of my party members was grossly underleveled, so the fight isn't too hard I'm just too dumb lmao.",Positive
"Trades in the action fight style of Genshin for a turn-based system, which is still rather well designed. Otherwise follows its sibling game quite closely in character development. For a mobile game, it comes off as very polished and well put together. Was pleasantly surprised to find it runs smoothly on my budget phone, which I'm sure wouldn't be the case for its sibling game.",Positive
"Similar to Genshin Impact, this game is very high quality. Visuals, music & surprisingly gameplay & story are amazing! The first world was surprisingly very fun to play in & the story exceeded my expectations. I really liked the extra interactive & funny stuff sprinkled in, it adds so much depth and rewards you for exploring every corner. I did not expect myself to also like the turn based gameplay but it feels very fun & relaxing to play. U can even test characters w/'support' function!",Positive
"Really great game, but there's overheating problems on a lot of devices from what I've been told. My Samsung A71 is doing fine but heats a fair bit, but I assume there are way worse scenarios where the game might be unplayable if your device isn't powerful enough. Optimisation likely will come with time tho :)",Positive
"The UI, storytelling, most of the gameplay systems, etc. is very Genshin Impact. It has a lot of nods to its previous games and to internet memes. Genshin's daily resin grind required maybe 20min because you have to travel and turn in the commission at the guild. HSK has an auto-run mechanic so you can step away and claiming the dailies is through the UI. I like the real time combat of Genshin but I think HSR's turn based system is much more maintainable for someone with little time.",Positive
"I do like this game, however im having issues with specific parts. 1. Charecter events, they used to be based off the character but now its just talking to them. 2. When you reach a specific level, it just is difficult to do anything. 3. It gets hard at level 65+ because bosses are level 90 and we cant go over 80.",Positive
"Am I the only one who's having a hard time logging in? I mean, I tried to log in but it's like I registered again. The story keeps repeating, this happened for the second time. I couldn't play that much, so when I came back after a long time I was shocked to see that my account wasn't logged in though I didn't logged it out. And the story starts from the beginning again. My characters and their level and all, back to zero. Even so, the game itself is really great.",Positive
"Honestly one of the best gatcha games I've ever played. It's incredibly f2p friendly and you don't miss out that much when you're not putting in any money. The gameplay is fun, refreshing and has a lot of replayability. Especially with all the frequent events they're making, there's always something to do. Also the OST and visuals are simply just gorgeous, even when playing the game on your phone. Can't recommend HSR enough!",Positive
"this RPG is very well done, artistically. there is a feel to it implying there should be more to exploring, apart from the inspection anecdotes. honestly, the game feels half done, even though the story is there. it is very empty, with little to interact with while exploring, combat-wise. will update review if future changes expand on whats present.",Negative
When I tried to started the game resources download on the game keep saying that resourcesdownload failed for no reason why,Negative
"this is the most boring game I have ever played, bar none. in less than 48 hours of playing since its global launch, i uninstalled it and played something more refreshing and interesting. as good as the graphics, story, visuals, music and characters are, the turn based gameplay was so boring, time consuming and it was worse than playing the boring TCG card game in genshin which the devs also own. i will never ever consider playing this game again.",Negative
Great story with a linear narrative style. Art direction is good too because every character has their own unique look. Gameplay is light and easy to understand. Game can be played even by busy adults (like me). Gacha system could be more forgiving but doesn't hinder the experience since the game is generous with gems and resources. Overall great game.,Positive
I really like the graphics and the characters details the story is good I like how they put so much details in the characters,Positive
"This gacha game is very awesome!! I love the storyline, character designs and more! But even though I'd love to rate this a 5..The only problem is when I delete the app because of my full storage, and log in back to my account, all of my progress is gone:(( pls fix this",Positive
"This game has so much potential as a mobile turn-based RPG game. The character designs are nice, game is well optimised, and I enjoy the interactive story which really immerses myself into the game. Star rail addresses all the inconveniences i had with genshin, but it seems that the game lacks content such as exploration and side missions. I hope that the developers will add more content to the game equivalent to that of genshin",Positive
"LOVE IT!!! If you're a fan of Genshin Impact, this game is even better! The only odd part about it is that no matter what character you are, you can't jump. Other than that, I could not have asked for anything more. The storyline is fascinating and the voice actors are amazing! The graphics are beautiful, but I'd expect nothing less from Hoyoverse. It has a unique combat experience, and it's always my go-to game on boring days.",Positive
"People who dislike this game, is such an i****t. This game is really beautiful, finally the open world rpg with some turn base tactics.... Controls are fantastic, music, character. Everything was perfect. Kinda f2p, because many characters have a great potential if we can build it. Love it! Keep it up! Add more events to get more ticket for gacha please :)",Positive
"After fully completing the story (for now; there's still more to come), I can honestly say this game is 100% worth the download. The story is engaging, the characters are likeable, and the turn-based battle system feels just right. And the MUSIC! Good Lord, they did NOT need to go all out like that, but they still did it anyway! I wasn't much of a gacha gamer before Star Rail, but it's really changed my perspective on these games as a whole. Five stars.",Positive
"If I could give an award for ""best mobile story game"" the winner would be HSR. The best mihoyo game fr. But takes too much storage.",Positive
"Early game is super slow, and I think it's the spot where people are most likely to quit. The farther you go the more interesting the combat seems to feel, and the more challenge enemies can present. Some opponents are kinda BS, and I have noticed that your initial luck on character pulls can significantly change how far you can go in Simulated World or the Abyss (unlike Genshin). If you played Genshin then this game is pretty easy to figure out. Give it a try.",Positive
"I kept getting an error code 1001_3 and I did everything I could to login the game. I've restarted my wifi, my phone, turned off private dns, logged out and logged back in, cleared the cache, un-installed and reinstalled the game to no avail and it still would not let me in. I'm in Asia server and at TB level 22 and idk what's up üò≠ for something I want to sit back and relax to, I'm actually getting stressed trying to get the game working again.",Negative
"Re-editing my edited review for the 5th time. Impress by the updates made by the devs. My phone doesn't turn into a hot toaster anymore whenever I play it and it doesn't have that absurd lag it used to have. The only complain I have left are the log in issuea, still takes me 5-6 tries and we still don't have, no gear preser and no initial skip option. The game gives you wonderul free units, gameplay's fun, music was fantastic. 2",Positive
Its crazy how many people are giving this game 1 star because of their personal problems or just because they got quite literally a skill issue going on. I've been able to get to Level 28 so far and I could easily take on challenges with the starter characters or normal 4 star ones. The game is like a mix of Honkai and Genshin. Turn based combat with exploration aspects. Tho it definitely is way more rewarding than Genshin.,Positive
"I'm really enjoying the game so far. The characters, scenery, ambiance, music, gameplay and everything! I love how there are a lot of trolling on this game lol. But i do sometimes encounter lags especially on cutscenes, i do hope they fix it so my experience with the game won't be bothered.",Positive
"Hi hoyoverse... After the update the game become unplayable on my mobile device... It constantly crashes after the first loading screen (the one with Pompom and info text loading screen). Previous version of game runs without any problem. Now, a lot of textures are missing. In the log in interface, parts of the train are missing/transparent. Whenever I am able to login, the walls and other elements in the environment are missing as well. I hope you are able to fix the issue as soon as possible.",Negative
"The game is overall fun (even if it's a bit boring if you play time to time) But the bugs are getting annoying. It's rather the screen just moves all over the place or its black screen after a battle. Pretty sure it's not a problem on my device, cause hsr seems to be working smoothly in general.",Negative
"I like the game, but i think what's the problem here is mostly attack and health, like when fighting, u don't do a lot of damage, and your health just go down a lot. plus even high level. It doesn't matter, plus I'm only level 40 like it's already hard for me. For me, yall should make them weaker, even fighting other characters.",Positive
"Love the story, mechanisms,musics and especially the characters. There has not yet been a single character I haven't wanted to pull for. Outstanding designs and interesting events as well as minigames. Even the dialogues of the MC's are very interactive and makes you feel like you are actually in the game!",Positive
Best gacha so far. Generous f2p currency. Engaging story with polished visuals. Great strategy turn-based combat.,Positive
"Great game, though a gatcha game can't get a higher rating than 4, if you want me to buy a game a gladly do it and pay for your hard work but paying for a casino experience without a chance to actually make any money back does not make sense. Great story and gameplay just a tad short and when you're done with the main story you only need to log on for about 5 min a day which kind of sucks when the game itself is actually fun.",Positive
Fun and as casual as you like. You can grind it or take your time and you are good either way.,Positive
"This game, it cured my mental problems. I'm not kidding. If you haven't played it, or are skeptical about it, I assure you it is THE ABSOLUTE BEST EXPERIENCE.",Positive
"Certified banger. Having played other Hoyo games, this one is by far my favorite. Amazing visuals, great story, cool and interesting characters, and fire soundtracks. I also feel that, unlike other Hoyo/similar games I have played, the players opinion actually makes a difference. With the upcoming 2.0, I've never been more excited, Penacony looks stunning and already has some of my favorite characters design-wise. February can not come sooner.",Positive
"The game sucks at balancing dps characters, don't bother pulling them when they get outright powercrept within like one patch.",Negative
Is an really good game but there some glitch like that make your screen black and go out of the game and for the next update is an really many gbs for my phone so it force me to quit and many of my friends too this made me sad.,Positive
It's good but there's one major draw back on the app on the phone... I can not use my wireless controller to control my character it reads it like a touch pad. If we can implement a controller feature that would be super amazing.,Negative
"At first I thought star rail was just basic game, but after seeing one or two cut scenes I knew it was going to be fire. I was about to give it a 4 star because of the no jumping but ended up giving a 5 star because it deserves. But anyways, can we talk about how hot the characters are?",Positive
"Hi, this game is great and the first 'anime' game I've ever been so into. I play in both PC and mobile version with the PC version being fantastic. The only issue im having is the constant crash in my mobile device mostly when I interact with anything. I'm using android phone and will be gladly to share any info of my device if necessary. Please fix this so i can enjoy the leisure of these waifus at my bed (no pun intended). Thankyou.",Negative
"It's a wonderfully done game. The characters are memorable, the environments are great to look at, and the gameplay is top notch. But since launch I either haven't been able to hear anything or it's insanely muffled. No matter what I do, I can't enjoy the voice acting or the soundtrack so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars. I've talked to customer service about it and they said they will figure it out, but who knows when that will be. So till it's fixed, I gotta keep it at 3 stars. üòï",Negative
I'm typing this from a phone. I have installed Honkai Starrail on my windows 10. But when I downloaded it and launched the game it froze. I couldn't click anything it was only the train that was moving. Please fix this issue. I really want to play Star rail on my computer but this problem won't let me. I've searched videos to fix this problem but it doesn't work.?,Negative
"Really loved the game but since the new update it just won't load or it keeps crashing, I've tried if it was a storage issue but it wasn't. I'm now just upset I won't be able to play a game I really enjoyed.",Negative
"Installed it yesterday and was loving it, until today when I got on and it restarted the whole thing and lost all my progress",Negative
"Honestly, this has become my favourite turn based game, better than Persona 5. The fast paced strategic gameplay is great. The writing , characters and dialogues are incredible, better than Genshin. And the soundtrack is heavenly. Really good game, FTP players like me won't have much of a problem, especially if your main goal is to do the quests and enjoy the story like me",Positive
It's ok but me not being able to customize my character even a bit like skin makes it have 0 way of me getting into this game no way to choose your weapon makes it boring. Fight mechanics are subpar at best and painstakingly boring to me. It is so easy it is almost brain dead. No skipping the boring dialog. Do not care about the dull story just want the combat but that was very lackluster. I'll keep on giving it a go but so far extremely disappointed.,Negative
I keep seeing some lag after reinstalling game it wasnt so laggy before i unstalled it please fix it Edit: im now crashing each login once im loaded in map pls fix it i dont wanna miss firefly banner soon,Negative
"My Device isn't Compatible with graphics system. It's Mediatek P95 and I can see through the walls, example if I move the wall will jitters the graphics. It's make the wall visible and invisible. Please make this fix wondering it's beautiful.",Positive
"Presentation and animations are outstanding, but for a turn base RPG I find it lacking only having 1 skill per character, the combat feels barebones, I know all your games have 1 skill and ultimate but for a RPG you need more than that and the whole UI and systems being literally Genshin is a let down. Hoping for more skills per character, 2 or 3 would be ideal, so far the combat is the most disappointed part.",Negative
"Can I start by saying I have no idea about the honkai universe and I have never played any of the previous honkai games. I downloaded this because it reminded me of old school final fantasy, that it is. There is a lot going on in this game in terms of grinding for progression both with characters and your trailblazer level but oh my days what a game. The graphics are childish yet charming, the battles are overwhelming yet strategic. The story is gripping and silly at times Download it!!!",Positive
"The gacha rate is horrible. Relic stats RNG is too horrible. Good world, story and characters though. Good production value.",Positive
"I've had an amazing time playing after launch but unfortunately there have been many instances where the game shuts off unexpectedly in between a fight. sometimes it won't even load at all after the login screen. whatever the issue is, I know that it isn't my internet provider.",Positive
"By the first time of playing this game, everything was going smooth no fps lag, no lag, no glitches and the game was very nice. But since the silverwolf update the train from the main loading screen is gone, somr textures are gone, and the fps is very low even when i have good internet and enough storage for the game. Would've gave a 5 star but the update made me cant play it anymore",Negative
"Can't log in after the update. The train is only half and always says log in error. I have done different ways and methods. I got super good internet connection. Reinstalled the game and downloaded it almost 5 times. Still, nothing changes. Then I found out I have similar problems with other players. Please fix this, this sucks. Also what in-game feed back r u talking about, we can't even log in.",Negative
This is a great game! It has similar graphics and character shapes as genshin impact and there's lots of combat. Although I would recommend that they add more attacks to the characters because 2 and 1 ultimate just doesn't seem enough. I still rate it a 5 star!,Positive
Once you hit a certain point in your account progression it almost feels like you've hit a wall. The cost of leveling your characters goes through the roof however the drops per run doesn't feel like it's any better. Increase the drop rates when grinding for relics and character materials so that it doesn't feel like such a mission building up 1 character. Nothing is more unmotivating then grinding relics for hours to maybe get 1 good relic then it turning into a bad one.,Negative
"It's a nice game. When I have time I'll log on and see what I can get done. Prices are a little on the outrageous side when you factor the percentage for a 5* light cone or character. Like I work part time at Dillons... Most of my money goes toward utilities, property tax and food, there's pretty much no inbetween for me. So we all want to maximize 5 star characters, but it'd be a miracle if I did that to even 1 character... Which is depressing because the game is beautiful artistically :)",Positive
"Great mobile gaming experience. The user interface and game management (gacha, daily routine, gameplay loop) is a lot like genshin impact, but the combat is a distinct turn-based system that is deceptively complex. Very easy to play on the go or for a few hours.",Positive
"It's one of the few best Turn-Based games I've played on this store. The character designs are phenomenal and so are their precious voice actors who put their best effort to make the character a reality. This game if not has the best visuals and has great exploration, puzzles and other mechanics which contribute to the gameplay of this amazing game.",Positive
"To be honest. I love the game the overall graphics, stories and characters. What really makes this game more annoying is the way you meed to farm for materials for to ascend your characters. When you farm for materials and spent all energy but you only get so little from farming which is not good because you need to catch up fast with the events so you need to have characters with complete builds. I really hope in the future that farming for materials is more rewarding than today",Negative
I can't download this properly even my internet connection is fast seems takes to long to re download everything. I tried other games with big memory like genshin to re download all got no problem and fast too while this one is a pain I can't re download it takes to long because it got errors is there something wrong with this game or something?,Negative
"The story done so well you kinda want to jump on this Express not because of the gameplay, but because of the story. Serious but fun at the same time, full of memes and references, with relaxing turn-based gameplay. It really suitable for an office worker that rarely play games like me. Also, from someone that's coming from Genshin Impact, this is incomparable. This has different genre so all of you better stop comparing turn-based strategy with action adventure game like some amateur you are.",Positive
"Played for ~3 days, then it got stuck on initial animation and hasn't worked since. Cleaning cache/data or even reinstalling didn't work. I guess that's a sign to drop it.",Negative
A very phenomenal game that offers great story and graphics. The gameplay was a bit fun and more great options at endgame are more broader. But the difficulty of the game is what makes this game less appealing for me,Negative
Given up on playing this game and move on to fine a better game.But the story is good ngl. Unfun to play the game where not getting the character for specific game mode or mechanic.Can clear but not fully getting all the reward. Always feel left behind and under performance for every event. Guess only streamers and huge spenders can perfectly clear to grab all the rewards. Still grinding for relic sets for stats but to no avail. 80summon win once then lose 3 everytime. Playing fgo till this day.,Negative
"Absolutely horrible, I deleted the game for a while to play genshin or wuwa, and when I installed it again, I couldn't get into my account which I had DR RATIO in the free character and all my others which were good since I builded most of my stuff, BUT NOW I CANT GET BACK INTO IT? 1 star, horrible.",Negative
This is one of the most Stellar mobile games I have ever played! From the graphics to the storyline to the gameplay. The progression seems important but very natural. The voice acting is phenomenal. This feels like a console level game. From what I can tell every game is developers have come out with has been a plus!,Positive
"An asolutely wonderful game. Its definitely user friendly and is really well designed. I absolutely love the lore and the various ingame mechanics. The all-round performance of this game is flawless. Stunning character designs, beautiful landscapes, visually its gorgeous. Kudos to the development team for creating such a masterpiece. And last but not the least, even after having ingame purchase options its an extremely generous game. I am having a wonderful experience overall.",Positive
"With the recent nerfs on Jiaoqiu, I have been feeling more disappointed with this game. He has gone from what was likely going to be an extremely powerful DPS to having no use outside of a team with Acheron.",Negative
"So far so good, no bugs and crashes. My device can run it on medium graphics and stable 60fps which is the default settings. But I turned some settings to very low because I get uncomfortable when my device gets hot. But other than that everything is perfect, I love the game better than genshin.",Positive
"I have been waiting for this game for so long, and I can say without a doubt in my mind that this game exceeds all my expectations and more. There are no glaring problems at the moment, but in the future, I would love to see more unique character designs as this game takes place in space ish I would love to see some playable alien like characters based off of the aoens or even the legion.",Positive
"The game is very good and also fun, but I guess there's some mistaken with the latest in game updates, cuz when I play it the game crashed and lag... It's not the same like when I play it for the first time, the game used to be smooth when I played it but after the update the game crashed, I really hope it can be fixed cuz I like the game so much",Positive
"Im a big fan of turn based combat games, and i love the visuals to this game. The story is good, too. However, i feel like this game doesnt give a good balance between story and event content. Too much focus is put into uninteresting event stories, but at least it gives more character development for characters you can roll for.",Positive
"This game is incredible. Hoyoverse has a reputation of releasing addicting, immersive, and visually accommodating games. I'm new to turn-based games, and this game is a great way to expose yourself to new playstyles. It's very optimized and can run on most devices with the right amount of space. I personally enjoy how there are Honkai and Genshin combined aspects, and people from both games can enjoy the familiarity! I have no complaints! :D",Positive
"Incredible experience and the fact that it obviously has no ads is amazing, plus the fact that VA defo makes it good and everything is balanced, something is op but it has a certain con to it, overall there is buggy gameplay I found when you click on things like the warp area or characters, some times it doesn't load and your just stuck there unable to do anything",Positive
"The music like""wildfire""is too low, please make it loud enough to hear at parlor car.",Negative
The first time i played this game is kinda fun and the QoL features and multiple engames and really good too sometimes i wish genshin is also get this kind of treatment.,Positive
"This game has nostalgia feeling surrounding it. every time I open the game and start to play, I feel like I am booting up my PS1 to play breath of fire IV or FF9. The turn base combat here feels different from all of the other games that has gacha system thanks to the exploration mechanics. The voice acting and presentation of the characters are üëå. I hope the story is as strong and immersing like honkai impact 3. Thank you for a great game guys keep up the good work. üëçüëè",Positive
"Best Mihoyo game. Played almost everyday, and haven't encountered any glithces. I LOVE the animations, as well as the combat mechanics. BUT, the storyline sometimes gets so boring. I feel like some missions are just there to piss me off. There's so many missions with just useless dialogues and no combat whatsoever. So, if you love your stereotypical visual novel with some combat, this game's for you. But if you're looking for pure combat, then you'll quickly get really bored with this game.",Positive
"It's quite future-like, and the quests, especially the trailblazer quests are so FUN! And don't even get me started on the designs of the characters?? Had to stop myself from wishing for characters multiple times cause I'm f2p. A really awesome game with AMAZING designs and gameplay!",Positive
"Most people say the quests are not all that and the story is too flat, but I think this game is well made and well animated, everything in this game is just..chef kiss. Including the unserious conversations and NPCs, as well with numerous events and gifts with many stellar jades. ü•πü´∂",Positive
"People rating 1 star bc they don't know that this is a turn based game, lmao. These people are getting dumber. Anw, I also dont like turnbased games at first but Mihoyo made this genre interesting. This is the first time I enjoyed turn based game! The story telling is great (I think the story telling is better than genshin), the graphics looks great. My only problem is sometimes I can't enter the game bc of the error 1001 and 602, I don't have bad internet connection. Hopefully they fix it soon!",Positive
i know you want to give challenge with the new weekly boss but too much isn't even fun anymore then force us to use the trailblazer in harmony,Negative
Love this game. Story is great. Music is beautiful. Graphic is beautiful.,Positive
"This is a great game and lot of effort goes into making games like this and for people to sit back then complain giving the game one star because they gotta pay for something is just ridiculous. Also this game is very demanding on your phone, so if you don't have a very good phone then your going to have problems . This game is way cool and has a very good storyline with lots of characters , then you can upgrade each one as well , it's graphically impressive and has big areas you run around in",Positive
The updates are innovating the game every time. I like it,Positive
"I would say not to listen to genshin players, the fact that the game itself offers so much when being a starting player helps a lot with characters and builds is honestly really handy, cutscenes and story is extremely interesting! Characters and their designs being amazing! The best game ever and I'm glad it is the way it is, I'm so excited for penacony and thank you for making a great game! <3",Positive
"I love this game so much üò≠ The character feel so real and the story is very good. The graphics are AMAZING as expected from hoyoverse the same company that made Genshin Impact, Although if you use a low end device it will lag and heat up very quickly. Gameplay is turned based but its still very fun depending on the character. Its also F2p (Free to play) friendly! The only problem i found so far is the fuel/energy system ü•≤",Positive
"I love it. The characters n' all are amazing, but I've been really turned off this morning. This morning, I was tryna clear out my daily training thing and when I cleared a Calyx, my game just didn't load in anymore. Just a black screen. I closed the game and rebooted it, still a black screen. Am I just impatient or is my game broken?",Positive
"If I say that it's the best game of Hoyoverse, I surely didn't lie. Thought there are differences in gameplay; music, graphics, storyline of characters, the characters themselves, and of course above all, REWARDS we get are all Amazing. Please just stay this way about the last option I said... And thank you.",Positive
"I love the game a lot! But I have issues with logging in. It shows me ""login error code 1001_3"" when I try to and I have to re-login like 3 times before I log into the actual game. After I downloaded the 1.1 update it got worse and I get the error code no matter how many times I re-login.",Positive
"Free to Play friendly game with a lot of fun,Interesting and enjoyable contents with a magnificent or should I say peak story",Positive
Da best le graphic ‚ú® magnificent anyways i love the cute case definitely deserves the five stars like the five star char,Positive
"I really love this game, like it is actually so good but can I recommend a switch button for walk/run and a jump button similar to genshin? I know the jump button is not really necessary but it does help with that itching feeling of wanting to jump when you run, and also make change the run to dash or possibly a jumping back button to avoid enemies?",Positive
"If you've got time to burn, go ahead and play this game. Great story, art, lore, graphics. This I would recommend for casual players. On the other hand I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS for those looking for challenge and stragetic turn based rpg games. Here's why: heavy heavy story with endless dialogues, turn based rpg in which u only have 3 options in battle : Normal attack, skill, and burst. Progression heavily timegated and same with events. Welp, thats it ig, don't wanna start a rally.",Negative
Feels like your basic gacha game idea with a bigger budget. That's not a bad thing except pull rates are terrible. The only interesting character I've gotten so far(level 29) has been from the 50 pull 5 star guarantee. It's off-putting to say the least. Not to mention the random fights where an enemy will just regenerate their whole hp bar..feels designed to get players to lose now and then instead of being prepared as if the fight isn't about to end.,Negative
"One of the best gacha game I've ever played after genshin impact and a lil bit of honkai. Controls are beginner friendly, the ""in-game phone"" will slowly unlock more features the more you level up, making it easy to introduce and understand each feature on your progress. Story is 10/10 for me, it's really good, other than fighting scenes, the cutscenes are well made too. Though, I find it quite hard to grind resources and materials for the characters and other items in-game.",Positive
"Cut and dry Hoyoverse game, looks great, sounds great, if you like turn based games it feels great. However, runs into the same problems as the Hoyoverse titles, very laggy even on the lowest settings, frequent crashes, unstable connection, and you can't easily speed through the story of you are not interested in it, I personally am, but I can still feel how slow it feels. Otherwise very good game, bosses are fun as well as strategizing.",Negative
"This is a really enjoyable game,it is free to play,has a good story,soundtrack and visual effects.Edit:I set my display settings to normal and it actually fixed the issue so that is really good news,now i am able to play the game smoothly even more.Progressed even more in the game,had my most fun in a game in a long time.when events start to happen ill play this game even more.the farming is kinda getting hard for me but still fun nontheless.",Positive
"Could never get into other Hoyo titles for whatever reason, but man does Honkai just hit every note I need checked. The turn based combat is a nice change of pace from usual games, and I always feel like I am rewarded when I grind for banners. As a free to play player, I absolutely will recommend this game to any fan of turn based combat, and the story actually keeps me engaged which is awesome.",Positive
"Need more action in the battle phase like using item,defend flee from battle, or QTE like asura warth and make some enemies need some strategies for us to defeat them also please add summoning system on all world ( no just in hertha world )and make the summoning animation more breath taking like FF. It will be nice if we can have mini game in the train like build the train some facilities that we can use or decorating the train",Negative
"Star Rail is overall an excellent game and it's a must try for those who are big fans of hoyoverse's games or rpg games! The character designs are just chef's kiss and I love how intricately designed the world is. However, I've been constantly facing login error issues and the cutscenes would sometimes lag or not the audio of said cutscenes would stutter. Pls fix it asap üòîüòî",Positive
BEST UPDATE EVER! the songs is so good! Still there a bugs but the new update is beautiful...,Positive
I'm giving it a 2 stars because everytime in exploration progess 6 in domain combat I always gets stuck there because there is no enemy. I even restard my run and restarted the game but still nothing changes. Please fix it Hoyoverse. Thank you. Edit: It's working fine again Thank you!,Positive
"This game becomes very broken and poorly optimized at level 50+ (Star Rail lvl) the grind for character boosting items becomes so slow that by the time you evolve your character you will be 3-4 levels behind where you should be. Also, the daily quests rewards are not appropriate for high end players. The rewards are what you expect if you are at level 10. Please fix your end game content rewards and balance it out for those who are there already.",Negative
"Its the same old gacha system gameplay , but with the most beautiful character designs and environment details, and extremely immersive experience and story. Only downside is that you get to the endgame content fairly quick . And the saddest thing about playing HSR is that once you start building characters seriously, trailblazer energy is the only barrier for us to continue playing . Once we finish our 240 energy ( 4 runs of calyx is enough to finish it , so around 10mins) we are done playing.",Positive
Please make it so that we could listen or make a way that we can choose a music to listen to in battle.i like robin song about hope is the thing with feather.it make me could defeat gold and gear easily.,Positive
"It's a pretty cool and great game based on what I got to, cute and well made characters, simplistic yet fun combat mechanics, and an interesting story although to be fair I didn't see it all, I only got to the first main boss battle, but if you're gonna play this game make sure you have a phone or other device that can handle it, I have a moto G stylus which isn't to old but definitely not good enough to handle the game, I didn't crash but there was a pretty good amount of lag",Positive

5 out of 5 everything perfect just wish I can repeat the story cause it's isn't enough to see such a masterpiece once,Positive
"def my fav game, I have been waiting for this game for so long and it's finally here!! Haven't experienced any bugs so far and the gameplay and the game itself is really smooth. Easy to play and understand, though, genshin impact is still slightly a bit better. Not a fan of turn based rpgs. Overall, good game!! 5 stars.",Positive
"A lot of potential to be one of the greatest JRPGs alike thanks to its GaaS roots... if you are able to pass the weird gacha dissonance (multiple characters that don't belong to a place in the story, characters that are in your crew but only playable if you are lucky from the pulls, unique equipment/gear only acquired by pure luck, etc.) Everything else? Is just great. The story is still cooking but the characters and the plethora of content makes it worth the ride.",Positive
"I really really enjoy playing this game, but it keeps crashing over and over again. At first it worked and I played for awhile, but after playing the second time it kept crashing, and the only way that I can play again is by redownloading the whole thing. Even genshin is far less laggier than this game. Please optimize this game on more devices. Thank u :(((",Negative
"v1.0 worked just fine on my phone (im a low end device user) and overall i really love the game but after v1.1, the train on the loading screen was cut into half and everything just flickers in-game, some portions of the floor gone, animations are wonky and it lags so much. worst of all, i can't log in anymore because the game always crashes before it can get past the loading screen. i was saving up for kafka and now I can't even play the game anymore, please fix this hoyo.",Negative
"Unique battle mechanic for a turn-based RPG. Voice acting, music, & delivery of the storyline are great. It's good so far, but I encountered a few bugs (e.g. one of the WANTED posters was invisible to me & I used 40 TP to claim a reward in SU, but didn't get any Relics). Imo, Relic farming & lvling costs too much TP. It'd be nice if we could use buff/healing items during battle. It'd also be nice if we could view the file size for each resource dl before we dl it, esp when playing on data. Tq~",Positive
I love the fighting animation for each unique character and the story plot but favorite one would be main character's personality,Positive
"Really fun gameplay-loop and a pretty good story to go with it. The word feels alive (imo), interesting characters. Nice early game, exploreion is rewarded. but does have a stamina system which can gets frustrating when you're trying to farm materials for characters. A couple annoying audio bugs in cutscenes. (Overall I can recommend this if you like turn based rpg's with a little gacha on the side.) [Needs more minor bug fixes] [8/10]",Positive
I love this since start but recently after update we discover that the game crash after breaking a weakness in simulated universe elite boss and also after some times is crash and pause the screen 3 to 5 mins please resolve the problem as soon as possible because I want to play freely as before,Positive
"I finally contact the CS and yes finally i can log in but now come a new Problem. It's a texture bug and affect the environment of my gaming. I didn't get this kind of bug before in 1.0 but it start to gnawing my gameplay in 1.1. I hope they fix it soon. I'll try to contact the cs again later since i can't even do the basic movement without getting crash. I'm sorry i made a lot of complaint but i can't even enjoy the gameplay at all. I'm looking forward towards the change, thank you.",Negative
"This game fundamental is very good. But progressing is too painful and not rewarding. The effort to complete challenges is not equal to the reward. Daily, weekly, monthly reward so small. Very expensive stamina for very small drop material to upgrade for one character. And more importantly LACK OF CONTENT to do when zero energy.",Negative
Love the game But I feel like quitting it for long time ago because of the combat difficulty and the monotony of the aleatory forced combat with enemies and events are more combat.. My complain is that they make enemies extremely strong in hp and also. They make several waves of enemies and on top of that enemies cheat doing extra attacks turns and also they don't die. In the 1%hp so 3 turns more. This make every combat last long long time. Repetitive and much time every encounterer.,Negative
"Its a great game but please represent more skin tones and stop being racist, I'm talking about Arlan; His skill names etc need to be changed ( It should be obvious which ones they are ), what kind of stupid joke is that? Its not even funny or nice, it's just plain racist. Otherwise it's a good game, fun storyline every now and then but I'm keeping it a 1* till you add some more representation and fix Arlan's skill names etc, please, thanks.",Negative
"This is one of my favorite turn based games ever. The team behind this pump out so many rewards and cool characters in each patch, and it overall feels more rewarding than some other games ive played. Frankly, I genuinely enjoy playing everyday as a fun way to destress after my daily routines and work and such, even if it is a strategy game, purely because of how genuinely well thought out the characters and their playstyles are.",Positive
"The ultimate turn-based adventure experience!! Fun and Comedic lines by the characters included, please try to play it at least once! Recommended for all including F2Ps!!! (Cutscenes kind of lags due to not-so-strong internet connection even if I toned down the image quality or FPS but doesn't ruin the overall play experience)",Positive
The storyline graphics and basically every event is good and also super f2p friendly. My reason for the three star despite all these positive points is because of the bugs. I play on my phone most of the time and it is slow to catch up to the actions performed and has absolutely ruined the experience for me. The cutscenes audio is always stuttering which breaks the immersion.Please do something about it and fix these bugs.,Negative
An amazing RPG with developers who really care about their community. One of the most player friendly gacha games with generous and regular rewarda on top of an engaging and visually stunning combat system. Mihoyo has been delivering QOL updates every patch and the only thing that could use some streamlining in my opinion is relic farming.,Positive
"Previous review is what happens when you drop your phone and don't realize what you did. I really enjoy the game a lot and story line is fantastic! It's got some gacha pitfalls, but, overall highly enjoyable.",Positive
I have been playing this games for three months the only problem is the lag the game is really laggy especially when cutscenes occure,Negative
"The game is good and just like the other game Genshin Impact, its QoL is getting better and better. But i do have one thing to complain about setting, I have to redownload voice language that I set in the previous patch. I dont mind waiting but this problem could be done during updating the patch instead of doing it again every new version. I hope you guys solve this and reply so I can give more star.",Positive
"I was very hyped for Honkai: Star Rail and it surprised me on how good games like this can be fun and challenging at the same time. But since the movement are based on genshins open world movement, a game that leaves jumping out atleast in the free roaming section feels very weird since it can be used for a lot better experience in the open world section. But even without the jumping. It's an incredible game.",Positive
"It's very very addicting and you can have many characters just by playing it for days or seconds and it has good graphics, characters and places and it had a beautiful story line and of course my favorite character their is Mr ratio having big damage with his calk and of course to all who is having two thoughts on downloading this game , I will just say this game is 5 star for me because it's an amazing game hope you download and experience the same as me! üòáü•≥",Positive
100 free pulls is a lie. 10% combat 90% boring.,Negative
"Play it on PC and on my pixel 7. Runs great. Excellent story. Sweet graphics and cinematics. Amazing music. Cute characters with flashy animations. A game like this requires some time Investment, it's marathon not a sprint. Enjoy the content and look up guides are if you want a smoother adventure",Positive
"Every single gripe and quality of life issue I had with Genshin has been alleviated. I find the story much more interesting, the characters as well. Choosing to develop a turn based was a great choice and there's no shortage of people out there that need to try it before you knock it. This game is really fun. Just great.",Positive
"Nice, everytime i tried to login. I keep stuck on the black screen. Very good.",Negative
"It's really fun game. Although it may lag or crash on some devices. But it's running smoothly on my device. I've been playing for several hours continuously without any kind of crashing ü•∞ Maybe it crashes on those devices which aren't compatible. So before complaining about game, maybe people should try this game on other compatible devices.",Positive
"Another Masterpiece from the Hoyoverse. Star Rail has the best feeling for playing anime likes games. The character design and the story is just amazing. It is very good for Casual player also cause you don't have to much. But the problem is the resources like ""Jades"" it is limited for now as the game is not really an open world game and still progressing. As the early starter it is really fun to play ""I will still recommend it to give it try for once"".",Positive
"Add an option to reduce game size, 20gb+ is to big",Negative
"Pretty cool game good performance good gameplay but please reduce the size, it a pretty great game but the storage size is outrageous",Negative
I love the game. Reminds me of ff games. Story is good graphics are good and the music is topnotch! I've noticed some graphic glitches on reflective surface getting pixelated and overheating at max settings. Hopefully this will be fix in the future.,Positive
the turn based gameplay isnt interesting at all you cant use potions/consumable mid combat or swap characters mid combat there's no complexity in the turn based. the complexity is ont he farm where u have this stupid relics/artifact gate that also exist so you have to grind a lot of things which is not fun at all for progressing the story. the turnbased combat doesn't provide you with outplay or you cant outsmart any overworld enemy it's really stats based turn based.,Negative
"I never really enjoyed the chore-like gameplay of Genshin when I tried ot years ago, but I've always been a massive fan of turn based rpgs. This game has provided me with a lot more entertainment than I expected. The characters are well designed and entertaining. The sidequests can be a bit tedious, but that's true for most games. Star Rail's dev team has been really consistent quality wise, and generous with the rewards which makes it easy to tell they're dedicated. Next update looks crazy too.",Positive
"I love the game, I haven't experienced any bugs yet, but since the game is in it's first stages, bugs are bound to happen. Overall, the graphics are top tier, the voice acting is really good, the story line, the playstyle, and the characters are really good. I recommend this game if you like gacha games.",Positive
"(LOVE THE GAME) I stopped playing this game simply due to story derailment. The game story is centered around the new characters, and not the main character. It has been a year i believe or close since launch, and the game takes forever to progress with the main story. Because the game is built around everyone else besides the main character i got bored. I don't care about the all white/Asian characters, all i want is to know the main characters story and that won't be done till probably 2029+.",Negative
"Fun game! Could never get into Genshin Impact because of the combat. But this being turn based is much more my style. Characters are great. Story can be interesting, but also kinda meh. Standard gacha stuff and can be grindy in the late game or when you get a new character. But not super pretatory monetization. And the developer has a pretty good reputation for not being extremely pretatory in the long run.",Positive
"Game was fine. Good story as far as I got. But I HATED the battles. You'd come across a monster, hit it AND THEN go to an actual fighting scene. And, it's like a turn thing. You take turns attacking. It got tiring after a bit",Negative
"I hate to say it, but this game is already way superior to Genshin Impact in so many ways. The characters are gorgeous and I love how unique they are with varied weapons and fighting styles, that paired with the turn based combat makes this incredibly fun and smooth to play. The story is already engaging and the music is catchy. I enjoy being able to do quests at my own pace and stumble across random little side quests that add nuance to the NPCs and the world.",Positive
"Upon update with blade, the game is almost unplayable, I have done everything, gone through all the settings, and I can no longer get into battle, it will crash my game every time and now I am unable to play the events and will miss out on a lot of things, for a phone that ran genshin rather fine, this games optimization is terrible and should only be run on a high end phone or phone with a ton of space for the pre-download.",Negative
This is an addictive game first phone game i play all the time and cant put donw most of them i drop after a week but the story is pretty good turn based combat is amazing most phone games that do it just feel meh. Progression is set up good where i dont feel im leveling to unlock next story quests but to make my team stronger there is trailblazer level then ur teams individual levels that are raised differently. The rps and world are set up pretty good and has light exploration.,Positive
"I love your game, but you guys have to learn to optimize your games for mobile. Your latest update has bulged this game to a point I almost can't fit it on my phone. Mobile games should never be around 20 or more gigs(they should top out at 12 tops after years of updates) as the play store shows as only about half a dozen of the worst optimized games are and you guys make 3 of them. Plz optimize your games for a more mobile friendly experience.(as it is you are more a PC/console game maker)",Negative
"Not quite smooth on midrange phone with low settings, a few dips in frame rate after a while. Story and characters are great paired with amazing soundtrack. The gacha is also more generous as they give you free tickets for pulls. Would recommend and it's not too demanding in terms of grinding and leveling up",Positive
"This game is a lot more F2P friendly than genshin ever has been. I can consistently get characters I want and when I do fail the 50/50 most of the standard banner 5 stars are usable in some way minus Yanqing. The gameplay is amazing too, I love the flashy ultimates and crazy looking enemies. The story is pretty good, and the upcoming stories seem to have a lot more at risk because characters can actually die compared to genshin offing side characters from backstories only.",Positive
"Graphics are standard, nothing as was expected from Hoyoverse considering their old games, character designs and storyline is subpar, but the battle style instead of being third person playstyle they chose to make it a turn based action RPG ruins it all. The reason i give it a 1 star is because of how boring and a waste of time it all is with this particular game release. Just play Genshin Impact if you want, that's leaps and bounds better than whatever waste of space this is.",Negative
"While the gacha system can be rough at times, the game is fairly generous and has multiple events per month and new substories with each character release to earn a ton of currency. The music, voice acting, the gameplay... exceptional. If you like dynamic turn based rpgs with very refined mechanics that require puzzle-like problem solving to beat some content, start playing!",Positive
A really fun turnbased. For a comedy game there's a lot of intense and cool scenes that really make you care. It's gacha is way better than hoyos usual garbage and collecting and building much more satisfying. I like that all characters are pretty much usable so you can select ur favorites. It's really fun with low and high investment. Nice puzzles and a fun time.,Positive
"Similar to Genshin in some ways, but improved massively in ways Genshin needed but never got. That said, the pull system still kind of sucks. You got cones mixed in with character pools, and if your unlucky say like me, you are going to find yourself with more cones and no characters to use them. The game heavily encourages you to give them money. That said, you can play free, but expect slow progression. It's a great game though better than Genshin for sure.",Positive
"It's such a fun game so far. Hope you all are working hard on a new update. I do have to say, and I've seen others mention this, the Luofu story mission does seem a bit unfinished, but I can understand why. Developing games isn't the easiest, but you all are doing such great work, and I hope you're able to push out an update for this in the near future. Controls are easy to use, the story is fun and easy to follow, and the overall character design is amazing. Thank you for making a great game.",Positive
"Sometimes it won't open If this happens to you just click ""update"" on the side it will verify and it will open :D",Positive
There is no sound (T-mobile REVVL 5G) but it's a great game. The cutscenes are also laggy AF,Positive
"This is by far my favorite game rn. It breaks my heart that I had to uninstall because it's ridiculously massive! At the time my phone was full, it registered as 37gb, but after I uninstalled, I had 43gb free! Insane! I just recently got a Galaxy Tab, so hopefully, it can handle that. Seems to handle PGR just fine, so we'll see!",Positive
The art is absolutely amazing and the amount of things you can do in the game is amazing and you can explore many places and open chest and collect really nice characters with each character you provides a new power for your experience as well. It's a amazing game in my opinion.,Positive
"Game was running fine in 1.0 but after the new patch, the game crashes everytime and I have been searching for a fix but to no avail. The only things I found was from other players who are experiencing the same problem, they contacted customer service and they were told to check the compatibility of the device or BUY a new phone, which is really sad tbh. The 1001_3 error was fixed but there's new bigger problem. Giving 2s for now, will change to 5s if fixed. 2s for effort in fixing 1001_3",Negative
"I would give it a 5 besides the fact it sometimes gets really buggy if you stand or put your camera in the wrong place. Currently I have a march 7th merged with a wall that I found to be walk-through-able. Other than a few glitches or visual bugs that aren't important, it's a great game!",Positive
I like how it is semi-sandbox/semi-railroad. I recommend to people who like futuristic D&D.,Positive
"Absolutely amazing gameplay. Really changes how you view mobile as a gaming platform. Wasn't a huge fan of Genshin Impact, but this one is extraordinary. Love the game in all its features an updates. My only gripe with the game is the immense cost if you wanted to play the full game with every character, but it's a free-to-play so I can't hold that against its score.",Positive
This is by far one of the best mobile games I have ever played. You guys really done a phenomenal job. Lots to do storyline is solid yet mysterious. Graphics and artwork is amazing. I can't find any complaints. And it's FREE to play Keep up the good work. A definite 5 stars ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,Positive
"best story based game hoyoverse every made, and quite generous which genshin never was and the devs actually listen and deliver instead of ignoring the players like the devs in genshin does.",Positive
"Started since first minute of official opening, been playing it whenever I have time and can't stop thinking about it. Story so far (4/5), little confusing with almost no explanation, but overall very light hearted and quite silly. Gives off Star Ocean vibes as you travel to less developed planets. Music (4/5) not as good as Genshin, just bunch short synth tracks on repeat. Gameplay (5/5) is turn based RPG, best comparison is Shin Megmi Tensei series, that plays on action order and weakness.",Positive
"This is the 6th time I've had to reinstall this godforsaken game since the moment I keep my phone unattended for thirty seconds or literally open a webhook from WITHIN THE APP the entire screen stutters everytime I try to reopen it and the app just breaks, forcing me to restart my phone. It was working fine before, why is it like this???",Negative
Underwhelming. Each character has 2 abilities but there's only a few characters in the game. There's just not much to it. I don't see a reason to spend money considering there is no end game competitive aspect the game whatsoever. This should be a $9.99 single player game with no microtransactions. What am I even paying for? Why do I even need these new characters? There's no one to show it off to anyway!,Negative
"Honestly one of the best gatcha games out there it's really fun and has amazing story, music & characters also I love firefly",Positive
Problem fixed when login error. Cause: internet problem. Can't wait for Sam/Firefly ‚ù§Ô∏è,Positive
"I really enjoy this game, I've been playing for over a year, and I'll continue to do so, but I'm unhappy with the clear favoritism towards waifus. Pulling for Boothill and then announcing nerfing break damage before 2.3 feels like a sick joke. Although I don't care too much about meta, I still want to be able to progress while pulling for characters that I like, but it feels very discouraging when you have units like Acheron and soon-to-be released Firefly. Please give husbandos more love too!",Negative
"One thing I don't like about this game is that the game could give up when connection is low and not even try to reconnect again, instead the game restart from beginning. Performance? Still suck and not efficient. Gameplay? It's alright although Turn-Based is not my taste. What about character model? I'm gonna say they still reusing assets from their previous games",Negative
"Same problems with genshin hold this one back. Energy system is far too restrictive you basically can't play the game much less tackle the terrible rng on gear or stats. Content is so easy its braindead. We have heard of possible co-op and raids and quite frankly if they don't manage to nail an endless grindable rewarding area for hardcores desiring high challenge, this one's life will be even shorter than genshin's. We NEED endgame content to keep the game playable between patches.",Positive
"Better than Genshin. It's so weird, its like they found a formula after Genshin and they want to replicate everything about it in this new game. I'm scared they'll also do the same in newer titles. Not like it's a bad thing, at least financially for Hoyoverse. Still is a bit odd how, despite being a turn based game in the Honkai verse, it manages to feel so much like Genshin. The ultimate abilities have similar conditions to charge up, the way you level up characters, and so much more. Still fun",Positive
The game crashes everytime I try to initiate a mission trigger that enters into a cutscene. For example When I go to the mission trigger when investigating Chris for suspicious activity it just freezes and crashes as well as any other similar mission trigger. Please fix because it has become unplayable.,Negative
Love the game so far story graphics lore characters design is amazing had a wonderful experience but one thing that I don't like is that it isn't much optimized lags alot especially in smartphones my device does meets requirements game like genshin impact runs pretty smooth but I don't know what is wrong with this game hope the Devs fix this issue in next patch.,Positive
Hoyo's Colorism is upsetting and there should be a variety of skin tones that are not just white.,Negative
"I've had a lot of fun with this game so far, I came from genshin for the turn based and a fresh start and I'm very happy with that choice.",Positive
"Okay the game is fantastic, incredible, immersive, amazing, storyline-ccentric, I love it, but the major problems that I encounter is the log-in screen. Whenever I try to log-in it keeps saying ""Log-In Problem Error: 1001_1"" as it prevents me to ever play the game. My connection is fine and I can browse and surf the web casually, please fix this, it is frustrating.",Positive
Great game but takes a ton of space. I'm starting to think this is the way they seel the 512 gif drives,Positive
"I hope devs makes a lot of quest or mission in the future to get trailblazer exp, im stuck at trailblazer 47 :( Edit: im already trailblazer 70 lol",Positive
"I actually really like it,I was surprised by it,this style isn't my type but I actually really like this game",Positive
"I've just pre-installed the game on my phone and PC (now i'm just waiting for the PS4 release), I can just tell by the graphics that this game will surpass Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd! Can't wait to play this on the 26th when it comes out!! Edit: They cancelled the ps4 ver :( Edit 2: I got my ps5 for ny bday 2 months back, it's all good!",Positive
"I have high end device with sd 8 gen 1. The game run very smooth in battle, dialogue, etc. But the cutscene run very choppy. It stuttering either the video and sound. I don't have this issue when playing genshin. I have tried to lower the settings but still the same",Positive
Good game nice systems and everything just really great but the new update has some type of audio bug I thought it was lag but it not in multiple cutscenes in the new trailer blazer quest it hard to hear people talk during them it like it been distortion and like bass boosted im stuck in a cool cutscenes when we cut to the shackles prison every time I play the game and don't want it to be ruined by this audio problem but I want to move forward still i hope they fix this soon,Negative
"I have played since release and have been enjoying the game. The first event was very disappointing, but it seems the future events will be much more interesting. The rates have been ok for me. If you were to tally my pulls I think I would be very close to the advertised rates. The story and music are amazing. Looking forward to future updates. Edit: The new 1.1 update made the game more unstable. So many crashes and black screens after the battle is over. Fix this.",Negative
"Good game, great story and beautiful characters but there's a few problems. It drains too much battery and it also heats up my phone after playing for an hour. I don't know why that happens because I have a high end device with plenty of storage and it shouldn't heat up like that. Please fix that problem because I would love to continue playing but I don't wanna risk getting my battery damaged.",Negative
"Highly recommended, great graphics Fantastic gameplay and story. Uses turn based combat systems, so it's not very hard. They really put a lot of work into this, much appreciated, and I hope there will still be much to see in future times",Positive
"It's a fun game! and cool character's, story quest ,world and graphics... speaking of graphics i have little problems about it , sometimes when i log in on the game it always go clear like the floor i will se the gray sky instead even the building will go blank when i move idk how to explain this but that's what i experience",Positive
"(THIS POST WAS SPONSOURED BY THE SAMPO DEBT COLLECTORS COMMITTE) Honkai Star Rail is probably one of the most addictive games I have ever played. You got turn-based combat, interesting stories and missions, and eyecatching character designs (points to Sampo). I was so in love with the game that I bought a PS5 and started playing it on there!",Positive
"It was fun at first. Now its just too repetitive, after completing the story, & lvling up completely. The game gets boring around Trailblazer, lvl 50. So, got about 20 lvls of grinding that just sucks. Same animations over & over again. Plus, ticket draws are god awful when trying to get characters or good cones. Spent $120 only got 2 decent characters & 1 good cone, rest was bs. Uninstalling.",Negative
"I love this game, I personally like Serval because of her aesthetic and game play but I don't like is that I can't choose a very high quality or any quality except very low. When I do, the whole place is gotta light up almost everything except for the characters. Please fix this, it ruins the quality of the game.",Negative
"I still play this daily even though I've completed it to where the game currently pauses, and omg, it is still so much fun. The characters and quests are fun and enjoyable, I'm loving sitting back and making my own romance between these powerful and cool characters. Genuinely, no complaints at all about this game, I recommend it to those who live adventuring, fighting and just good times!",Positive
"The game is very good, as a player i really enjoy playing no lag recently but as the new version came in I've been encountering problems but most of all when i launch the app, when i go to the train part it just stop responding or it said that it's stopped, so i wished that this error will fix as soon as possible üòî ---------------------------------------- Nevermind my phone just sucks and sorry for not noticing üòÖ ZEHAHAHA great game after all and it's got more rewards than usual.",Positive
"Great PvE game that really doesn't need you to spend AT ALL. Engrossing story, funny and engaging dialogue that you actually want to read. Great gameplay with multiple puzzles (unfortunately they are not unlimited) that comes with great rewards if you complete them and more ! exciting for the future of this game !",Positive
By far the best experience I've had with a mobile game. Plenty of events and added enjoyment built in. The app runs great on my phone. Never had a serious problem with a bug and the translations have been good to great. Ive been playing since release and have gotten all my friends to come play. Only thing missing is a way to get rewarded for the people you get to sign up.,Positive
"Good game, but I really miss an auto route function to move on with the quest when I don't have the time to walk and explore the game's world. I really want to collect the characters and farm to build them, but I don't have time to walk all the time, and thus I'm already left behind on the hype train.",Negative
"Fantastic. Genshin players will be pleased if they are wanting to try TBC, along with experiencing features that Genshin players have been asking for since launch. Absolutely must try. The characters are fun to play, with amazing stories and world-building, and awesome combat mechanics, especially in end game content.",Positive
"Best turn-based game for those who hate turn-based games. Design/story/music aside, it's doable. Genshin/Honkai fans that hate turn-based combat might like Star Rail. Here's why. No MP or HP to keep track of. You can always regenerate what you need. Battle forever. There's very limited skills (3 per character) and you don't have to fear ""skill 2/15 uses left"" Roles are easy to understand Autoplay shorter battles When your ultimates charged, you don't have to wait your turn to deploy it.",Positive
"Super beginner and f2p friendly actually better than most games that claim to be ‚Äúfree to play‚Äù. Sure there's a grind as with any game but with Starrail the grind feels very VERY rewarding. At first I was overwhelmed to play a Honkai cause with others the grind is very hard or requires a lot of steps before hand but with Starrail it's very open and very casual, meaning you don't have to wait a certain day to receive a certain item you're looking for. Definitely give Star Rail a chance!",Positive
"Incredible!‚òÜ I used to dislike turn based RPG games as I'd find them slow and boring. However, Honkai Star Rail is beyond amazing! The unique storyline so far is wonderful and captivating along with the exceptional graphics! The music is wonderful and I find myself humming it a lot. The characters are beyond amazing and I adore all of them for sure!‚ô° Coming down to the actual game play, it isn't boring at all. It keeps you engaged and it's so enjoyable! 10/10‚òÜ",Positive
They are deceptive. They word it so that you think they are going to give you 80 pulls up front. Fact is you are going to have to earn the 80 pulls. Also they give you more light cones than anything esle. Light cones are useless when you do not have the appropriat character to use them on. I have 20+ 4 star light cones and only 1 character that can use just 1 of them. It is just as stingy are the other 2 impact games. Reward vs time are not worth my time or space on my device to keep playing.,Negative
"I like the game. Fun, unique and interesting characters, plus a good story. The main thing I'd say is Stellar Jades are a bit hard to get. If there would be a way to get more so they aren't as rare, it'd be appreciated. Edit: It's a bit hard to get 5 stars. It's almost as if the whole game centers around it. Pull rates are almost like Genshin's now...",Positive
"The game has excellent visualization and funny storytelling but some flaws. First, the turn base combat system with a complete virtual gamepad causes unnecessary and complicated player control. Mobile games control should be as simple as possible. Second, the story cannot skip or faster. There is a lag on each line that stops you from clicking the dialog. Very annoying. Some people may like the story, but others just want to skip it. Give the player a choice, please.",Negative
This is an amazing game! But I do wish we could change our equilibrium levels because it is definitely a help for people who need more time to be able to properly build their characters to take on higher level monsters. I also feel that it will be an amazing addition to the game even if it is just a small change.,Positive
"While the gameplay is good, it is very repetitive, it is easy to quickly level up characters. Gatacha system for new ones, with a pity system so it's great. Story is brilliant. MAJOR complaint about the HUGE amount of text though. You can speed it up a little bit but cannot skip it, 90% of your time will be taken up by reading text. Massive turn off.",Negative
"Unfortunately after the 1.5 update today, the game runs extremely slow. And I mean choppy, freezing, stuck on the menu screen for minutes slow. I reinstalled the game multiple times, but I don't recommend doing this, as redownoalding the resources when the main screen itself is slow means you got to wait about 20 or so minutes of an agonizingly slow and freezing train. Maybe it'll be fixed, maybe it won't. Who knows. For now, because it's literally unbearable to play, I don't recommend this.",Negative
"Suuuper good!! The events are rlly good, Graphics of the game is outstanding!! The storyline is absolutely amazing, Charathers designs are very pretty & handsome! But, I have been seeing an issue lately with the game, Its smooth and all, But when cutscenes happens, Its so laggy! My storage is completely fine, The video cutscene isnt really that laggy, But! When theres an cutscene playing and the video is good, The audio always cuts off! The audio is very laggy! Please fix these immediatly.",Positive
"There is no hate for this game , all things are top notch the graphics, the story, the characters all of them but, I really hate is the combat style it's not for me I don't like ""robotic "" combat style,there I have to wait for enemy's attack then my attack will come , and there no dodging bro I mean I am a genshin player to dodging is a part of an attack, again I don't hate this game but it's not for me if they change the combat style then I will play this game again. Anyways love u hoyo.",Negative
"Game is boring. Long introduction. Why make movement ""free-roam"" if the combat will be turn-based? It makes the game's rythm way too slow and at the same time uninteresting. Either keep it as a fully turn-based game, no movement. Or make it a fully free-roam with real-time combat. You are just combining the two worst parts of each if you stay halfway.",Negative
"I love turn based games, and this is perfect for me. There is a starting screen meant to load data and login if needed. Sometimes the game gets stuck on that, and i have to close the game for it to get past it. Sometimes, it only takes one try, sometimes multiple..",Positive
Perfect game. I main Kafka and I LOVE HER SO MUCH! I play the game on my pc. I tried to download it in my phone but when I open it I see nothing but pink screen. My phone is old though that might be the reason but Honkai Impact works perfectly. ANYWAY I'M IN LOVE WITH THE AWARDS! LIKE THE AWARDS ARE INSANE! THE GAME IS SO FUN TO PLAY AND THE CHARACTER DESIGNS ARE FIRE!,Positive
"The game is the first turn based i played since final fantasy and it was amazing. I might be biased but i think 4 star characters is better than 5 star but it's my personal preference. But please please please fix the login error, that's the only thing that kept me away from this game.",Positive
"Gameplay, characters, and storyline is great, but some translations need further reviewing though. Game does not work when using mobile data. Even if connection is stable and I can play genshin, I can't run Honkai Star Rail no matter how many times I've resetted my connection. That's why I can rarely play it.",Negative
Been playing since release. Overall I have a decent experience with this game. Although when you get to higher end content some stuff kinda requires you to have certain characters. You can always do workarounds with ftp characters but it will take longer. Some content is definatly made to sell you certain characters. Anyway I've run out of stuff to do in this game and the last story update was meh? I feel like soon I wont play it as much anymore. You'll like it if you like story driven games,Positive
It's an amazing game!!! but we actually need a co-op mode please...,Positive
The best turn based game. Reminds me of old school final fantasy. The dialogue choices are interesting. A lot of Team composition. Story isn't the best but still enjoyable. Drop rate is much better than the other game. Free characters are super useful as well.,Positive
"Simply just a fantastic experience. This is what happens when another eden becomes 3D. And combat system is so innovative. It's very satisfying. As a person who likes turn based game, there is nothing better I could ask for. Absolutely love this. But....hoping the heating issues will be resolved....",Positive
It's a pretty alright game ^^ the controls could be better but you'll learn how to adapt to them. The characters are likeable and the combat is also nice. But this is a hit or miss type of game. If you don't like how the maps and combat are... You'll lose interest fast.,Positive
"I love it a lot. I'm not the biggest fan for turn based combat, but the ultimates and skills, the characters, the music and environment and the STORY all makes up for it. There's even cute humorous things in the game that I enjoy a lot when I interact with certain things that actually made me crack up a lot. I'm in love with the concept of the game and the environment, and I'm excited to begin my journey and build one big family üò≠",Positive
"This game is sooo fun, when you actually get to have fun. It's well polished, great story & combat, fun personalities, etc., BUT a TON of it is running around & talking. TOO MUCH TALKING! The action is so little compared to the amount of conversation & info gathering, that I literally fall asleep & almost uninstalled it. I'm level 15 now & it's STILL very little action. It just seems like an intentional waste of my time. I really like the story but dialogue is way too much! 4 stars",Positive
"The game is overall pretty good, but the graphics are just low quality for some reason even with max graphics. I was looking forward to get 80 wishes, but instead they didn't give me any? Checked the news and the stuff trying to get 80 wishes. I did not get it in the end lol. Still a good game, recommended on PC, or laptop though.",Positive
"I started playing on PC and I have it on my phone for those days away from home where I need to run my daily tasks or use my trailblazer power, the build crafting is amazing, story is awesome, music is great, there is always events coming out to obtain the stellar jade's to pull characters. Im happy with this game and would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys turn based build crafting games, just spend responsibly.",Positive
"I really like Star Rail, I do. My wife, daughter, and I each have our own accounts that we played to TB level 60ish. We login everyday. Star rail has achieved success and has made lots of money, deservingly. However, while ahead, it has not sought to further increase its quality. Instead, it has chosen to squeeze out as much money from users as possible. What drew me to the game previously was its great production quality, lore, story, and characters. Even if the fights got repetitive, I was ex",Negative
This game is amazing and fun I loved it but I had to update it but I accidentally Deleted it and I'm trying to re-download it but it keeps pending and doesn't move overrall this game is amazing and fun the characters are Alot and There's Alot of Stuff to do different enemies this game is very fun indeed.,Positive
"Tutorial too fu*king long. Limited function while you're stuck in it. I don't even like this much hand holding in real life. The game looks beautiful though. The combat system is perfect for mobile. The VA is great. Animations are fantastic. I mean, really, the game is honestly breathtaking. Past the tutorial it's 10/10 with new stuff coming out constantly. 3/5 because the hand holding is actually that annoying to me.",Negative
"Very fun game with a steep learning curve at the beginning but it slowly become easy as you get aquited with the mechanics. It is more focus on breaking the shields of enemies to stun them temporarily then dealing damage, the world is quite fun and a lot of references to movies and other games",Positive
"I love this game so much!! I sadly can't play anymore because of storage problem..‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è But I definitely recommend it!! The characters design are amazing, I love how easy it is to get wishes and the game is super generous. They give a lot of free pulls!! The graphics are pretty good too!!",Positive
"Downloading this app and the first thing I experience is bug and lagging. My phone is fine, and my internet is also fine so the app is probably at fault. I do hope they can just download it with a big amount of gb instead of downloading it at few mb then it's loading most of the times. I haven't actually played the game but the fact that it's continuesly crash everytime I download resources makes me lose my patient. I'll download this again after sometime when there's update and such.",Negative
"Pretty good experience so far, a turn base RPG game, if you love this type of games you will mostly love this one. The content is not intense, mostly of the time you spend like 15 mins to clear up you daily missions and collect rewards of the day, so it's very casual. I play this game since it's release like 3 or 4 months ago, I am now at level 67 (capped at 70), and I spend around 15 dollars (monthly and special pass) every month, but I am very happy with all lovely characters I get!",Positive
The game just gets better the longer you play it. Totally worth investing your time and effort.,Positive
"Refreshing gameplay that is quick, efficient and satisfying+ characters that are fun and engaging :) HOWEVER, optimisation issues are severe, can't even adjust graphic settings without crashing my device. This has never happened with genshin or honkai impact 3rd which are even more storage demanding games so im not sure what is up with the game?? But i hope it gets fixed cuz the rating for the game will stay at a 3 w/o a solution",Negative
"Very good graphics, low storage, doesn't have to much flashing lights (etc) in it. Only downside is that it would be better if it had a open wolrd feature so you could play with your friends as it get's a bit boring playing alone.",Positive
"Late updated review. My reload problem has been fixed, and I loved Jarilo-VI and all the characters and story along with it. The luofu is is good so far, but I've finished all the main story and side missions that's available right now before 1.2. 4 stars because I love the game, but all I really have to do now is farm relics and gather stellar from chests (which is a little boring and i dont want to waste my fuel on relics and im running low on chests and stellar üò≠)",Positive
"This is simply another HoYoverse game to meet and raise the golden standard for free to play gacha games. Yes, there are still some ""chores"" to do, but it's a full fledged turn-based RPG. They also seem to be learning from the feedback from other games, and attempting to retain story elements from otherwise time-limited content. It's far from a perfect resolution, but a step in the right direction.",Positive
"Letsss gooo. *Edit: hi, its been a week now from launch and i've been playing this game like a LOT. 100/10 for story i love how you guys make such an interesting story all the time, the soundtrack, the world/characters design also great, and gameplay, i love the gameplay it's such a classic rpg but its mechanics is soo simple that i don't have any problem with it, this game is just great for me XD. P.s: thanks for the bunch of early rewards!",Positive
"I love it. I just hope the characters can jump too and my character can also speak with a voice-over. I love that there is actual conversation happening with some of the main characters but when talking to side characters, there's no voice-over anymore. It just gets boring when it's like that.",Negative
"the only thing I really don't like about the game is that having a character built for basically almost every element is mandatory, else you'll deal a lot less damage. unlike in genshin where you just have the potential to deal so much damage to begin with that resistance doesn't really matter all that much.",Positive
A good game that just end up as Genshin 2. Boring fights and repetitive farming materials,Negative
"This is a fun, polished game. The story is nice and the battle system is well developed. It's a bit stingy on rewards overall (no daily summon, monthly check in won't get you a single summon) but they do compensate with events. Game modes are fun but not plentiful (most are variations of side quests or battle quests, no PvP, no group modes like guilds). Overall I'm liking it a lot and enjoy the casual nature it provides. It hasn't displaced other games I'm playing but it's nice for now.",Negative
"So far, I'm enjoying this game. What I'm impressed most is that even though it's part MMORPG and has many maps and layouts, it's smooth running and never lagged. And though I don't get to customize my own character trailblazer, at least it's smooth gaming and with familiar faces too. March 7th reminds me of Kimberly. Himeko is gorgeous as ever, Bronya and Seele are awesome as always. After latest update today, it hangs at loading screen when it should only last 3 seconds..so sad. Help pls",Negative
I love the game but unfortunately the graphics of the game is still taxing on my device even at very low graphic settings and the environment detail is lacking. It also crashes my phone and forces it to restart. This has lower storage consumption than Genshin Impact but it doesnt work too well on my phone. I tried Genshin Impact on my phone and it worked better than Star Rail when it comes to performance.,Negative
"Turn-based RPG fun. For the most part, can be F2P and still be enjoyable, it just takes slightly longer to gather materials. The characters are memelords sometimes and it's great. Whenever it pops up, AVOID the spam text mission. It was too real. üòÇ",Positive
"OMG. IF YOURE NOT PLAYING THIS GAME YOU HAVE TOüòªüòª one of the main reasons i love this game is because of the music and the combat styles. the characters are each so unique and all are so beautiful and worthwhile! the ascension and progress is similar to that of genshin, but i feel like this game does more better in terms of grinding materials and whatnot, and the wishing system is top tier. this game is worth 6 stars imo!!ü§©ü§©",Positive
"Never had any crash issues. Story is well thought out,side quests are pretty fun to do, although at times, I feel like the game is trolling me. I only wish you could jump and step over curbs, it can get annoying getting stuck on them.",Positive
"The game looks incredible, the combat is amazing but the story is terrible! After the into quest the pacing falls off a cliff and it's a horrendous slog. As a Genshin player it reminded me of Liyue but unlike Genshin, HSR didn't give me characters to keep things interesting in typical gacha fashion I kept getting repeat characters and weapons giving me absolutely no reason to keep playing",Negative
"I love this game, and I think the story is great but some things are wrong with it. Some of the things that need to be fixed are when I try to take it off super low graphics everything but my character turns white and I can't see anything. Another thing that needs fixed is when I use seele's seconds skill in battle with 2x speed on, it messes up the battle animation and does like a 360 flip with the camera. Othen than this I highly recommend this game.",Positive
"Overall, the game is great. But, there's a little problem with the game. When there is a cutscene playing, the audio of the cutscene is distorted. I don't know if that is my phone lagging or the game having some bugs but please do something!",Positive
"This game is great, but my ONLY problem is, when you accidentally press the ultimate button when doing a battle. Please Hoyoverse, put a ultimate cancel button. I hope Hoyoverse care about this problems, not only for mobile players, but i believe pc players deal with this kind of problem too.",Positive
"Same as with Genshin, unskippable dialogues are very annoying. Not every player is in for the story. Progression is very very slow, I dont mind paying for characters and the gacha, but once I get them allow me to upgrade them fast...! Let me have multiple combinations of teams, not have to focus on a single comp bc of how much grinding is needed for the late game",Negative
"First impression quickly wears off. After great intro and dramatic story in belobog, lofu is boring and badly written. All events are goofy and try to be funny, I thought it will be different from genshin, but it seems that's mihoyo target audience likes these idiotic quests with no serious story. Also stop using the same enemies over and over again! Come on, this is so lazy.",Negative
"It's the best jrpg game I could ever ask for, reliving the og turn-based format with compelling storytelling and stunning character designs. I love it so much. I can tell that the development team had put in a significant amount of endeavor in making the characters' looks as beautiful as possible paired with suitable personality. It makes these characters look alive with relatable personalities to what we see in others in our every day life. I truly love this game and I wish the best for it",Positive
"This game is awesome and was blown away how good the story it is! This game has stunning graphics! However, this game is only designed for high-end mobile devices. I played this game using my OPPO A96 with 256GB storage and 8gb ram but, the performance is not great. It struggles to run at 30 fps on very low settings so, this game currently has lack of optimization here. Please optimize this game for low-end or mid-range devices so players wont need to worry about lag anymore.",Negative
"Honestly one of the best turn based games ive ever played. The graphics, the artstyle, everything was just so appealing. The endgame content is also quite fun and not TOO repetitive (unlike genshin impact imo). The wishing system is also quite nice. You are guaranteed a 5 star in 50 pulls when you 1st play. Id say its really f2p friendly. The patch rewards are also quite generous. Overall, this game is amazing, need i say more? Im addicted.",Positive
"So far been enjoying every second I play this game. I can even go AFK while farming and be able to do my chores IRL, which is probably one of the goods of turn-based games. It's also pretty easy to level up since the daily missions give so much EXP so the rewards are mmm-mm! There are also a lot of content for gaining gems so I can say that this game is pretty F2P friendly, and it doesn't feel like too much since most of the content resets every weekly anyways. That's all :D",Positive
"Pros and cons for me: The graphics are very good and smooth. Never had a single crash. I like the turn base play, I played Summoners War for years. Not Pay2win. Easy 2 do well with free content.. Cons: No multiplayer and arenas PVP. Big critique. There is Wayyy too much dialogue!!! 65% of game is reading. The story is engaging but leads to nowhere. There's absolutely no content after main story except forgotten hall. There's nothing to keep players playing without PVP. Sadly I left after 3 wks.",Negative
"This is the best Game Hoyoverse has yet made. Each and Every Update makes game more enjoyable, game isnt pay to win either, i have been able to get a nice amount of 5* and 4*s as Free to play player. The Graphics are nice and the performance is really stable too. The only and only issue i have is lack of controller support for my android device, my controller doesn't seem to get recognised in game but works fine with other games that i play. Please add support for more controllers.",Positive
gacha game... if you want clear game contents in high tiers you need spend lot's of time and money.... not really free to play now,Negative
"First off, the turn based system is kinda like persona 3 , in which i very much love, and second, its very rewarding for those who are PATIENT enough and to know the mechanics of the game, and last but not that least, the game is very much smooth on my phone even though im using Huawei Mate 10, an old model with a 4 GB ram, haven't experienced any crashes whatsoever",Positive
"I loved the world building and lore in the game, it feels very lived in. Story and diagolue is immersive, gameplay wise its Turn based, movesets are flashy which is always good. My favourite is definitely the exploration, like talking to npc/s and reading notes/books to understand the world or just monster / treasure hunting.",Positive
"i love this game, i played for a week straight for more than 10 hours each day (i have no life) but now that im at trailblaze lvl 35 i have absolutely 0 missions i can do atm, ofc there's fighting and treasure chests but i like to explore the maps while doing missions. I've looked around a bit for some missions to do but I'm unable to find any so far, all I'm hoping for is some new missions. Because of the fact i cant find many missions, i can't go any higher than trailblaze lvl 35 quickly",Positive
"It's my favorite game currently. Characters, story and graphics are all top notch. I previously wrote that the only issue I had with the game was the low trail blazer power. Guess what, the devs fixed that a patch ago. Hoyo chose the right people to work on this game. They really listen to the players and strives to perfect the game. 10/10",Positive
"As I've rated other games 5* before, this game is going to be 11*. Best dialogue lines I've ever seen that I actually laughed playing a game, engaging turn based combat since you can jump between turns with your ult, epic boss fights paired with epic music (finish Jarillo VI and get it), multiple ways to grind/play daily etc. Absolute blast. F2P friendly too.",Positive
"The plot is amazing and gripping, there's lots of ways to level up quickly and the game controls are simple enough in comparison to other games. I like the fact the tutorial isn't annoyingly in your face and that the main character isn't boring and annoying but actually has some humour and wit. The only issue I found is that I took a week break from playing and my entire account deleted itself, which is annoying. However the games plot is quite fast paced once you get going so I didn't mind.",Positive
"The game feels quite optimized for mobile, it has amazing graphics and I haven't had the usual heating issues that usually come with higher end games. The story so far was pretty interesting, and all characters have great interactions and designs.",Positive
"EDIT : Still, a lot of lagging while battle, sometimes the screen when blank while battle, and recently whenever i used Jingyuan ult, my game will automatically went out and crashed, idk why it just happened when i used Jingyuan ult.. also, when doing manual battle, i still cant change the target. It's so hard to swipe the target left and right.. Plus, my sky's game got a lot of black line (it's been fix before but after the recent update, it back again) Pls fix",Negative
Love the game and the characters are amazing to play. Cant wait to for more new characters to come,Positive
"I have been enjoying this game very much. The turn-based combat is a refreshing change from Hoyoverse's other games. Character and art design is great, and there is plenty to explore. I haven't had any issues with bugs or crashes, unlike some other recent games I tried.",Positive
"i was so excited to play hsr when i first heard of it and was damn near happy when i could play it. and everything was amazing!! the characters, the story and the gameplay are overall perfect! (well, to me anyways cause i know turn-based games aren't for anybody) anyways, i'm looking forward to the updates that are coming to the game ^^",Positive
"I like this game very much and have been playing it since release, but now with the new update I can't do the swarm invasion anymore since for some reason some characters ult just breaks the game like it replays the same ult again while freezing the cutscene here and there. This only happens to certain characters while other characters ult works fine. Please fix this I wanna finish my swarm invasion.",Negative
"Preface: Genshin player since 1.1, newcomer to Honkai Gameplay: one word, Solid. The game offers great variation in character abilities. Really feels like I'm playing a classic PS2 JRPG. (Endgame grind included) Story: here is the main element of this game, and its very well presented. Graphics: a beautiful gameworld to explore, while not too large theres plenty of eyecandy. (There will be plenty of new maps to come as well ^.^) Overall a great game Hoyo happy to be here at launch!",Positive
"I really like this game. So when they released a new quest in 1.1 I thought ""cool I should go do that and see a new character"" but now the game just CRASHES 5 seconds into the cutscene making an infinite loop of opening the game and immediately crashing. Thanks for an extremely fun game I was only able to play for a month. Might check back in 1.2 to see if they bother fixing any bugs.",Negative
Better than genshin for solo players worse than genshin for multi players. Overall a good game. But it needs better than 1 trailblazer power per 18 minutes in the reservoir. A standard of 1 per 18 minutes and a reserve of 2400 is too low to properly take see the overflow as a loss. This loss is almost 1:18 compared to the real count up. Which I have no clue on. But if it was something I knew I would definitely expect it to be 1:2 and no more or no less. Great game with better odds so far.,Positive
"What if the makers of Genshin and HI3 made a space fantasy game inspired by the combat of the Kiseki series. The writing and lore so far have been great, the combat reasonably rewarding and the the game itself runs surprisingly well even on older devices. My only problem is that it's a gacha game. There's not much to be done about it when it comes to Hoyoverse but it doesn't mean I have to like it.",Positive
More rewards and easier artifact substat grind please,Positive
"Storyline is all over the place. It could be really good but you all need to sit down and write out a comprehensive plot. Battle is beyond boring, turn based is fine but how it's operated is bad, the enemies are redundant and boring. I was hoping for an open world scifi and got this instead.",Negative
"Simply amazing. I am not a big fan of turn based combat but this game amazed me with how fast it pulled me in. Have been playing for days now non stop, never been addicted this much before. The only downside is that it's a very heavy game so it drains battery fast and overheats your phone. But besides that, the game itself is amazing. Worth trying.",Positive
"After the update, my account was reset back to where it first start (kafka meet nameless) ü´†ü´† game was fun for me but hmmm dont want to play it anymore",Negative
I have started playing the game a recently and I have really enjoyed it so far. The only thing that has bothered me is that you can't use your Google account to log in on PC. It's annoying for the simple reason that a lot of people have probably logged in with google on their phones and would like to play with the same account on their PC but that is not possible since you don't have thd option to log in with google on PC. In conclusion: please make it possible to log in with google on PC.,Positive
"Even though it has a few minor issues, this game is incredible. Story is deep and immersive, music is great, progression is smooth without spending money, and it keeps getting better with regular updates. Definitely would recommend",Positive
"This game was fun and felt very high quality but there wasn't much campaign to do . So I put it on pause for a year or so now when I go back just downloading the patches makes my phone get extremely hot. No way, I'm not putting up with that.",Negative
"This is a really fun game. I love the story, love that it's turn-based, and I love the sci-fi themes. My only gripe that takes away 1 star is the lack of controller support. If iPhone can have it for the same game, why can't android. If that gets supported in the future it'll be a full 5 star game",Positive
"This is definitely a fun and free game! You can pay for cosmetics, and extra character draws, but you can also progress through free to play! The idea of a train in space is a bit unusual and unique. I also like the occasional silly jokes and references. I generally love space games, and I love this one!",Positive
"I personally love the game, if you are a genshin player (waiting for Fontaine's release) then it's sure to interest you. The characters designs and personalities are top-tier and the turn based battling system is really interesting as someone who doesn't play any other turn based games. Super fun, give it a try :)",Positive
"This game is a lot better than Genshin, that's for damn sure, but please, I'm begging you, like I'm on my hands & knees right now I'm typing this, PLEASE CHANGE THE GEAR SYSTEM! ITS TERRIBLE!! I'm telling as someone whos played both Star Rail & Genshin, I beg of you, change how the gear system works. I wouldn't even care if I had to spend in game credits for decent substats, just do something, anything to change it..",Positive
Honestly one of my favorite games. It should not be compared with Genshin because they are two vastly different games that both provide completely uncorrelated experiences. It is simple and it can get very repetitive but it's still forever changing and it's near impossible to get bored of. I highly reccomend it!,Positive
"Finally, a game where Honkai men are playable. Jokes aside, I played the game during CBT3. Game is easy to understand as you start before getting more complicated in terms of customization for character load outs. Auto battle is an option most battles, though it can be hit or miss during end game. But at least it lowers repetition. Controls are easy to manage as well with little thought needed. Game had potential from the groundwork presented and time will tell how it goes from here.",Positive
"A stellar achievement and very polished game. An actual storyline with characters, game mechanics, visuals and resource management. This game is intended to be a low maintenance side game. Do not binge! Or you will hit a wall and run out of content. F2P friendly, imo you should limit spending so the game is more challenging.",Positive
The Wish system is complete stupidity. You can only get a few passes despite playing for hours. Yes for early game this is not a problem But after level 40+ it becomes impossible The game is not fun anymore.,Negative
"Been playing maybe a year and can genuinely say I've enjoyed more than any mobile game while occasionally playing on PC. Love the characters and really get into the story. Always feel like I've got content to do with a good gain on gems. Also, I feel more successful with obtaining the characters I want over other other games of its kind so that's a nice plus.",Positive
"I really love this game! I am definitely a fan of turn-based combat, and it really feels an RPG game which I am fond of and this is why I don't mind the long dialogues and reading lots of text. Hoyoverse is known to have plot-heavy games, and I do love the lore so far. For those people who complains about it being a downgraded version of its twin game, it isn't. It's just a different gamestyle. If it doesn't work for you, then you should try playing the games that you enjoy.",Positive
Only just started the game. Third tutorial battle froze up three separate times. Each time I closed the app and restarted it until it finally worked. A cutscene also reset when it was working just fine before it reset. Uninstalled immediately. Not spending my time on this.,Negative
"Just a amazing journey to play, love it and it's for everybody who loves ""turn-based Games"".",Positive
"This game is wayy more enjoyable than genshin with every update. Although there's many people talking about power creep, I feel I really doesn't matter as it's not like genshin where if you don't have the right characters, beating abyss and rotations are WAYY harder. Just using the right element to kill the enemies as most DPS characters can clear the hard stages either ways. It also gives wayyyy more breathing room than genshin with the reserve resin system so I can play it own time own target.",Positive
"Basically what you expect from hoyoverse..it's a good game and it's really fun. I enjoy the characters and I enjoy the setting and the overall gameplay experience...however I do wish they added a skip dialogue option (I've wanted it in genshin too idk why they don't let us) Of course you have to mention it's a gacha game so they will always prevent it from getting 5 stars but If you like turn based games,this is a good game to play",Positive
"I love that it blends the casual aspects of most gacha games with the more active events of Genshin. It's a perfect in-between. You can play casual if you want, or you can play committed to the game and have fun either way. It's not the most complex game, or the most difficult. But it's fun, and honestly, that's what matters. The passion and love the developers have for this game just bring it to life. And that passion shines through every corner of every world in star rail.",Positive
"Couldn't even play the game between the handful of GB's you have to download and the constant error reports while downloading it, I couldn't even get to the actual game to play. I ended up giving up and uninstalling.",Negative
This game is fun just like honkai 3rd but there's a few bugs tho i have a problem with wishing/pulling for characters it turns green and my screen would just lag and everytime i log in there's always log in error so i have to restart the game again idk if its because my phone is already 3yrs but yeah i will install it again if the bugs is fixed thanks! Update : It's okay now thank you üòç,Positive
Great game theres a bunch of hot men and women in my opinion. Great story and they give tons of rewards daily.,Positive
"For a turn based combat game it's pretty decent. Art style is cool, voice acting is above average. However The gacha is just as predatory as their other anime rpg game. I was going to give it more of a fair shot even though it's not exactly my type of game... But once I unlocked the gacha and my free 20 pulls I only got two bad 4 stars and the game is not fun enough to re roll. Sorry HSR, those pulls were the make or break for me. Gl to anyone playing!",Negative
"Good story, good designs, and good details. It may be quite hard for a newbie once they reach Equilibrium 1, but its F2P friendly. You'll get 10 pull every month just by logging in, not to mention that the rewards from the events are also satisfying. The Xianzhou stories could've been better, since most of it are more focused on the High Cloud Quintets, there's no much details about the other characters. Though, this game overall is good! (They listen to critics too and they give good rewards.)",Positive
"Hoyverse is really doing a magnificent job , This is a great game. The graphics,the music, the combat system, the character designs everything is perfect. I've nothing to complain about this game , it can be played in low end devices unlike Genshin. Thanks a lot Mihoyo for making this game. I never thought I would enjoy a game that has similar combat system like FGO . You've just nailed it.",Positive
"A great game with great characters and animations . Finally offered a skip button, which if you played genshin its a highly asked for thing lol. The game is very easy to understand and the turn based fighting is a new experiance for me. The music is impressive as well. No complaints!",Positive
"Aside from the gacha mechanics, this game is beautiful and a lot of fun for being turned based. The game is visually amazing and pretty fast-paced with the combat. A lot of the battle animations are just so good. They only issue I have with this game is that there's so much dialog.",Positive
I can't sign in it always say network error when i have a strong network i like the game art its cool but i will it a 3 star,Negative
I must say I really love this game. The trun based fighting system is kinda fun and pretty interesting as it requires some techniques to win perfectly. The story is good and the dialogs are absolutely funny. Also this is a game where f2p can enjoy throughout the whole game so I see no problem at all. I love the BG music too..overall : 5 stars. Wish this becomes more successful.,Positive
"This game fails on so many levels. The RPG mechanics are shallow, the level design is uninteresting, the visuals are bland, the gacha is horrible, the plot is stupid. Only the music and VA performance stand out as positives. This might be one of the most ""style over substance"" games I've seen in years.",Negative
"Everything looks great, i played on mid spec android ( can setting high - don't believe this, Smooth no lag ) , Of course this is turn base game so you can't control your character as you want in battle ( running¬≤ or jumping XD ), but Really love with this game, Simple, fast gameplay and intense battle ( for me ), Enjoy the game & Have fun..!!",Positive
"The game has been more enjoyable now and there are things like the forgotten hall or simulated universe if you have nothing else to do and while the former is more of the endgame challenge, the latter is a good passing time. The relic grinding can be annoying but there are tools that help you to get the relic you want and with something else the specific mainstat you want on it. But substats are still hard to optimise. Overall pretty fun and I'm looking forward to new content.",Positive
"Boring quest designs and Excessive dialogues, stupid minigames, Gameplay loop that becomes tedious, with an Insufferable Grind. The worse part for me: Combat is extremely level and elemental based. If you don't have the right characters (which you can really only get through gambling) or level (which is a chore to do). It's not flexible or fun after a certain point, especially for the main quests. Unlike Genshin, the gameplay is less flexible, but just as boring and time consuming.",Negative
The energy we get are very little that it won't even let us stay in game for like 5min even if we do refill... Very disappointing the resources run out too fast at least could have made it possible to get back energy when we level up our trailblazer but no. we have nothing do to other than waiting 8 hours just to login play 5min and log outüò´üò´enjoyed the story but that's it we want to try other heroes but the resources are keeping us not to play with it... Hopefully the it will be readüò≠,Negative
"Really fun! I am astounded at the level of quality and detail put into the game, and overall you can tell the devs were really passionate about this. The combat is smooth, strategic and fast paced despite being turn-based. The story and lore is extremely interesting, and the characters are loveable. What else is there to say really? A few hours in I am really enjoying it and I recommend it.",Positive
"Grinding for mats isn't really that good because aside from the grinding itself, you're locked by the energy system that takes 60 minutes for 10 energy points. Even if you still want to play, you can't because of this. Overall, game itself is enjoyable. Just hoped that there's still voice acting on side quests to make it engaging, not just on the main quests.",Negative
"The game is very good and everyone is saying that the graphics is good but it crashes over time but I think their mobile is not capable for the game because I am playing this game for long time and it's never crashes and I love the story and its character are very amazing and graphics too!! . I also played Genshin impact it was good both of games are very interesting and cool but this time i am supporting honkai star rail.. -""",Positive
"Not only does this app provide different languages and options for players, it includes different servers as well as many more exciting content. This game is probably one of the most unique ones I've come across, and truly is one of my favorites. The game is purely one that is meant for any person. It has enough balance in all aspects where many players would come to love it. Hands down really great game.",Positive
Yes it is a great game even as a person that dislikes turn based games. The character design is amazing and the world depth is nice but for some odd reason it's on ps5 and not ps4 which is a giant reason I've been playing it less than genshin because my phone overheats and dies from it easily.,Negative
"Amazing all-rounded game with spectacular graphics, original storyline that pulls u in completely, well-designed characters each with a unique personality and extremely fun gacha with enough resources given for just the right amount of pulls. Developers constantly develop the game, adding new characters, furthering the storyline and introducing fun and interesting events from time to time. 10/10 would def recommend",Positive
"I thought it was going to be like Genshin (which I eventually gave up maybe five days into installation) however this was definitely not the case. Turn based strategies with a pretty decent storyline so far as well as characters you grow to really enjoy seeing and playing. I didn't expect to love this game as much as I do, I truly do reccomend.",Positive
"after the 1.1 update, the train from the starting menu disappeared. I was still able to log in but the entire map's terrain also disappeared. The game's story mechanics and design were great but its just the technical issues that made this game unplayable",Negative
"Seriously the generousest (if that's a word) of the generous devs in the whole hoyoverse building if I have to vouch for.Treats the fanbase,players and both its male and female characters equally,(actually listens) to what we have to say unlike some other games iykyk üôÑ Story started well,went well,and Penacony deserved an Oscar.Fun Endgame modes that don't leave out the old players. Devs are hilarious with myriads of memes,easter eggs and references-honestly I'm delightful I was day-1 player.",Positive
I love everything about this game. It can make me feel excited and emotional at the same time. Beautiful story telling with beautifully designed characters. The gameplay is fun and very easy to understand but also requires you to strategize your next step which adds up to the enjoyment of the game. I really love this game.,Positive
One of your open world game destroyed my harddrive so for me to continue to play that game I install it in my mobile even thou I need to play it in low graphics setting and as for this one I wanted to reinstall it in my phone but what it said not compatible to my device? How come back then I can install it üòû the game it self is good ah what a let down.,Negative
It got boring quickly and it's really laggy. The background and even the world itself keeps flickering and I couldn't bother to continue to play after level 20 since it got a bit difficult to get levels. To get a character you want you have to get a lot of the currency which is quite frankly impossible unless you pay for it or play the game for a really really long time and just don't spend any currency you previously had.,Negative
"I love the art in this game, very alike to the actual anime. It's so fun and addicting with so many different things to do even after weeks of playing. The devs are very engaging with the community and often do giveaways. Overall, a good experience.",Positive
"I really enjoyed the game, however Star Rail has the exact same problem as all of its games. After a while everything is just the same over and over making it boring. I really love the mechanics of the game but when i have to fight once every 100 chat logs that you cant even skip, it gets very frustrating and boring.",Negative
"I didn't even get the chance to play the actual game! It takes 10-15 mins to load and then says ""something went wrong"" and it restarts the whole loading page. DONT DOWNLOAD ITS A WASTE OF TIME!",Negative
"awesome graphic and story, but during the cutscene my frame rate will drop drastically, that's annoying. But when running in open world and battling the enemy the frame rate its stable.",Positive
When I play this game for the very first time it's always glitching a bit a was going a bit further to silver wolf when I went in the phone to see a red dot I went in and then any I get out of the game I use an Google pixel 8 can the editor explain it to what's wrong with the game when I playing on my Google pixel 8.,Negative
"Great game, story keeps me going and gacha is in my blood. I've been playing since launch and never faced any problems or bugs (running on snapdragon 870) everyone complaining are either facing skill issues or don't know wat gacha means. Regarding power creep well duh every game will do that not only this one and the game is very generous we can get around 100 pulls a patch so pulling characters ain't that hard",Positive
"This game is great but after penacony arrived, my device starts crashing everytime I tried to log in. I even tried to delete the game and installed it again but it became worse than i expected to be.I wish this kind of bug is fixed.",Negative
"It's was overall fine.. But it tooken up to much of my storage killed my phone when I deleted all my games. But still it wasn't enough, went up to 29 GM when my phone can hold up to 64 GM I can do that but it makes my phone just die from heat. I'm pretty shock that my phone didn't broke..",Negative
"Everything is good, especially when the Penacony came, this game just keeps on getting better. At first, I thought I wouldn't like it because It's a turn-based game. Almost quitting it at first, but, when I gave it a second chance, I became addicted to it. I highly recommend playing Honkai Star rail.",Positive
"Best game I've ever played. The graphics is nice, the story is nice and I really like the characters. This game makes me comeback to it everyday to farm relics and upgrade characters to beat harder content like MoC. I honestly don't get how people rate this 1 star. To people who rates this 1 star because of the bad Rng it's not the games fault your unlucky. I have won and lost a lot of 50/50's but I don't blame the game because I know the rng entirely random. Keep up the work Hoyo",Positive
"Very sucks at memory storage. You tell me to play a simple turn base game with just a basic attack skill, and ultimate but having big data usage + memory for every single patch? Naah, really if this still happend in next patch Im done with this game.",Negative
"If you enjoy playing male characters and having a competitive male character team, this game is not for you. The male characters are only good for DPS, and the few male support characters are immediately powercrept by female characters and dont play as well in endgame as said female characters. Not to mention, the forced relationship dialogue with some of the female characters add nothing to the story and, if anything, ruins the immersion for me as a female player.",Negative
Very great game! Though takes too much storage while it only has three areas. Please add a feature to delete past quest resources or compress the game files like Genshin. But still a very great games,Positive
"Hello im just dl this game and I download all the resources and when the game has restarted, Im stuck at the loading area I've been waiting for 30mins and it doesnt work so I decided to delete it and dl it again but It just stuck even tho my phone is suitable in genshin but not in Honkai??? Plsss fix this I wanna try this game as soon as possible.",Negative
The game is really fun to play and it isn't really so complicated to figure out how to build characters and you can basically AFK while fighting monsters :D and the story quest line is really enjoying,Positive
"I loved playing this game ever since it came out in April 2023, but recently with the 2.2 update it would bring the game file size to over 65 GB and that would take up over half of my phone's storage, so I had to sadly delete it. I wish the devs could compress downloads to make it more mobile-friendly!",Positive
"Great game but.. They ""introduced a skip button"" for dialogue (except only for side quests) so.. It's a fake skip. KURO MAKE THIS WORK FOR MAIN QUESTS. Our ""decisions"" in dialogue mean nothing so incorporate this to main story missions and I will change my review ty",Negative
"I used to play it more frequently before WW dropped but since it did I ended up with it being an abandoned app on my device. I had my reasons behind it such as I found the combat boring to me, the character designs just didnt MAKE me want them most times, and that it just didnt have as much open world as I'd hoped before. Maybe one day I'll return but till then, farewell HSR",Positive
"Why is it so hard to even get and collect 4 star light cone and character? The game treasures them as if they are limited 5 star. In addition, limited 5 star is difficult to get which I don't mind, but 4 star should be at least easily obtainable and max out as they are being handicapped, this game makes me feel like a handicapped person, the developer gives you a character that is being handicapped intentionally and ask you to pay so that you can enough chance to cure the handicapness.",Negative
"Absolutely amazing graphics, equally amazing characters... but be prepared for this to likely be the only app you have downloaded as it takes up quite a bit of memory",Positive
"I couldn't even get pass the loading screen because some pop up will appear (""Log in failed"") and I couldn't play it. I wanted to play the game longer but I guess the game had other plans. üòÄ",Negative
"It's really good but they managed to make the gear grind every bit as frustrating as genshin. As such, I end up having to take extended breaks(like weeks) from playing the game for my sanity. Please let us reroll sub stats, for the love of god",Positive
"It's a great game and 10/10 recommend it. But personally, I've hit a point where my potato phone can't handle the storage, and I've deleted and re-downloaded this game, as well as delete my other games, but I still very much recommend the game. It's awesome.",Positive
"Boring and lame. The gacha system is good, tho. The story, music, is not really to be called top-notch. The story is pretty much like fairytale. Perfect game for people who are busy. The art is boring, with no diversity. You get lack melanin chars. Everyone is all handsome and beautiful, with window-chests and pale skin. Good at fanserv, tho. Their personality is not well-developed either. Repeat design, much like copy and paste. I wonder if they only hire 1 artist to do EVERYONE design or not.",Negative
"I've been playing the game for around 7 months now and honestly, it's really good! They give us a free 10 pull when you first play, give you 30 pulls for the anniversary, and a free Ratio a few months ago that was limited. I highly recommend. Genshin could NEVER.",Positive
this game is very enjoyable and fun to play but the only thing that i dont like is the big storage space needed for this to be able to be played in my device. i miss playing hsr but i sadly can't play it because i dont have enough storage space for it ;-; ..,Negative
"it was all fun and games until the latest update,2.3,it was too big for my phone,i can no longer play it,my phone only has 128gb,but as soon as i get a better phone with bigger storage,i'll play it again,or until i get a pc or a gaming laptop,or a console,overall,it was a fun game when i could play it",Positive
This game wouldn't have survived if it wasn't a hoyo game. There's no justifiable means for the power creep this game has like pvp. The devs need to take a note from the other turned based games and give ways to bring characters up to the power level to be usable in new content that isn't making a new meta. Topaz and Ratio was brought back because of 2 new characters running back to back that catered to them. There is also a lack of 4 stars making it less desirable to pull from having them maxed,Negative
I've been trying to download this game for months and it always doesn't load but finally after some time it loads and I can play but crashes after five minutes. Disappointed and sad.,Negative
"Awesome! Best Game from hoyoverse. MC has a unique personality, get stronger and very usable with time unlike genshin. The side characters are great. No need to spend money if you want, but you will need to saved up your pulls. Game is also generous with premium currency.",Positive
"It's a very great game the stories are so interesting.And the characters are also very in detail. But the problem is where when cut scenes are displaying it either lags so much or exits from the app I'm not sure it's only on my phone, but few of my friends are also going through this.But other than that everything is great.",Positive
"Don't get me wrong, the art is amazing, the dialogue is interesting, and the pulling experience is not bad. But what I'm here for isn't that. It's the difficulty. The game is TOO HARD. I built the characters and spent a lot of time trying to farm for the materials, but I can't seem to advance in the story. What is the point of good cutscenes and stories if I can't see them. It makes it seem like the only way to play this game is to spend money. I can't deal with that.",Negative
"Game is absolutely amazing. Gameplay, graphics and the story are great. I personally could recommend this game to almost anyone. If you're wondering if the game is worth that space, it's definitely is. Game doesn't have the best fps on my phone so I play it on PC. So if you don't have a REALLY good mobile device I recommend playing it on PC because you won't be able to enjoy the game to the fullest.",Positive
"Absolutely love this game, i love the characters, the combat, the design of the areas and the simulated universe. Only thing i dont like is that if you go free to play you need save up and skip like 3 or 4 banners if you want to garantee to get a new 5 star character.. other then that ive got no complaints",Positive
"I played a lot of games lately and this gave me nostalgia because i grew up on turned based games like FFVII. It was very good for me, i placed a couple of money just to acknowledge this game. This game got good graphics, great story, great characters, good gameplay and great cut scenes. The only downfall for me is the harsh resources to upgrade your characters, but overall it is a great game. kudos to the developers and hopefully all the people contributed to make this game is well paid.",Positive
"it got the best storyline ever so far in the game I've play, even the characters design are pretty cool",Positive
"Somewhat Perfect , but it really helps to fill the void of persona 5 Royal , I mean the charachters , and all the intricate details make this game one of the best strategy turn based games out there and the fact that you can't just rely on a strong charachter to win but you have to think before pressing this command makes the game even more enjoyable",Positive
"A great storyline + has amazing graphics, but one major issue is when I turn them up my screen goes white. It's odd but I can manage with the lowest setting. Idk if this is a glitch or not either. Other than that, I see this as a decent 4/5 star game, I may update it but who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Positive
Completely incompetent account system and customer service has made me give up trying with this game. Really glad I never actually spent money on this game because it would have been a complete waste. Their customer service is also quite rude. This is my second time trying to correct the same account issue. This game is not worth that much grief.,Negative
This game is really good but there are bugs here and there. The loading screen for example is a mess. It's been months since the games launch but the developers are hesitant to fix that. The touchscreen sensitivity should be fixed. I hope you guys fix the game. Cheers!,Negative
I love it. Hoyo is always trying to improve the game and they frequently ask for feedback. What's important is that this game is fun. That's why it's a 5 star for me,Positive
"I see Seele, Instant 5 star for me (‚Ä¢ ‚ñΩ ‚Ä¢), the gameplay are turn based rpg, remind me when i played Final fantasy, i like the design from each character especially the 5 star but the 4 star characters design are also good, i would recommend you to play it if you like turn based strategy, the story so far is as good as the character design. So keep up the good work, I'm waiting for future content, thank you.",Positive
"Game itself is actually really impressive but when i tried one of the so called ""trials"" and used an ability my phone froze. I couldt turn it off leave the game or do anything i had to hold the power button for it to work honestly its the only issue that ive seen so far but it affects alot please fix this soon and it will be a definitely 5 star",Negative
"I downloaded this game hoping it would be immersive, enjoyable, and entertaining. After playing for many hours I can confidently say that I love this game. I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt like the turn-based combat style but this game does it so well! I think the characters are so fun and lively and the imagery is breathtaking. If you love great music, art, story, or characters, this game might just be the perfect download for you!.",Positive
"I wasn't hyped for this game because it's turn based but, it's genuinely fun. Dialogue needs work though. It doesn't sound natural like it does on Genshin Impact and sounds forced. VA in english sounds like they had them say single words for some the dialogue and reused it. Gameplay is solid and plays a lot like Xenosaga with its boost system. Lots of asset flip from their other games but, lore and atmosphere is great. Give it a go and don't be deterred by the review bombs. I'm F2P, too frugal.",Positive
"It's the great game with beautiful graphic and character. The battle system's not too hard, so i can enjoy the story very well. Both main quest and sub quest are really good, fun to play. The two comrade you gave us since the begining is really helpful for newbie. Really great game, i love it and not regret to paid for.",Positive
"This game is honestly just so beautiful. The character designs, the animations, the scenery is amazing! I wasn't sure if I would like the turn based combat style becuase im used to genshins open world combat, but I love it!! I definitely recommend this for genshin impact players who are far in the game and need something new",Positive
"Its a fun game don't get me wrong, however they really need to implement either increased rates or decrease AP cost for certain materials/ exp items on certain days of the week, and not just once in a blue moon. Because honestly speaking, grinding for upgrade materials and exp in HSR is overly tedious and takes too long even for just 1 character... And if you say ""oh we got aether fuel"" that just gives you back 60AP not even full AP....",Negative
The game is very interesting but it consumes a lot of data when playing pls fix this then I'll change to five star,Negative
"This is a stylistic turn-based RPG with a realistic and well written storyline. There are plenty of side games that will keep players engaged and you may even learn some life lessons along the way. It's definitely playable without having to spend a single dime, but you'll eventually get there to support the game and keep up with the content.",Positive
It's really nice the graphics are certainly pretty and the story is really interesting playstyle is very nice different from genshin impact but the only problem is I'm trying to join and it says error 1001_3 and then i can't join in its been 5 days since I haven't been able to join it. I wanna play not be stuck in a sick hole waiting to never play again please fix it so I can once again enjoy something this beautiful,Negative
Would be a great game it has a lot of good things like character designs and graphics even if your using a phone but it doesn't even allow me to log in after one or three days of not playing right after I download it I just thought it would be fix in few days and I didn't mind it because it was just recently released but I been waiting for few weeks and nothing changed I was really excited to play this game but I got disappointed with the errors so I'm hoping HoYo verse could fix the issue soon,Negative
"Good visuals, smooth gameplay. However, I would prefer if there was a coop function added into the game, similar to other games such as Genshin Impact. I believe that would make the friends list more useful and viable. Thank you",Positive
"Very overtheworld storyline, using mythology, technology & anime plot(doraemon) to come out on it. Feels like I'm playing back genre from FF series, which is my favourite. Although rate for drawing 5 star unit wasn't really friendly, but 4 star unit aren't bad themselves to use for long run. Downside is the 90draw guaranteed 5star for event draw, which doesn't indicate the number of draws done if no 5star is drawn.",Positive
"The game is really good on my side though there are a few hiccups along the way like crashing even on the lowest settings but the game is overall smooth might need more optimization for my phone spec is Xiaomi 11 lite 5g Sd 778g 6gb+2gb 128gb. It would also be great if we can have an option to skip the animations for the special attacks, it's kinda tiring to watch after a while",Positive
"Exceptional and Without Equal This game is gatcha, sure. But it is criminal is this rated at a very mid 4.3. The production values from music to cutscenes to story to funny little interactions, voice acting quality, etc. are unmatched. I've tried the competition. FE Heroes insulted my intelligence with part 1's story and the maps were kinda boring. A bunch of waifu trash traps had no difficulty. FGO is bland. This game rocks, hard but doesn't require optimal units, funny dialogue, just good",Positive
"Pretty solid game, combat experience is new with turn-based system, compared to Genshin's RPG-style and Honkai 3rd's fast-paced combat, and being able to manipulate combat turns w/ character ultimates and certain factors in game modes. Character designs are pretty cool and detailed as well, but one issue for me is, the game crashes or freeze often during combat or attempting to log in, but the whole experience is refreshing and new.",Positive
"Combat and exploration is really fun without being time consuming or stressful, you can even idle the combat if you want. The gacha system is a lot more fair than most games and has generous rewards, the graphics and character designs are gorgeous, and the story has been interesting so far.",Positive
"Not as remarkable as Genshin Impact or even Honkai Impact 3rd, Honkai: Star Rail can be a good game, with nice graphics, amazing character designs and interesting maps. The only letdown is the turn-based battle system, reminiscent from classic JRPGs. There are already tons of turn-based games available for mobile, which makes Honkai: Star Rail less unique and original. Genshin Impact has raised the bar when it comes to mobile gaming and Honkai: Star Rail can't keep up with its older brother.",Negative
"Con: was not giving what I was owed, I did 50 draws expecting to get a 5star after the event said 1 was garunteed after 50 draws. Now I'm concerned to spend more money especially when I save my money spent gems or whatever their called until an event I like comes along. Pros: the game is really fun I really am picky when it comes to turn based games I generally don't like them but, this was worth it especially when my friends play it too. I love the game modes somehow they get me to play",Negative
"A fantastic mobile game! A fascinating gaming experience produced by the exquisite attention to detail and gorgeous visuals. The varied ensemble of characters, each possessing unique abilities, enhances the strategic gameplay. Players are drawn into a complex narrative by the captivating plot and excellent voice acting. It is a must-play for fans of mobile gaming because of its dynamic and constantly-evolving gaming environment, enhanced with collaborative efforts of the devs and community.",Positive
"I loved playing this game! It's been over a month since I started playing this game. I truly regret not starting this game before... Grinding is not too tedious, and the storyline is just captivating! Character design is awesome and good lord I'm simping every single character. So far i wasn't that lucky in warping for characters but there is also fun in that... Overall I'm having a good experience üòå",Positive
"Graphics are superb, battle mechanism is fun, storyline is also unique, for all that I would have give it 5 star if it were not for the unskippable dialogues. I only play this game to soothe my bore by doing the turn based battle, yet i must wait few seconds for each dialogue? Absolutely terrible. I felt the same way about genshin too with its unskippable dialogue.",Negative
man I love the game but I just recently tuned the graphics settings and the background in the game are all. white I know the game is farelly new and there will be little bugs here and there so please make sure in the next update could fix the issue with the graphic settings and background but without a doubt this game is freaking awesome üòé keep up the good work 5star all around,Positive
"I really love this game, but version 1.1 is a mess... the lag and constant freezes in combat make the game unplayable no matter the settings. All was perfect before 1.1. I don't have a gaming phone, but i would say that an S22 Ultra is enough. Or it was, in 1.0",Negative
"In recent update, I kept getting blank screen when I switch back to game. I had to pause and received call or adjust phone settings but when I returned the game was blank and then crash. Luckily I could resume simulated universe from when it crashed.",Positive
"(PC ) Don't get why people are so sad about turn-based combat. After Genshin, HSR's gameplay feels refreshing and calmer. Genuinely like the Auto button, cause it lets you grind faster and do something else in parallel. Personally, don't log in everyday and without much effort claimed all BP rewards. And leveled all characters needed (7+?) without any troubles. Energy system is fine to me. However, world exploration feel little blank to new ppl like me. Would like to jump, glide or cravl..üö∑",Positive
HSR has been a rewarding game for beginners. However things get repeatitive in the long run I'm at Trail blaze level 60 and most of my characters are well built. I have nothing more to do then wait for the next patch. After coming from genshin this game is better rewarding for your hard work but it his hard to save resources and you have have to a good resources management. I would say it's a fun game to play when you are off genshin. It's story is quite fun hands down to hoyoüëç,Positive
I usually don't review apps. However I absolutely love this game I have been playing it for a few days now and the story is excellently done. The bottle system is fun. And there is minimal IG purchasing. I haven't needed to purchase anything to enjoy the game. Well done Devs. The only addition I would like to see is maybe controller support. I play it on my Tablet and my phone and controller support would be next level.,Positive
"I like the generous reward when you do task or play battles, so I find this easy.",Positive
"... lovely-game. All the superlatives you would expect are here: amazing characters, great-story... and phenomenal game-engine. The one thing most aren't expecting, however, is the diverse turn-based strategic-element mixed with just enough open-world exploration and real-time action to scratch everybody's gaming-style itch. This has the legs to overtake Genshin as the perfect mobile-experience.",Positive
Controls: Fantastic Graphics: Exemplary Cast of characters: Astonishing Story: Out of this world An absolute pleasure to play this game. The story is utterly captivating and even the little side missions draw you in. The characters' abilities are varied and have awesome effects to them. It is well worth playing through Great job Hoyo,Positive
"Great game, when i saw the gameplay on yt i was quite disappointed with it but i still gave it try and now I'm level 56 just overall enjoying the game. I like the limited areas to run around cause you don't need to explore much to get the region's currency and get the rewards compared to genshin but this limits gameplay aswell but overall i love it",Positive
This game might be fun if I could actually install it without it crashing every five minutes,Negative
"It's ok I guess. Kinda hoping there were more skills per character instead of just normals, skill, and ult. It feels like genshin but turn-based and you can't dodge and no open world. But it's pretty fun despite all that. It's also a bit more expensive than genshin with the monthly sub. Aside from those issues, I really like the lip sync in this game. All of the 4 language dubs got really good lip sync. Story is ok and funny. Dailies are fast too. Perfect side game to Genshin.",Positive
"The only issues I have is during cutscenes. Unfortunately, it's not video-rendered like Genshin Impact, but more of actual rendered. And it demands a higher graphics option, which makes my phone stutter and lags during cutscenes. Hope you'll optimize this in the future.",Positive
"From what I've been able to play, the game has potential. It seems fun, and I love the turn based combat. What I don't like is the fact that it's Hellishly unoptimised texturally for phones. When I want to play a game, I want to see textures, not a whole load of pink on the screen. Fix that, and id happily increase my score",Negative
"Controller support is completely broken playing with my ps5 controller. The on-screen prompts keep switching between the ps buttons and pc, and the controls are just broken. The O, X and etc. buttons are switched around no matter how I try to fix it in the settings. Most other buttons are non responsive, and when I try to use the on-screen buttons, some don't work either like the phone one it makes my character attack.",Negative
"Game is good, from story, v.a, ost, and character design 9/10 rating Every update gives us new maps, characters and content ps - i hope they can continue this troupe unlike genshin where we keep on getting character re runs for no absolute reason I think the common issue rn is some compatability with other devices(mobiles) that often shows some glitches in graphics and error",Positive
"I've got to say that I love the game, great quality, fun, and not overly complicated. As well as what I find to be the best about the game is despite having gone through the first part of the game i can still uptain a lot of items and complete thing's without feeling like I have to purchase something, as more mobile games now do. This is definitely my new favorite!",Positive
Better than genshin. In here you can grind faster and it also has better quality the character designs are seriously amazing,Positive
"It's Genshin but sci-fi, a bit less open-world, no coop, and better battle system. Same gacha mechanics and Stellar Jades are literally rebranded primogems. Story's good so far. I like it a lot. I told myself Genshin would stay my favorite but I'm beginning to realize that that may no longer be the case. Also!! Can be played and enjoyed without playing any of the other Honkai games. I haven't played any of the others and it's still a good time.",Positive
"Crashes. Everytime I tap to start button, it kepts saying ""There has been a problem."" And sends me back to tap the start button again. Would have been fine right? No. It always happens. Heck, even when I first started playing, I had to submit a ticket :(((",Negative
Honest ads unlike other game that just copy paste other ads and even though it's a turn based gacha game it has deep story and even have animated video and you have idol star now,Positive
"HSR is one of the best Turn-Based Gachas out right now imo, with a plethora of content especially for new players and various game modes that utilize your characters in many different ways. The devs are very generous with jades (the currency used to pull new characters) and introduce QoL every major update. I have played since launch and I've even spent money here and there, but you DO NOT have to.",Positive
The enjoyment of the turn based combat comes from turn order manipulation to increase attacks you do while delaying enemy attacks. This adds some thought to when to use ultimate which can be triggered at anytime breaking turn order sequence. The story is decent and fun. Characters are pretty standard design wise. Animations are nice and voice or music is good too. Grind is pretty harsh for optimal gear but there is plenty of enjoyment before that. Gacha is rng as per usual...,Positive
"Game is good, with enjoyable story, characters and combat(if you like turn based combat). I'm only giving the mobile version a bad review because you implemented gamepad use on the PC and PS version, but somehow decided to not have it on mobile. Why? I hate playing using a touchscreen, so I was looking forward to playing it on the go with my controller attachment, but no, it doesn't work... I'll edit my review to a better score if you decide to implement controller support on mobile.",Negative
"Ever since the release of that game, I really enjoyed it (everything smooth yet still not) After the new update..I can't play it much longer and hard to login. Everything get laggy and glitchy right now. I hope devs can fix this minor bug like 1-3 days after the new version (I don't want to miss the new event) Pls hoyoverse fix this as soon as possible",Negative
"Hello i really enjoying this game, just i got one problem after v1.1 release there's some bug that always make me cannot log in like lag's texture transparent and error 1001_3 it's always bother me and sometimes I can't get into the game, even if I can get in there are still problems like excessive lag, texture bug And there are many more, and if possible, please fix the excessive bug and lag as soon as possible",Negative
"I was really into this game for a couple months. Unfortunately the content updates are very slow and mostly just relegated to new characters and not actual gameplay. It has since been uninstalled, but might be worth checking out again down the line once it has more to it.",Negative
"Only getting 2‚òÖ as of yet because yes, it's a decent game, but it bugs out sometimes, and crashes from time to time, my phone is more than powerful enough to play it, I've been playing it for the past 2 days and only have a problem every once in a while, but still, it's kind of annoying when I first start up the game, get in and tap on 2 things, it starts loading and then crashes. It's just not something that should be happening after this long after release, tbh.",Negative
"When I heard about Honkai: Star Rail I thought back to my negative Genshin experience, but in the end decided to give it a try anyway since it was said Genshin's mistakes were for a part fixed. Gotta say: this game delivers big time. Exploration ‚úÖ Engaging story ‚úÖ Interesting strong starter characters ‚úÖ Free to play ‚úÖ Different kinds of (small) puzzles ‚úÖ Turn based and real time gameplay ‚úÖ Playing for 6 days now and still engaged in the content. Nothing is yet blocked with a pay wall.",Positive
"More generous and rewarding experience than GI. I play both HSR and GI as well as their respective type of gameplay, but this one is more compelling to play than the other despite its simpler mechanics (turn based and can even auto play). Character development and story are also great with the MC being an MC that actually matters both in story and in gameplay.",Positive
"Very, very good. My only critique is very personal and is not a reflection of the game being bad. There is a lot of dialogue and I wish I could skip it faster. I dont care much for side quest stories and prefer the combat over character dialogue.",Positive
"The game was fun and all until the 1.1 update, What happened to the textures? No floors, no walls, only the characters. I can't play properly anymore. It takes too long to login. I restarted, reinstalled, but there was no change. I guess it was fun while it lasted.",Negative
"Great game so far, story is interesting and the characters are really cool. Glad main character isn't absolute garbage like genshin, but isn't too strong either. They will obviously be power crept by new 5* characters so maybe I'm wrong in the future. Glad there is auto sometimes because grinding materials is very repetitive.. 8.5/10 because you can't do co-op or chat with your friends, all you can do is let them use your characters or use theirs. So I hope there will be coop update someday.",Positive
The game is fun! Love the characters the graphics are still amazing even everything is so low but I don't really like the constant lags and kicking me out at the game or freezing at random times but I still like it tho :)) hope they fix the constant lags on lower devices ^^ but overall the game is fun to play.,Positive
"Just jump in. Hard to explain,but good. U won't regret it. Thought I had to rush thru worlds & never see it again. But the attention to details in every tiny thing is immaculate. I find myself wanting to explore & NPC's are actually interesting as if they were real people with lives & meaning instead of one & done bye. Great community too.",Positive
"well i played it for a few days, months and months ago and it was very nice. its not like genshin impact fyi. battle is different, its more futuristic but its pretty cool after all. just i wanted to play it again, waited ages for the resources to download and when it got to patch update it just kicked me out and stopped responding. i really like this game, i do but im not sure what to do.",Positive
"To begin with there are a lot of problems on the game. Firstly, it keeps on crashing I have to open the app alotta times and restart my Device so it wont crush secondly the game won't let me in it keeps on saying log in problem but there was once I got to play it but it keeps on bagging, crashing, and lagging. I really want you to fix it pls I can't stand people on TikTok enjoying it while I exausted my self waiting for months but just ended up not playing it pls fix it I wanna play it so badly.",Negative
"Everything is good like character designs, story telling, cutscene and interface and very interesting to play doesn't feel like boring you can play for whole day if you want only one thing that I didn't like was there was no chat option to chat with friends which was very disappointing like then what was the need of friend list.I hope that hoyoverse will see to this issue and fix it in upcoming updates.",Positive
"Didn't expect to love playing a turn-based game so much.. really like the story and gameplay. I like that this game offers better system, is not limited and has humor in it. Would be better to add a swap relic option so players can easily optimize build when they need use another element.",Positive
"The best game I've played, well sometimes I do get some trouble logging into the game cause it takes like a while for me to enter. But other than that one issue, the game is super fun and playable maybe because my phone was the problem and not the game. Haha! Anyways the game is fun, I love all the characters and the story is entertaining.",Positive
"This game is unplayable. Login error keeps on popping up. EDIT: It's playable now! (my device is a low-end one btw) However, there are times when the game crashes, especially whenever I try to use the sensor in the hidden trotter quest.",Negative
"I LOVE THIS GAME. the gameplay is smooth the storyline is AMAZING the scenery is GORGEOUS the character designes and lores are AMAZING and it's overall just a game i get LOST in, i truly js love it so much. Id complain about something, but i really cant think of anything at all! AMAZING GAME!! And one of the best parts cuz im broke, is how it doesnt take 100 years to collect in game currencies like stellarjade and gacha tickets, which usually id spend LOADS of money on, and there are NO ADS. ‚ù§ü§å",Positive
"Feels like a million of the jrpgs out there I've tried while waiting for this to come out. Like a downgraded genshin. Since it's not so open-worlded, the game feels very linear. Especially since I want to be more invested in the gameplay than the unskippable story/cutscenes. Might give it to lvl 20 (lvl15 now) but I am bored! ...even as a fire emblem/persona/final fantasy turn-based fan.",Negative
Overall this is super fun to play I love the character designs and the sceneries is also very good and it has a unique touch on it an open world with a unique battle experience as a turn based game this is absolutely good not only that it also has a very very interesting story like and characters story that u can interact I can't wait to see new maps to be added and also characters because every update is just keeps getting better and better I hope they keep it up also it's a very f2p friendly.,Positive
Hello hsr developers I've been having an issue since 1.1 released and that's why I've deleted the game ever since I've been trying to download all the data the screen becomes laggy when I tried to play my phone was at it's worst conditions and suddenly became more laggy and my phone was heating up and suddenly the screen became black and I had a hard time getting out from the game I didn't have this issue when the game released in 1.0 and so I hope u can fix this issue in 1.2,Negative
"the game itself is good, I really enjoy raising a character, and kinda like the story also, but I can't really enjoy the story because the game starts lagy and stuttering whenever cutscene playing. I hope dev can lookup into this problem. I'll give 5 Stars once it gets fixed.",Negative
I love this game. I love the characters. I love the plot. I really like al designs. And i really like the effort that was put into all the small but important details. I could only recommend this. Its really easy to understand the gameplay and get into the game. I would also recommend leaving the voices in Japanese. It just sounds better.,Positive
"There a couple of things that need to be worked on. One, when I boot up the game it's very slow and not very responsive. And two it tends to lag quite a bit. And three, even though it is compatible with my phone, the background doesn't load as well as it should, and it keeps flickering. Quite literally. A lot of things in the background when exploring, fighting or even during cutscenes things will just... Flicker. Constantly. It gives me a bit of a headache to be honest.",Positive
"Wonderful RPG with amazing graphics and cool controls. The storyline is amazing and the fighting is superb. I'm rating it only three stars though because I've kind of recently deleted the game, and just redownloaded it. I tried logging in (same account and everything) and it saved none of progress and started me at the beginning. I'm having to start the entire thing again, good thing that before I didn't get very far üòí",Negative
"Nothing really worth noting. Enemies recover from debuff or breaks so fast. Random weakness encounter like you don't know what majority of the enemies weakness are. No skip dialogue option. You can't adjust the party when you are about to fight an enemy. Seriously, make us adjust the party right before the battle starts not make us adjust before hitting the enemy for battle. Right after recovering from break enemies can immediately attack. Update is just like re-installing the game.",Negative
Honestly better than genshin easier to level characters and yourself up love the turn based combat and the free roam included Honestly would give it a 10/10 if I could. The character design and animation as well is exceptional I feel like the more events that get added in time this will be a game immortalised for mobile ‚ù§Ô∏è,Positive
"Immersive, well thought out and executed. Dialogue in story and environment is genuinely funny. Characters and the world is rich in personality. It looks amazing. The turn based system is surprisingly fun. Autoplay keeps it from feeling repetitive during farming and could be run in the background when you're busy.",Positive
"Unfortunately not good.... really wanted to like this as Honkai is a favorite of mine and Genshin is also a lot of fun. However, this has super shallow gameplay for a turn based game (characters only have 1 skill) and the gameplay loop is shallow. The gacha is honestly the worst I've used as well, there is no shortage of lightcones(weapons) you won't be able to use. Only positive I can give it is the art direction and character design, which is solid as always.",Negative
"The game is amazing yes. But there is a problem though, whenever I log in, and press automatic log in, like pressing the Google logo then automatically goes to your account that is already registered. But instead of going on my registered account, it created another account. Its getting kinda annoying",Positive
"This game is good! I like the graphics and animations its look cool! BUT I can't read what they're saying, because there is a glitch, the letters turn into box shaped, I can't read the single things they're saying üòûüò≠.. I tried to uninstall then download it again, but there is still a glitch, it won't disappear, the story look cool, but it sad that i can't read it ‚òπÔ∏è.. Please Fix it! I reallly want to reaaadd the storry plzzz ü•∫üò≠",Positive
"I genuinely like it, I personally love turn based battles, I have quite alot of experience with it the ultimates animations are beautiful..! as someone who came from genshin...üòî I like the diffrence I love how diffrent they are bc I would probably get bored of it fast. it I like it, the story is good so far I would say but overall from the first release I like it so far no buggies and lags yet so yes 5/5 rnü´µ",Positive
"Been playing since launch and even though sometimes I just log in to do my daily tasks, the story has been amazing, the character designs are beautiful and the soundtrack is fantastic. The team behind Star Rail truly cares and it shows with the effort they put into the game. And they listen to their players.",Positive
"The game needs more content/things to do outside of combat, though that's not easy to make since there is no world exploration. Adding a hub where you can see and chat with other players sound cool, or housing system, I don't know.",Positive
"Oh please it keeps crashing everytime i wish, my phone can handle bothe genshin and honkai impact's pulling animation, I don't know why ut can't handle the wishing animation on this one, tried lowest graphics still crashed. The gameplay is smooth no prob, character lobby no prob, other stuff no problem, it's just the wishing animation that keeps me from playing this game, until this isn't fixed or whatever i won't install it again.",Negative
"Fun game, really like the characters. Storyline is interesting so far. I'm rating this 3 stars mainly because of the absurd amount of crashes there are. After I completed some of the storyline (which had lots of graphics, cutscenes, etc. but barely lagged), the lagging has increased insanely. I can't even fight something without lagging even though I was able to fight a new boss and watch cutscenes pretty smoothly. I'm not sure if this is just me because my phone handled hsr just fine before.",Negative
A great turn based game with stunning visuals. This games characters do collide with honkai impacts characters but thats ok. The events are a little slow and not many come out very often but stellar jade is very easy to farm. Acheivements and missions and story are very easy to farm currency. At the moment I think its doing very well. Only thing is it does heat up devices very quickly and will lag if your device isnt the best. Otherwise its doing very well and would recommend if you know honkai,Positive
"it's good, but please add function to swap relics entirely with other characters, it's tiring to swap it one by one, and also why in auto mode some characters always use skill rather than basic attack? and why in auto mode the characters not always attack to enemy with compatible weakness of the toughness? rather attack enemy with more health? and sometimes use ultimate to enemy with wrong toughness? what is the logic behind it? please fix it or maybe please improve the ai. thx.",Positive
"The story and characters of this game is pretty good. But once the honeymoon phase is over, you will start noticing a big problem with this game. Not only the gacha rate compare to other turn base gacha games are bad, but also the resources it needed to build one character are extremely high. Like once you pull a character, it's gonna take weeks or months of farming just to build ONE character. You will be running out of XP book, light cone XP, credits and etc.",Negative
"Whenever a character uses their ultimate, theres an offchance that the sound keeps playing meanwhile everything else, which for so3em reason INCLUDES THE ENTIRE PHONE, is stuck 15 seconds in the past. Ive had to force stop the app, but then the problem got so bad it spread to the login screen. This isnt an isolated incident, there's other reviews stating that this happened to them also. Please HoyoVerse, patch this.",Negative
"This is a gatcha game, however, the game is an experience worth playing for the story alone. Apart from the story there are elaborate events that keep the game fresh while bigger instalments are being worked on. One of the most ambitious and well done phone games I've ever played.",Positive
"Wonderful game, great cast of voice actors. The combat though simplified, is smooth and graphically beautiful. The puzzles are great.. please add them as dailies! The story is very good so far and the climax to part one and the soundtrack is fantastic.",Positive
"As expected Mihoyo delivered the game without a hicup. I play on both android and pc and the game runs smooth on both. My only complain is that on android some people seem to get error messages while logging in including me. Although it has quick fixes like restarting the game or mobile, or removing adguard from dns, I still hope the problem can be fixed.",Positive
Amazing game. Great music and main story (some side stories are just skippable). Smooth gameplay and less time consuming than genshin. You should expect a slower gameplay once you reached a certain level in the game. For the story continuation also need to wait for the next update to come.,Positive
"Good story, good graphics but boring gameplay. I love rpgs almost finished all the FF series but Honkai urgh... The way combats are fought is basic, the story even thought it's good, it's a real chore to go through. All progress is lock behind the story which cut my enjoyement cause i'm stuck doing quests I don't care about. So I'm level 30 since 4 month now cause I refuse to do the main quest. Progression shouldn't be lock behind campaign it's ridiculous for a free game. Time limited coupons...",Negative
"I've never really played turn based games, this is one of the few times I did and it's great!, better than I expected, The ultimate and skills we're amazingly done with details, but a problem is when I try to log into my laptop using my account It doesn't work even I recheck from my phone and yet it still won't log in..",Positive
"Great characters, fun (if too long as usual from Hoyo) dialogue, great world building. Was staying away from turn based games but this brought me back, love the combat. Predatory gacha (also as usual). Lacking endgame which is still a problem in Genshin so I am not optimistic. But great visuals and relaxed playstyle keep me on it for a while. UPDATE 6/1 - Content did not last long. No real endgame and same stamina gating progress as Genshin, but far worse with no content. Done for now.",Negative
"I love this game! The quality, characters, gameplay are great! But i don't like that it often crashes on the loading screen, like it just gets stuck and I have to re start the game. Though, everything is great overal <3",Positive
"Casual and F2P friendly game, you can get a five star character for free when you progress further in the game. The turn based battle is fun and don't be mislead by other people saying it's not. It also contains handsome and beautiful characters üíû and Good storyline üìñ. You can travel different worlds with their own different stories. If you don't like to grind hard and be casual everyday this game is for you.",Positive
"As a Honkai series fan and turn based gameplay enjoyer, I really like this game, although it is understandable why complete open world isn't possible, still I wish it was possible, for now the main story isn't intense, but the side missions are really good, pity they aren't voiced. I use Chinese voice over, it was good to hear both Genshin and Honkai characters' VAs in this game, also maybe coincidentally, but devs used Genshin feedback in HSR, they really improved the overall system. Lol.",Positive
The best game you will see for a while it has great graphics you can teleport any where you go so if you miss a boss fight or miss a chest you can go back and get it the ultimates are amazing the characters and don't get ne started on the voices They fit some of the characters perfectly and I just can't stop playing the game.GO HOBKAI:STAR RAAAAAIL,Positive
"Hoyoverse doesn't ever let us down. Star Rail is like exploring a parallel universe to Honkai without the Honkai. The characters look great, the Chinese VAs are impeccable as always, and the visuals are excellent. I haven't played any proper turn based RPGs lately, and this is refreshing from what we are used to with Honkai or Genshin. It's got so much familiarity with its links to Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact. Truly, it's like they took both games and made an RPG baby. This is APPROVED.",Positive
"This would be a five star rating but, everytime theres an update the clouds in game start changing color in a very unsettling way, It gets fixed if i redownload the game but at the next update the same problem returns. I dont know if its a problem on my phone or not Im using a samsung A50 and it runs really smoothly, I just wanted to know the reason why its happening",Positive
"Absolutely excited for the release!!! But people have been saying that when you finished the download in-game it crashes or freezes, it did happen to me but all you have to do is reopen it, and this game just came out so I expect that it would have some bugs here and there. it would be an easy fix in the future. I think ü§î",Positive
"Not only does this game deliver top notch quality graphics.. character design and game play... But the dialog and storyline has been fantastic.... I am still early on and not only have I chuckled quite a bit.... But the character development and delivery has been top notch... 1st rpg in a while, where I'm reading the story instead of skipping... Fantastic job! it literally gets me over the fact that there's no pvp....",Positive
"when I log in the game, the train car disappears, and when loading screen, it will stop and force closed. I hope this is fixed, even though there was an error before logging in, I still have a way to login correctly. I hope this gets resolved quickly.",Negative
"The game is nice, but it literally has texture and animation defects/bugs. From the simple action of running where a pink shape appears instead of the character, to Abilities and ultimates which make pink squares appear instead of actual character animations. I would have played it, but it takes away the fun.",Negative
"The gameplay is right up my alley, which I actually usually don't do turn based games bc many are boring but star rail is engaging and action filled (enemies notice you). As a F2P user, having to use all of your stellar jade to level up feels useless (exp materials), tbh cause it can only level up a few levels, but I really want more materials to upgrade but I can't even do that cause I would have to spend money to get more stellar jade to actually level up. Put more quests w/ more stellar jade.",Positive
"Overall, really enjoy the game when there is new content to go through, but my biggest ask would be for controller support. While the touch controls are servicible, being able to use a controller would make the game far more enjoyable.",Positive
"All I can say is that it runs very smoothly for low end devices like mine my phone is about 2 years old and it still runs very smoothly yes there are some bugs for logging in like it say ""error (numbers) login later"" but all I did was close the game and relogin and it worked so as of rn it's good for me 5/5 stars I'm gonna edit this later if I we're to encounter any bugs",Positive
"I would give it a 5 star before, After the silver wolf update the game became unplayable Everytime I Logged in it keeps kicking me me out with the same error 1303 message,After 7 tried it let me into the game but it's REALLY laggy then after 15 or more seconds the game crashes and kicked me out, It's ALWAYS like that Everytime I Log in, My storage space is Big,My wifi is Good and other games like honkai or genshin never acted like this. Please tell me why it's like this?",Negative
"Great game, probably the best one from mihoyo, I love the concept of trailblazing across different planets and also being on a space station, I also love some of the dialog, but when there is dialog happening, some of the characters mouths don't move, but besides that, it's great, and the gacha system is also improved.",Positive
"Ever since launch, i was never able to even play the game. I would end up in the screen for downloading resources and then it would end up crashing after a while even after restoring the app, rendering it completely unplayable.",Negative
Why its combat style is feels like genshin impact tcg card game. LoL. Why can't we freely move and dodge the enemy attack and fight however we want. It feels like game is forcing me to fight . I mean it feels like a default fighting style. Can't move can't do anything if enemy attack. Anyways i think the developer want to just look every character alt and doing dmg effect look cool. Still a tcg combat style for me. I really don't like it.,Negative
I love this game a lot but I cannot run it on my old Redmi 8 phone anymore because the fps drop so much basically making it impossible to play but I can still play it on my newwer phone but it's still annoying that I can't play it on this phone. Either way the story and gameplay are great I would definitely recommend this game if you have a good phone,Positive
Dailies take no time at all and I really appreciate that. I cant spend all my time on the game so being able to get things done quick is very nice. Plus the game itself is cool and very free to play friendly. I also want to add I appreciate many of the quality of life changes coming off genshin. Material collecting and grinding is a breeze. And most of all THANK YOU FOR THE SPEED UP FUNCTION. ‚ù§Ô∏è,Positive
"Stellar game, pun aside. Beautifully presented environments. Unique and detailed characters. Turn-based battles with well-orchestrated, quality animations that add to the genre rather than Xeroxes of past games. Grinding has a fast-forward feature. A very fun game.",Positive
"The 'Break' effect is really really great, but playing this felt like a chore... Especially that we need every element to 'Break' the enemies so we need to level more character and with some bad luck, you might not be able to break their element because of gacha barely pulling character (10 pull for at least 1) and I meant ANY character, not the highest star character, happened to me (bunch of dupes), surely happened to others as well",Negative
"Its a great game for various reason, the story is intruiging, the characters are great design and lore wise, and the graphics are fantastic. Major problem is the sotrage as it takes a lot of Gb to download/update and causes problems.",Positive
"Except for the combat and story it is an exact clone/reskin of Genshin Impact. Same mechanics menu, items just with different names/icons and same gatcha system. Generally I enjoy the game, more than Genshin. It has nice graphics, good voice acting, enjoyably gameplay and generally it's a well made AAA anime rpg at it's core. The reasons I give it 3 stars instead of 5 it is because of the bad gatcha system and because it's to grindy with timegates and pay to progress walls.",Negative
"(No Spoilers) The plot goes deep. You can get a vague idea of it from YT. There's trailers that have beautiful visuals like in the game. You can explore areas and kill monsters. Like Genshin Impact, you can pull characters. The game is just genuinely fun, you should play.",Positive
"It's the most fun game that I've played in a very long time. There is lots to do, many treasures to find, and many enemies to battle. In battle you can pick which enemy to attack and which skill you want to attack with. Best of all no guilds/alliances/clans. I had to change my star rating because they stopped making worlds to explore. They only created 3. It doesn't take long to get through all 3. Now, all they provide are boring events. It was fun to begin with but dropped the ball quickly.",Negative
It is good but when sometime the scene it..the clock puzzle where it do a scene it appear a train that contain a chest on it..after the train arrive immediately the scene freeze...like it didn't show the train it only show a box and other stuff i couldn't see the train or a chest..i know this game is still new but i hope u could fix this to prevent wasting time need to log out and log in back in the game..here is a 4star,Positive
"I love turn base combat and of course it brought me back to nostalgia of my days playing Final Fantasy 8 and Lost Odyssey(one of my favorite games). Story, lore, combat! Fabulous character designs too! (Admittedly I like Sampo, Welt, and course Jing Yuan's character+design most <3). I can't wait for further installments and defs recommend if you don't mind gacha games <3 OH and Good luck to everyone pulling for Blade ;D",Positive
Its a great game. But the resources are very scarce. The grinding is alleviated by auto battle so it is better than genshin's domains. The relics tho are still a time sink with no guarantee of progress. I hate the system.,Positive
"A must have experience if your a mobile gamer. Immersive story, engaging turn-based gameplay and an open world exploration that looks great to the eyes. As a gacha type game, it is pretty generous compared to similar games. I'll probably refine this review later to give better expectations but I'm going to wait a little longer for that. (Also just as a note, this game is pretty intensive, so depending on the phone you have, your gaming experience may vary)",Positive
I just completed the entire story and every side quest for 1.0 and man this is such a cool and out of the ordinary game. Rarely come across games with interesting and well-made stories anymore that also are super fun and addictive but you can tell they put so much care and their whole hearts into this one along with making each aeon and boss. Lots to do and lots to interact with :) This is definitley a game to try out at least once even if you dont prefer or enjoy these types of games.,Positive
"The game was great and all but it became unplayable with the recent update. Half of the train in the starting menu went missing, along with most lf the games assets. Its like playing an invisible maze when I try to explore the main world. I'm uninstalling the game for now, I hope it gets fixed next patch.",Positive
"Genshin Impact was always too popular for me and also too far-fetched. I know this games has its popularity too but way less than the other one. It was also very old already when I knew about it. Starrail is a game I started since it got officially aired. I'm glad to be part of the journey and I continue to be. It's a fantastic game and even though it's luck based, you can be very strong without spending any money. Some 4 stat chars are very good after all. Almost op.",Positive
The story is enjoyable.Exploring the world it offers is fun.The character's design are fantastic.The music is great.Been having fun so far. Why 4 star?The big bosses(from Echo of War) has some attack targeting issues(it can go behind the ultimate button of characters) and it is laggy.Please fix it.,Positive
"Just wow. I thought it was great. It's awesome. Game crashes whenever you're doing anything. Frame rate falls apart. Gameplay is so bad that the tutorial is too op. You get a level 8 trial character and you're forced to use your exp item on a level 1 garbage unit you won't even keep. Because this is balance. This is how things work. Story is a C, gameplay D. Bugs and glitches. A. There's so many. My characters literally change targets as I tap the target. Fix your isht or don't make anything.",Negative
"This game has the potential to be fantastic. It's a turn-based rpg with beautiful animations and a simple yet fun combat system. The story is solid, and the characters are great. Now, I don't understand why I am not allowed to play the game once I catch up. I literally cannot grind lower tier gear or anything. And the trail blaze energy mechanic gives me about 8minutes of content to do daily. This isn't enough time for me to become remotely invested. Let me play your game.",Negative
"Game is good with a decent storyline and graphics. There is no battle rating or VIP system like in other turn based games. However, it's got terrible drops in gacha. The game gives you a lot of rewards although and you can make a good team without paying. Every version gives 10pulls and enough gems to roll on banners. The open world is very limited to explore but the small amounts of details behind it is good. The combat does get repetitive and boring so there's auto. Overall I recommend.",Positive
"This is a really good game, and I really enjoy it. I liked Genshin Impact too, but I couldn't play it as I don't have enough storage to do so. It's kind of upsetting that Genshin Impact takes up too much space. However, this one is good and doesn't take up an overwhelming amount of space. I hope it doesn't end up becoming big and take up too much space in the future, to the point where I can't play it any longer and be forced to abandon the game.",Positive
Finally I found the best catcher game easy to level up and easy to grinding items keep up the good work from the game Don't put the PVP mode because someone want paid to win from the game I hate that because me I don't like paid to win I don't have a money I just want level up and hard work that is the best game ever and also fix the issue from the graphics I guess if you going medium graphics the graphics fully white and also my internet is very high why try again you need fix that,Positive
"I already tried this game. This game is really amazing. This reminds me of playing the original FF7 and FF10. I really love some turn-based games because I grew up with them. I love the graphics, the english voice acting, and the areas inside the game. I really love how we get to choose our main character (male or female) and it's a 5 star character which is a good thing for me. Anyway, keep up the good work developers. :)",Positive
"I couldnt quite put it into words but this game really is a masterpiece. Ill purchase the battle pass as a token of gratitude to its developers, not because i have to. You can win the game without spending a penny but the gacha characters are so lovely so its worth spending for. I cant wrap my mind around how thoughtful of mihoyo to put in so much detail into lores, side quest, and mini puzzles on the game. You wont get bored doing side missions. love it!!! Please, continue this state of the art",Positive
"improve simulated universe weekly farming, it's only fun the first few times and gets tedious and slow really quick, really discourages to open the game. relic farming is already so awful here, make it lighter. very weak narrative. events are not fun at all. the gameplay is promising, it sucks that overall this game is really bad. and for a mainly visual game, please for the love of everything that is holy, make ACTUALLY good ultimate animations. cmon man, this is really getting annoying.",Negative
"I just want to change the content of my review, to say that this might just be the most fun game that I've ever played of how much content it has to offer and rewards to be received. It's fun to see a game that gives you all you need but somehow still is not enough because of how much characters that I need to build. Maybe because I've played genshin but somehow this game feels way too generous to the players a good lore, with great developers and great character 5 stars deserved",Positive
"It's an amazing game, the graphic is appealing and even tho it's a gacha game the gambling isn't as bad as genshin, although the soundtrack makes me tired and I get bored once in a while when I have no quests and to only grind or is stuck on a quest. I do like how the elements are used in this game and I love the style it is in, very different from genshin. Also bronseele is in this game and I love it ‚ô°",Positive
"Star rail is a turn based combat game with limited instance based interactions. the only saving grace is the visuals, the combat system is far inferior to other turn based combat systems, the discovery sequence are very linear and scripted. there are vast amount of currency with confusion for drawing. such as 160 for a 10x draw? also as the accumulation of different currency becomes diversified to encourage purchases for currency XYZ, thus star rail becomes not f2p friendly at all. 3.5/10",Negative
very good game I like the wait until your time feature not like in genshin where you can just spam buttons until the enemy is dead but the wishing or warping stayed the same but I have nothing against that except for how rare it is to get a 5 Star Character the devs should lower the so called pity for a 5 star. that's why it gets a 4 star rating,Positive
"Fun game, good graphics but took over an hour to download. Tutorial could be more clear. It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to move my avatar. But I was intrigued and having fun until they wanted my thumbprint to change a character. Deleted after that. You don't need my thumbprint!!",Negative
"Been playing for a couple of day and im slowly starting to love this game!! I like the graphics,artstyle,game mechanic..Best turn-based game I have ever play so far,the story is kinda confusing cause i cant really tell what the goal of the mc is...But i still love it tho!! Im looking forward for more updates,I also like how its like a mix of genshin and honkai impact,and that theres some honkai impact characters in the game,nostalgia....",Positive
"Excelent game. Writing is top tier. Never have I played a game where I wanted to interact with EVERY object in my path because of fun little dialogue. Players who play Genshin will find many of the core systems to be very similar but vastly improved in Honkai Star Rail across the board. The combat, while relatively simple, is still fun. Visually, the game is very high quality. This is a welcome addition to Hoyoverse's collection for me! Now... if only we could get that $3 Google Play Coupon.",Positive
"This is the best turn base game. The graphics, the system and character is really good. It's very similar to anime. I really like the character design, details of the map, the enemy and even their ultimate skill have a smooth graphics. It's also easy to play and i really enjoy playing this game.",Positive
"Been playing since launch, you can take the game at your own pace and just slowly build up your units. Which is great for me. Music, story, characters, atmosphere all perfect. Summons are more forgiving, if you miss a unit you have a guaranteed summon for that unit, or you can carry it over. The same applies for the light cone summons. Events are fun, memes are plentiful. I hope the keep this direction and keep improving.",Positive
Highly polished game equivalent to retail release. It's got a really horrible summon rate where my first 10x special pull is worse than each of all 6 times of 10x normal pull. This is the only thing holding me back from spending. Tutorials blend in seamlessly as the story progresses.,Positive
"A great RPG and a great gacha game. Even if you're not someone that does mobile games, I'd highly recommend trying this one out (it's a turn-based RPG so the controls aren't an issue!) Character drop rates are relatively fair with a great amount of earnable paid currency and multiple free characters thru challenges (as of the time of me making this review), a wonderful story and characters, good sense of humor, and one of the funnest roguelike modes I've played in any game, ever. 9.5/10",Positive
"I like how this game is currently being handled, the quality of life is very good, doesn't feel like I need to spend 1hr a day for dailies + I can still do the events that I missed out whenever I have a busy month. Character design is very nice, same goes with graphics, music, and world building.",Positive
"It's amazing. My first F2P game and I started it on PC. Was shocked at how good the mobile port both looks and runs. It's amazes me how they have it looking this crisp on mobile. Love the story (finished all the 1.0 release) and can't wait to see where it goes. The characters are fantastic in the story and side content as well as gameplay. Each character is so unique and the team compositions are so fun and in-depth. Making a team that just vaporizes a boss is so fun, challenging, and rewarding.",Positive
It's good but after 1.1 the lag is ridiculous to the point that makes it impossible to play even if you manage to bypass error 1001_3 which ruins the experience when you want to play the game as it'll crash after sometime as well... Please fix this...,Negative
"The game is boring üò™ log in 10 mins to do daily then log out, nothing to do, rewards for killing the mobs in the map is to tiring and you will feel unrewarded. They released new characters as ""content"" but nothing to use of in the game, you will eventually get bored on simulated universe because of forever grind just to get few relic upgrades... Waiting to refill the stamina and get trash relic will surely make you feel bad too üòÆ‚Äçüí® if you don't want to be Stressed out don'teventry the game",Negative
"Maxed out Bladie :) Bless you Hoyo for this character. I do enjoy this game a lot. I like that I don't have to commit a whole lot of time to it. Once you have some characters built well, farming is EZ with auto battle. The story is a little weak but I enjoy it for what it is. I mostly enjoy the characters tbh. I didn't think I was going to like the turn-based combat, but I found out that I HEAVILY enjoy the turn-based combat in this game.",Positive
"Loving it! This is my new addition. I just started to play this game, and it has me hooked. The characters, the story line is outstanding. I haven't played a game like this since final fantasy. The graphics are awesome for a phone game. No ads are the best part. The only thing I wish that you can do is change the look of the character.",Positive
"Honkai Star Rail is one of the best gacha games I ever played, the combat animation is smooth, cinematic is top tier, and the characters design good as well ( even the main character you play as also has good design ). The combat is also amazing, the gacha is pretty much like genshin. Overall it's a fun ride. I like the train and the space theme.",Positive
So good when I'm not at home on my pc I can play this on my phone n amazing graphics on the phone im in love with this one holding my hand more than genshin impact. So far quarter in and I haven't found a bug yet its such a fun story. Update.. the new update won't let me load in after I press start button... August 30th...,Positive
"I love the honkai universe lore. The combat is quite pleasing for a turn based game with an open world type roaming. Ultimate and character designs are on point, and story is perfectly matching for the environment. I do wish that we could get the Google Play coupon that you can buy with play points. It helps alot.",Positive
"It's a great turned base game with interesting npc / characters and designs. The story line is pretty good also. Overall, I have no complaints Its just not my type of game ( sandbox / open world ) I really did try the game but in the end it wasn't for me Just because my Internet ain't working",Negative
"Great game! Good story and good mechanics, rates and all but my game has zero textures! Can someone tell me how to get my walls and other things back? Even the floor is gone, I can see through everything... Its a great game and I enjoy it a lot. Thats my one problem.",Positive
"The game is ok until I fought the first boss, then it became super lag that I don't even know what Im doing. It just freezes but you can click on the setting but you cannot play the game. My phone runs genshin smoothly esp when the wifi is strong, but this game is not. Soo annoying, already emailed hoyo with SR. If my phone is not compatible with the game then don't let me download it.",Negative
"Game is not optimized. Error everytime you login. I tried to compromised lagged but gameplay is not enjoyable. Disappointed since I've waited for the game then I'm not able to enjoy it. Edit to 4* Game is better optimized, able to see enjoy the game. Only 4* becuase it became to repetitive.",Positive
"This game is great, the story is good, the gameplay is good, and the characters are amazing. Although it is annoying when the main quest is level locked, you can always just do calyx and thour dailys. I recommend that if you like gacha games like genshin impact. Oh, and you need a good bjt of space of yer device",Positive
"if you like honkai3rd this game is actually for you. you can explore whole area and there is amazing characters. but if you like genshin no.. personally i didn't like fighting style. you are just standing there and waiting enemies to hit you until your turn and it's kinda boring. i liked animation, story and characters but not the fighting style. also please add turkish sub and don't make us wait like genshin did to us.",Negative
"I'll post a review when I reach endgame. First and foremost, its turn based, which actually works well. Story mode was exceptional. In mid/late game right now, and there's not a ton to do except dailies and gear. Which wouldn't be bad but they are mind numbing boring.",Positive
Why is there no skip dialogue option the 80% of gameplay is dialogues and they suck and are booring af the quests feel like chores . The character and relic system the stats are the good parts but the grind sucks. All i want to do is get good character and build it i am not at all interested in the conversations and story give a skip dialogue option also the choices don't make any difference in quest results so idk why do they even exist,Negative
"Such an amazing game! I played Genshin Impact but I stopped playing due to it being unnecessarily hard to obtain items needed for upgrading characters and weapons. This game fixed that issue and I love the game style, music, and battle mechanics. I definitely recommend this game to people who are RPG fans!",Positive
"This game is fun to play and generous reward too, nicely design and epic soundtrack. Because this gameplay is turn based and i can play this in casual mode (like JRPG btw), but why this game always lagging (frame rate drop) so much when in weekly boss battle? Please fix this lag for future version so the cutscene after the boss battle doesn't lag anymore",Positive
"amazing graphics doesn't make my phone too hot like other games. FPS steady 60. GPU usage no more than 80%, CPU no more than 30%, ram no more than 12% with 12gb. the hottest my phone got was at startup at 114¬∞F no graphical issues. no random FPS drops. people who say they have this issue most likely have a $50 phone. overall great gameplay, love it.",Positive
"These game is Awesome and Fun to play. New contents, Characters, Story and Graphics is amazing. Sometimes login error is 1001_3 and Some lagging issue. Can you fix this issue. Overall game is Well done. Thank You very much!!!",Positive
"the turn based combat feels so slow and bored me to death even with the stunning visuals, it just felt like it's so slow and takes forever to clear a stage that is why i less than 3 days, i gave up on the game and uninstalled it. this game has great settings, graphics and characters, story is kinda lame tbh. overall, the experience was really bad coz of the combat which ruined overall experience. i don't see myself playing this game again.",Negative
"Nearly Perfect game. The only negetive is there isn't more content but it's already so good. I am AR 60 Genshin player and I feel like it's even better than genshin. Serious and interesting story, rewarding, fun, relaxing. And it runs so good on phone as well. Both PC and mobile version plays perfectly without any issue.",Positive
"Gameplay is really good, you can understand most stuffs so easily but when you play the game without buying things its really hard to get the spotlight 5 stars hero, rewards are mostly not enough to save them for one or even you save them for one its really low rng to get it so let us at least in like 3-4 spotlight hero give increase rate or something.. if you dont mind getting the heroes its really good game",Negative
"I like the game good characters, decent fight mechanics good story especially the funny dialogues XD, but the thing is sometimes when I open the game it doesn't load no matter how much I wait, then I have to use VPN to login and it magically opens then it works fine without the vpn, hope you can fix that Edit: it's fixed now.",Positive
"The game is using abnormally high internet data. It is using upwards of 2-3 gigabytes internet data in just a few hours. And that's with the game being Idle because I fall asleep as soon as I start auto-battle mode. On the other hand, when I play genshin from morning till midnight, it just uses 130 megabytes data! How is this friggin turn based single player game using 30x more internet than a whole open world rpg game WITH multiplayer?!! I will stop playing until this is fixed.",Negative
"It was really good, and it's a pretty fun game! And it's extremely easy to burn through all of the content which is a plus for me and the characters designs along with the 3rd models are all top tier. I love it so much the best part about it is the stimulated universes they're actually so much fun",Positive
"Pros: open world with teleportation lots of characters to choose from auto battle/speedup battle available unless its part of a mission easy to figure out fun story to follow great graphics and runs smoothly Cons: this is a large app, it is the largest app on my phone at 9.89GB not a huge fan of turn-based battles but with auto battle and speedup battle it is not a nuisance not really a team-based/multiplayer game so even though it is an open world you wont see anyone else and thats unfortunate",Positive
"I'm not normally into turn based games I usually find them tedious but I really like this one since we have a speed up option and an Autoplay That I use for grinding its really fun I like the characters and the story I wish the recharge was shorter for the trailblaze power but I got to rank 63 with what we already have so I can't complain to much, all in all this is a really fun game",Positive
First off graphics nice story seems decent but rewards for grinding not worth it. Early in the game and I'm stuck because I can't get enough level ups. Kind of stupid for people trying to just learn the game. Why do we have to watch those same fight animations over and over and over again. Something isn't right with this game it feels so unsatisfying. Plus what's with all the games having this your memory is gone thing? Can't anyone be original. Horrible story telling. I felt lost the whole time,Negative
"Even better than genshin. The combat seems easy at the beginning but gets really hard later on. Lots of text and story, perfect. I don't know why people want to skip through dialogs? It's a story game, learn to read and have a proper attention span or go to tiktok. Gacha seems fair so far, two 5* without spending money and a guaranteed 5* every 100 pulls is sweet. For a mobile game literal perfection.",Positive
So excited when the game released all the characters is amazing and the story feels like a movie I got to say that hoyo did an excellent job for this game! But gonna remind you all that this is a turn based game and not like genshin an open world ü§ß ANY WHO I probably recommend this to the people who want to explore a new experience or new style of fighting. 10/10 for me or 5 star at this point üòå,Positive
"This is a great game, one that I love very much, having played since release. However, every time I try to open it and enter to play, the screen blacks out for a second and the app closes completely. Reboot my phone doesn't seem to fix it, and it's been a while since I was last able to play.",Negative
"It's difficult to control your character with the on-screen directional pad, and this game isn't even compatible with my PS5 controller when I bluetooth connect it to my phone. I've waited so long for the PS5 version only to find out they're charging for it, unlike Hoyoverse's other game (Genshin Impact) being free-to-play. When they are both very similar, have the same type of game mechanics, as well as in game purchases. They're essentially the same game, but with a few slight changes.",Negative
Good game I say had no glitches or bugs while I am playing really is a adventure game and open world but not really like a full open world just like a small open world. So far it is good and I rate it 5 star. I think the glitches and all that is happening depends on you phone or maybe wifi so make sure to have a good phone and wifi to play the best experience,Positive
"(UPDATE 1.0-1.5) This game is as usual amazing, characters and storyline are quite decent for the most part and there isn't much flaws despite a few quests, and etc (for end game players.) However overall and enjoyable experience‚Äì as always, turned based games may become boring for most people however I think this game can be long lasting¬∑ Though it'll be nice if the max trailblazer level would be more than 70. (since I maxed out my trailblazer level.)",Positive
"A mobile game with a shine of quality to it. Near full voice acting (besides your character), interesting character designs and has just the right kind of flashiest to it. It should definitely be in the Top 20, or even better, of the Google Play store.",Positive
"as someone who loves honkai universe and turn based games, I really enjoyed playing this game. There were issues like login failed and cutscene lag so I just hope they'll fix it soon. I like the story so far, the character designs, cast, graphics and music are also topnotch. Can't wait to collect the rest of og honkai characters (‚Å†‚âß‚Å†‚ñΩ‚Å†‚â¶‚Å†)",Positive
Would play it if it wasn't turn based. Loved the combat of genshin. It was simple. But a lot of mechanics like resin drove me away. I Was excited to year about a game similar to genshin that to the sci-fi route and then disappointed by the turn based combat. The idea of just standing there while I let an enemy hit me when i could just move is ridiculous to me.,Negative
"It's fun an all, but I recently faced an issue. I can't seem to download the jp voice resource and kept getting disconnected, and just now I got disconnected suddenly when my WiFi is good.. Even tho I tried to restart it; it still an error, I can't log in.",Negative
"Very good game. I removed 1 star for the fact that after lvl40, its really hard to level up and there is no mission or side missions except the 1 daily. Its kind of grinding and farming after u reach lvl40. And the drop rate of yellow heroes is too low. The only reason i am not playing more and investing more is the energy system. Im done using 300 energy in less than 30min. Done in 15 min if only using the 180 energy.",Positive
"In my opinion, Best (turn-based) Gacha game right now!! I've been playing since release, and I just had to rate it 5-stars now because of how generous I realized they are trying to be. I read the summary for the 1.3 update, they are making a lot of changes to make players' lives easier, and giving away some 4* characters for free. Also, there are lots of events to get passes to use for Gacha.",Positive
"I think after the 1.1 patch, everytime i finish one stage, its just plain black screen. It wont load anymore. Please fix this issue Update: After the recent patches, it was fixed and im happy to enjoy the game once again. Thank you for hearing this out",Positive
"I play a lot of mobile turn based, but this one graphic, game play, and story qualities is on another level, i also play genshin and know how hard to get 5 * in game, for f2p some chara took years to get , but i dont think i will play turn based rpg with the same rng as hard as genshin (as f2p) and start collecting resources little by little all over again for years to come xD , i rather just continue play genshin. Uninstaled .. Lot of turn based rpg game with less quality but satisfying to play",Negative
"Gameplay is fun, storyline is interesting with well designed and loveable characters and the game as a whole looks good with fantastic music, but the best thing for me is that the developers actually value their users feedback and regularly add quality of life updates to improve the game. They also reward us for certain things with actually decent rewards and not some last-minute unhelpful freebies. It's also pretty free to play friendly compared to other gacha games.",Positive
"Gameplay is okay enough, but I am constantly having to reset my password even though I have it saved on my phone. New update? Password don't work. New version? Password don't work. it's been longer than 3 days? Password don't work. Even when I go to do the security things they say I'm failing when I'm doing them in the right order.",Negative
"Still the same unskippable long and boring dialogue that made me quit Genshit. Very long tutorial. I thought the turn-based gameplay is like classic turn-based Rpg e.g. FF,Suikoden,DQ or Chrono series but it's just Genshin but slower same 1 skill 1 burst mechanics, UI, and everything else is all like Genshit it's not all bad and it let me get familiar to the game immediately but I was expecting something fresh or should I say ""not Genshin"". Also Hoyo, you had gotten stingier :(",Negative
Amazing game just I don't know why I lag when I do everything and it lags very badly.i also have some issues when I switch some things in the settings for example : when I change the graphics to low or higher the background turns glowing white . please fix these issues,Positive
Hi this is such a fun turn based RPG game I've been playing ot for weeks and its was really enjoying and thrilling expereince but the most recent problem I've been expereincing lately is the stellar jade issue I've been saving up for quite some time for upcoming characters and had around a thousand stellar but when I opened the gacha shop all of it were gone I don't know if it's a bug or something but I hope you can guys can do something about it because it was really devastating.,Negative
"It's soo laggy! I really want to keep playing it because all my friends are playing it and it seems interesting. But, I just can't. It keeps lagging and the cutscenes drops my fps too much to the point the audio would sound like they're talking in a walkie-talkie, Then game would play smoothly one second then after 30+ minutes it would suddenly freeze, lag, and drop my fps, btw, I play it on OPPO and have the LOWEST graphics/setting set for this as possible but to no avail it still doesn't work.",Negative
"This is one of the best games along with Genshin that Hoyo made. I rlly recommend playing this tho I suggest u to play it with high storage phones like 64GB or 128GB. Everything is so good, the art style, the scenery and so many more. Hope this keeps up especially those attractive looking characters and interesting plots :)))",Positive
"This game will take serious power to play, so only attempt to play this with a proper phone. Else you'll hate the texture corruption, lag, and loading screens. I'm on a Snapdragon 865 and I can properly enjoy all the beautiful environments and the load times are less than a second.",Positive
"The amount of quality of life Updates are worthy of 5 stars, story is beautiful, goals are achievable in a reasonable time, generous with in game gifts (compared to another big game they have), there is content drought from time to time, but that is expected from such a high quality, rather new, game.",Positive
"The game is still new at this point and once you finish the story, there are no more contents to play with. Relic farming is a waste of time until you reach player level 40+. I would still give this game a chance now since the plot is good and in the future, mihoyo is very likely to release a limited time event along with new story. Edit: relic farming system is complete garbage. If you hate pointless grinding, this game's endgame would be garbage for you.",Negative
I played genshin impact from the start and i say that's the best game and when I got to know hoyoverse is launching new open world called starrail i was egarly waiting for it but I'm very disappointed after playing the game the graphics are awesome but the open world is very restricted and the worst part is the battle if you stumble opon any enemy you'll get teleport to arena where each character and enemy get turn to hit and that's very boring i was really hoping for genshin like gameplay,Negative
"Great experience so far. I love how the characters personality are fun to interact with. I hope the major content can be a little bit faster to release, the current pace is a bit slow, but no pressure, masterpieces does take time to produce.",Positive
"Been enjoying the game, but it won't let me login today on my phone it keeps telling there's a network error even though I've been using it fine for everything YouTube,twitch, etc. I already uninstalled and installed it again but it still keeps saying network error I'm confused.Edit:next day it's working now don't know what happened.",Positive
"Game is great, app design with Google is awful. Can't link the app to my pc account because Google automatically made a separate account, despite using the same email. Now deleting the mobile profile, but that apparently has a 30 day delay so the app will be useless for me for a month. By all means, get the app and enjoy the game, just be careful in case this bites you too.",Negative
"Number one Where the h*** are your items during a fight number 2 When your character goes down where the h***'s a Phoenix down or revival item to get him back up number 3 there's 3 useless characters in the game that. Have no insanificant value of helping their skills suck I prefer damaged skills,not helping skills that are just useless. They should have fixed it like final fantasy have health items during a fight and also items that can revive your characters in a fight just like final fantasy",Negative
"I am a big fan of Honkai: Star Rail! Having played Honkai: Impact 3rd, I was initially unsure about the turn-based combat system in Star Rail, but HoYoverse did an excellent job with it. Regarding performance, I have been playing on a OnePlus 7 Pro using low graphics settings and 30 fps to save battery life. My strategy is to ignore all banners and collect as much stellar jade as possible for Luocha and Blade!",Positive
"overall my experience is the best! but still a few problems this and that. After the Blade update my game's always crashes and lagging so much, before the update, it never been that much broken. I suppose because of the server overload? I'm really hoping for the devs to fix this!!",Positive
"Unfortunately this game has given me 0 reason to give it any good rating. Once playing it felt very boring, and almost exactly like every other game out there. As soon as an ""Auto"" mode is implemented I no longer consider it a game. Turn based battles with two attack options with the occasional third. Less then pokemon. Zero strategy needed. False advertising with an 80 free pull welcome package. You only get 20, the other 60 are just regular level progression like every other pull game.",Negative
"The game is great, but the problem is that It always crashes or sometimes there are problems loading the resources of the game and it makes the game very much unenjoyable; my phone runs smoothly with other games like genshin impact so I don't know why this game is always causing problems.",Negative
"the story and mission are too complicated for simple fighting turn-based game, it waste so many space on my phone (almost 10GB), I was hype at the first, I think it would be like turn-based game such summoners war sky arena or awaken chaos era, thousands monsters/heroes with many strategic skills and build, but its not.",Positive
"Where to even start with this game, well to start, music is absolutely fantastically done. VA is on point and adds to every character. The character designs and traits are well done. The game play is also very well done. I'm looking forward to future chapters!",Positive
"Good as a single player game. But after about a week you will have beaten everything there is to do in the game. The events so far took all only took about 10 minutes to complete, then there is nothing to do again.... and the entire event rewards gives you enough for like 3 pulls, whereas you need 160 pulls to guaranteed get the banner characters. Stay away.",Negative
"Love the game overall and is definitely the best one I've played in several years. Would like to see controller support added for playing on pc because with the setup im running, keyboard controls aren't really feasible.",Positive
Game release was smooth. Never run into any problem with the servers. The game is good I like turn-based rpg that's why. The characters have different personalities. The mc is not really muted and the dialogues got me laughing every now and then. T Kudos to the writers you guys must've enjoyed making these scripts lol. The game runs smoother than I expected on my old phone so it's a plus (primarily a pc player),Positive
"Honestly one of THE coolest and most fun games ive ever gotten to play on mobile. im waiting for this to release on PS4/console when it can and im super excited for it!! only thing is that leveling up takes a while and is very tedious, having to do side quests foe exp, but other than that, i love it!!",Positive
"Dear Hoyoverse, thanks for creating this amazing game out of nowhere. I didn't expect a turn based rpg game can be this interesting. However, I got the biggest problem here. When the cutscenes plays, they're all broken even though my device is compatible and can run Genshin Impact very well.",Negative
"10 out of 5. It's the best turn-based game I've ever played. Yes, it is a TURN-BASED gacha game with rich story, cute and funny characters, and lots of wide maps you can FREELY ROAM about. It's definitely not boring unlike most turn-based games. You can also earn lots of Stellar Jades and Passes you can use to summon characters early, unlike Genshin which will take you longer to get a 5 star unit, so I'd say the devs are fairly generous. Keep up the great work! I look forward to future updates.",Positive
"I enjoy it, but my game crashes and lags alot now specially if I try to pull. If you can, can you try to fix it perhaps? Also the part where some assets don't load like the floor and the walls of some buildings.",Negative
This is a very cool game tbh i love it!! I know it's a new game so theres a lot of bugs and stuff so I hope we can get good compensation rewards! Overall the graphics are good its just laggy :') Okay so now I'm getting an error code so I cant play the game it was fine yesterday though,Positive
"The 1 star reviewers are so bad at reading and learning to research online. Literally trashing the game when they don't even realize they signed up for predownload and complain when they can't play it pre-launch. Also braindead people who just blindly plays the game thinking that it's ""Another Genshin"" and put 1 star review for being turn based. Overall great game, wish the pull rates could be a bit higher and gear upgrade system not be heavy roll based. Great room for improvement for the game.",Positive
I hope in the new update of your game will you recommend it in my device Techno Spark 6 Go it's so glitch and lagging it's sometimes crash and unplayable but it's a great game in its first release but in its several updates it's starts to crash and lagging it's even hard to see the places like I can sell all the loopholes in your game it's like left4deads cheat like the noclip you can see everything and if you go in a portal or dungeon it's so glitch.,Negative
"My biggest problem is that my phone overheats after playing for 5 to 10 minutes after launching the app . Another issue is that the cut scenes for my device doesn't sync up properly, and the voice acting is very statically, which makes it harder to listen to during the cutscences . So once problems get fixed by optimizing it to my device, I'll happily rate the game higher. I just can't play the game or enjoy playing with these issues in play, which is a real pain since ive wanted to starrail .",Negative
"The game itself is amazing. Loved playing it. After the recent update, I tried playing again, but after trying to log in, the game crashes. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but that didn't fix it",Positive
"I'm loving the game so far, putting in the hard hours. I don't do reviews, but when I heard this game was getting review bombed because it's turn base, I knew I had to do something. This is for you people that are mad, you had about 2 years TWO YEARS, to see that's turn base. If you don't like turn base that's fine, but it doesn't mean the game's bad. This game is great for being a turn base gacha game. Some people out there just don't there's different types of video games. Amazing game.",Positive
"It was fun when I was able to play it, but now it doesn't even load in. It gets to the loading bar for the resources and then just crashes. I have all the updates and it never says anything as far as an error message, it just kicks me.",Negative
"The game would be fun at all but the only problem is that i cant download it,i have enough storage but it keeps restarting over and over again, Its so annoying to press hsr all over and over again,i havent even played yet and Its already bad. I just want to play hsr calmly instead of not,so please fix this bug, whenever Im downloading file resources or whatever Its called it keeps crashing and restarting,and if i leave it wont continue the download,it just makes it go back from scratch.",Negative
The presentation is absolutely incredible! This is a very immersive turn-based RPG! It plays absolutely incredible and is a blast to play. I am super excited for the PS5 release. Please keep it up and keep releasing incredible games! I hope you keep adding to this game!!!,Positive
"Great game. The turn-based Battling system is kinda what you would expect from other similar games in the same genre, but the artwork and character flairs here definitely make it better than most. Great storytelling, funny conversations and character personalities. Love all the to and fro Easter egg/story & character references from HI3 and even Genshin too.",Positive
"So far I love Star Rail, I've been playing everyday since the release and never have I felt bored of playing. The gameplay feels really good, the story is amazing and the characters are lovely. It is a gacha game, which may push people away from the game and I can understand that, however I love gambling so this is not an issue for me. Do I recommend it? Absolutely.",Positive
"Beautiful game, amazing story, fun gameplay. I'm a genshin player and I wasn't sure how I would feel a out the lack of open world but, I can confidently day after probably 20 or so hours of playing that this is a new favorite game for me! For a gotcha game, it's been very generous with the funds to pull.",Positive
"Wonderful game, would probably replay JUST to experience the story again. Here are some things I've taken note of; Beautiful graphics on mobile AND PC. The voice acting is some of the best I've ever heard, giving the story a realistic feel. Unlike Genshin, H:SR isn't multiplayer, but you CAN add your friends on it and request some of their characters to come into battle with you. The combat mechanics are astounding, it's turn based.",Positive
"Quite Fun I Guess, I'm not a big fan of turn base game. Especially after hack & slash genre game come out. But surprisingly this game is reminded me of back old days of Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts and Persona games. When we focus more to the story rather the gameplay. I hope the story will become more interesting and more fantastic in the future. And the loading so much faster than Genshin, hope the size will not get too big in the future too..",Positive
"This is probably the best turn-base gacha I've ever seen and it even feels as good as the likes of persona 5 and fire emblem. The graphics is good and the animation are is amazing, the gameplay is your usual turn-base and there's nothing wrong with that. The story so far is pretty good and the characters are likable.",Positive
"Very good turn based game, it applies a lot of factors that genshin lacks and improved upon them. Although it's a different game genre, it is very fun and all characters feel balanced and useful to carry you through the game",Positive
This game is really fun so far however i do have one problem with it it keeps crashing out of nowhere for me and i have to re open it over and over again just to keep advancing in the game. Please fix this bug its very annoying,Positive
"I like the game. But in the 3 months I played it, I've had to downgrade the graphics settings twice: from medium to low to lowest. At this rate, I'll have to give up the game within another 3 months.",Negative
"This game is a turn based RPG, akin to the likes of FGO, FFBE or Octopath Travellers. The game takes place in the multiverse of the Honkai Impact series, new comers can expect to be surprised by the depth of the lore and gameplay, while fans of the series can expect lots of familiar characters but with a pleasent surprise to each of them, all and all it's a worthwhile game to try out.",Positive
"The lore and the characters are very well designed. However, some gameplay like Herta's world becomes skyrocketly difficult even on Stage 2. Even though the stage recommends Level 35 characters, it actually needs high level well built characters. If it goes in this direction, I am afraid it will become like Genshin's spiral abyss where you need limited 5 star characters and still struggle to complete them; in other words, a pay 2 win game.",Positive
"A very good game with enough content that you can comfortably play for a few hours a day for a few days and still have some content to go. Unfortunately, like Genshin impact, it does have a severe lack of content after said content is done and thus making it only have your normal dailies after its done. The lack of open world also contributes to this. On the otherhand, the story and gameplay is beautiful and something I'm looking forward to see every update.",Positive
"So, the game is pretty and fun, that's a fact. Outside of that the game has an EXTREME amount of problems for anyone that's not spendinf money. The resource grind, number one, is the worst I've ever had in any mobile game. Even if you are spending you can make little to no progress per day (from level 40) to characters, gear, talents and the like. It's an extreme problem that if not corrected almost immediately will make this game die very quickly after the new game rush wears off. That's #1",Negative
"Great game, got addicted fastüòÖ, tho i have an issue to point out, when leaving the forgotten hall, there seem to be a glitch where my character got out of bounds of the express, it didnt affect my gameplay but its just a funny glitch where it seems i am outside the express, i hope it can be fixed soon, luv the game‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
"Great game that the devs clearly put a lot of effort into. It's sad to see it be poorly reviewed either because it's turn based and not the same game play style as genshin impact or that it's too much like genshin with its style of quest, gacha, and world level. People need to realize that genshin is genshin, and Star Rail is a different game entirely and would stop comparing the two.",Positive
Kind of fun gameplay.. but they never shut up.. really would enjoy this game if they just shut up and didn't force the narrative so hard. It honestly becomes annoying/overwhelming. I enjoy the fight play but omg... They just do not shut up. If you want to spend 75% of your time smashing your screen while getting frustrated because they won't shut up. Then this game is for you.,Negative
"Already better than genshin in terms of rewarding the player. Still lacking compared to the now finished story 1 of honkai impact 3rd in terms of story (it's a new game duh) The Memeable interaction, the gorgeous music, nice model, himeko üò≠ My friend said it's a shame that this is a turn based game. People have opinion so be it. I stick to 4 stars because this is still on going. Might go up through the updates or might be go down if somehow the devs turned greedy like GI did.",Positive
"It's astounding how good this game is. It's not just another gacha title. Quality of this is on par with many console games. Writing, voice acting, gameplay, all of it exceptional. Better boss fights then some contemporary JRPGs. Gacha is decently generous too but you don't need to rely on it to get through the game either. There is a reason everyone is playing this and you should as well.",Positive
"Everything is going smoothly so far, but the fact that this is a turn based game yet it doesn't require that much strategy makes it way too easy in my opinion. But, since it's still in the very early stage I'll let it slide. Good luck devs and keep up the good work!",Positive
"It's a good experience, it's story are very nice and Graphics are awesome . It's a very good f2p game, charector and animation are good but i can't give 5 Star because we can't play with friends and it's some time crash and audio glitch etc.",Positive
I love the game the action and the scenery and the music and everything is just so beautiful and awesome the only thing Im disappointed about is that you can't change your character's skin color when you get your character their only white I would like to change my character skin color to Brown that's the only thing I'm disappointed about but everything else has magnificent!,Positive
"I couldn't download genshin, but I'm glad I could download this! Great gameplay, story and generous rewards(especially for f2ps like me) Not to mention the pretty and handsome charactersüòè(and I'm here for it!)‚ú® The devs are rlly considerate and humorous esp. with the entertainment they give us with the dialogues (one of my fav. Is the relationship our character has with the things around them for ex. are the trashcans and lamppostsüòÜ) Rlly love the game and will look forward for more updates!üíñ",Positive
"How do I describe this? It's amazing. The graphics are incredible, and I love how serious and unserious the dialogue can be. The gameplay is great, I love how much strategy is put into it. Sure it has some crashes and errors, but hopefully it'll be fixed in the future.",Positive
"The game is very detailed,and nice storyline, characters, but I have one issue on the game,Whenever I/Players log in,It will always say Error 1001_3/or Error 1001/3,Even my internet's very high and very strong,I clear storage for it,it will still say that error message.",Positive
"Pls make ALL the cutscenes skippable. Some people don't really care about the story, and just want to fight. The some of the dialogue for npcs and characters in cutscenes (when seeing for first time) is interesting but others are kinda boring (Herta dolls space station, sometimes Pom Pom, etc.), and some are just downright annoying. I understand the game has only been recently released but theres too few characters and not enough content. Definitely room for improvement.",Negative
"I really love this game! It's perfect for mobile. It's easy to play, and there are so many quality of life changes from other Hoyoverse games. I would recommend anyone that enjoys other Hoyo games to give this one a try. I have been playing genshin since basically launch and got kinda burned out. This was the perfect switch and a refreshing change of pace!",Positive
Very beautiful game. Some get great character's for free others get the same after 1000's dollars. Drop rates are horrible and the game so game slow unless you skip. So expensive. But you don't have to spend to play but to get any of the good character's better open the wallet.,Negative
"Honestly this was fun at first. The turn based combat was fine and getting to rush at enemies and whack them to start battles was fun. So far, the story is interesting, but the game is way too grind heavy. The enemy levels rise fast and you always seem to be super under-leveled against things (even when using items to bring lvls up). Not to mention the Trailblazer level being such a grind, just like Genshin (which is what made me uninstall that game). fun at first but very grindy.",Negative
"This is the best mobile game I've ever played, hands down. The story is excellent, the art is ecellent, everything I find in this game just makes me fall in love with it even more. I have lost sleep playing it, exploring every nook and cranny. Please just try it out, I beg of you.",Positive
"I would have rated higher but i really didn't like the fact that the combat system is not real time instead it's turn system likes old time games my some of boring why we have to load to battle mode and when bettle over load back such a waste of time. Now that's my 3 star rating for it other then that everything things superb talk about graphic, character design, story, music etc they are great. In the end my conclusion is that it may be not my liking of combat style but some other people do lik",Negative
"This is amazing. An open world rpg with turn based combat is something I've always loved, and since turned based combat is new to Mihoyo (Hoyoverse idk anymore) i gotta say they did real good job. Only complaint is that they basically recycled the genshin impact UI instead of it having its own unique UI but thats no big deal, just wanted to point that out. What sold me was the character references to Honkai Impact, their first game. Characters like Bronya, Himeko, Seele, and Cocolia are some.",Positive
"Great story telling in my opinion, mostly the side quests, and character specific ones (I almost cried at Natasha's and Clara's backstory SOO GOOD). Fun gameplay (again in my opinion), it's a turn based game with not too much mechanics or spells or anything, BUT fun. If it's not your cup of tea, I would still give it a chance just for the story. It's a gatcha game soo it's inherently p2w, but in my 50 hours of f2p game time I had a lot of fun and challenge, and hope to have more.",Positive
The game is great. It's a bit laggy but playable but I am currently experiencing a bug that when I interact with any npc or do literally anything the game freeze's and lag. Please fix the bug for me the game is unplayable right now. :(,Positive
I really liked the game at the first patch I hand problems like login error code 1001.3 it always shows up like 3 times before I can actually play but this new patch made it more complicated as always I'm doing my daily routine of 3-4 times of login error before playing but now it's like I've been login forever and it doesn't start and the loading screen of the train is incomplete so now I'm complaining hoyoverse pls fix this,Negative
Good game the most f2p friendly game I played so far and hope that it could continue that way because my past experience in games from hoyoverse like honkai impact 3rd was pretty bad because of the sudden change of meta almost every version but I think that this game is not gonna be like that because there is no competitive aspect in the game just get characters and go with what you have anyways enjoying the story so far and progressed through the campaign smoothly despite being free to play.,Positive
"The developer added quite interesting linking attack/defense mechanics on certain characters which unfortunately in the super duper extra rare category. Other than that, Star Rail is one of the best character collection turn based sci-fi strategy game.",Positive
"It's not perfect, especially at the beginning. The main story starts out as kinda meh, but it gets soo good afterwards. Characters look amazing and aren't just bland copies of each other (both personality and looks vice) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
I played all the Hoyoverse games this probably my favorite of the series. It's a classic turn base RPG where you have to strategy your next moves base on the mobs weakness or when should you use your skills since they all share the same skill points similar to Seven Deadly Sins.,Positive
"After playing for a few weeks, I'm amazed at how well written everything is. The amount of ""dry"" humor between the characters keeps the story from overpowering you. There is a lot of content and all of it is voiced. I would easily say that it's the best written game on mobile at the moment. Also, they give away a good amount of free gems each day. Its a good game to start because it's one that will be around for years.",Positive
"This game is AMAZING! I definitely recommend you play it. No ads, beautiful characters, great graphics and powers! Although problem is I die of boredom because I'm currently on the astral express, I'm a new player but I already understand everything!",Positive
"Ngl it's super simple, way too simple. This story is complexed and has had writing so it's hard to even pay attention and understand what's happening. You only get 2 atks, and there's like no characters compared to any other TBG. Meta is everything that matters, the fights are dragged out for way too long. They out almost no effort into making it a fun game and it's extremely underwhelming.",Negative
"Loved the game at first but after playing it for sometime I realised how stuck I was in the game. Most semi-open world genre games always have this sort of feel to them, but this game in particular feels more excruciatingly boring because of the monotonous turn-based fighting.",Negative
"The game is good but 1 star for 2 reasons. 1. There is a bug where if i exit the app and enter again, i get a black screen and have to reopen the app. 2. The story is interesting, but imho, they need to get more organized since i was told we weren't gonna get any story until version 1.6 (we are currently at 1.3 and each version happens like once every 1 or 2 months) and also the story felt kinda rushed and we were left on a cliffhanger until 1.4 üíÄ",Negative
Museum Glitch: If the level is above the required level for an objective it won't recognize it hit the level and won't complete it. My general hall was level 8 instead of 7 and the objective doesn't get completed. Right now it's level 10 and it's still there.,Positive
"It was a great game. However, i encountered some bugs when i pull in the warp banner, it didn't show the animation in pulling at the game will just turn green and the 3d model just show without its design.",Positive
"Seems like a great game I guess I just found it via a fake clickbait ad that said if you downloaded the game from that video you would get 50 free pulls, I was so excited to use them but it turns out I didn't get any for downloading from the ad. Great game though!",Positive
"I'm kinda disappointed. First 2 regions were absolutely perfetct. What the hell happened with the third one?! All the locations are just mazes with tons of stupidest minigames. Same with a story. For example, take Kafka's interrogation - government's most important device suddenly got broken, go around the place and do some child riddels to repair it. Is this some kind of children's morning show? Just why??? I seriously want to erase third region from my memory cuz I liked this game so much...",Positive
"I want to give 5 stars, because the story, characters, art, animation, and my personal favorite, THE MUSIC, absolutely deserve that. Everything except for a couple things are flawless. The game feels TOO MUCH like Genshin when it comes to controls and animation style. The UI is familiar and nice but I would have loved to see a completely original UI that lets you interact with characters from/in the party screen. Overall, this feels like Genshin 2, as opposed to ""Honkai Star Rail"". 8/10 bangers",Positive
"I been having some problems with the cutscenes because the audio keeps cutting every second, the graphics keeps glitching and I have to log in multiple times just to play the game and there's nothing wrong with my internet but I do enjoy playing the game although I haven't been lucky on getting 5 star",Positive
"This game is Amazing, but it has room to Improve If you play genshin impact first, it takes a bit too get used to it but they're both pretty great games. This game doesn't have the two-player option but the way that you battle I see that that would definitely to work out. They are amazing games this company has great graphics and I insist you play any games that they create.",Positive
"It's better than genshin impact made by the same company but that wasn't a high bar to beat, still very sub par for a gacha game with a horrible gacha system, rips off fate grand orders craft essences but makes them count toward pity which is just bad game design and they should be ashamed of themselves. And lots of time gated content which makes the game a slog. The turn based combat is definitely fantastic and there's lots of potential, hopefully they take note from their betters.",Positive
"It has the same bad storyline and dialogues like Genshin Impact, and also forces you to go through the whole thing. Developer needs to learn from their mistakea ; get a real writer or allow players to skip. Characters plot are all cliche reused from other franchises. Graphics are not too bad, gameplay is crippled by hours of tapping on screen to get the bad conversations moving just to progress to next part of game...",Negative
"This game is surprisingly good! Everything is easy to understand, the graphics are really smooth and the story is interesting. Besides a login issue, my first impressions were positive. I think that this game has a lot of potential, can't wait to see it grow :D",Positive
"Bro most of the 1 star reviews come from the people complaining that it's turn based lmaoüíÄ, like you don't go to an rts game and complain its rts. Like you can't go here and complain just because it isn't to your liking. Besides for the graphic and lag issues and other stuff like that. This game is meant to run on high-end devices thats how it accomplishes its amazing graphics and animations.",Positive
"This is my 1st time playing a MMORPG, 1 of my younger cousins plays Genshin & üíì it. In fact he designs weapons for it. I once had a intense discussion w/ him about it. He is 30 odd yrs younger than I am. He is technically my cousin's son. However we discovered that we both have a üíì of anime, gaming, and Technology. He then suggested that I try out 1 of the games. I am hopelessly un-hand-eye coordinated. Yet I've found that if I concentrate I can navigate slowly. I üíì it, TY!",Positive
"I've only come to expect fun, graphically intensive games from Hoyoverse and this game doesn't disappoint. The missions that have you bouncing back and forth between NPCs isn't very fun, but everything else has been pretty good.",Positive
"Fun turn based RPG, feels like it would be right at home on console. Really fun story and characters. The gacha system and ability to gather free crystals is a bit stingier than Honkai 3rd, and some of the daily quests can be tedious. Overall though, really solid game",Positive
"Superb game, I am not gonna lie to yalls or to myself, but currently the lacking of rewards has halted my progress or strategies because I can't build all the other characters I want besides my core team. I know this is a gacha game, I understand that, but the amount of credits needed for upgrades that boost your damage slightly feels a bit unfair. Anyways that's all. Thank you for making a great game. Pls more pulls and events in the future.",Positive
My account is stolen. While I took a break from playing the game. Didn't want to burn myself out. I try to log in my account and a pop up said that I have been gone for a while needed to log in manually. This pop look just like the term of service check list. I did that and I'm back at the start of the game. My friends says they see my characters in there friends list. But I can't get in my account. I spent money on this game and a welkin for 2mos.,Negative
"It's a really interesting game like Genshin Impact! My phone is old, so I usually have my game with bad quality and very laggy. I think it's just me, but the cutscenes are kinda confusing for me, but of course I won't blame for it, it's probably my cluelessness. A really good game!",Positive
"I feel bad for those who rated 1 star to this game, bruh upgrade/buy your new device, if you have potato mobile just dont force yourself to play it, hyv doesnt force you either. Anyway, I really really love this game, the character, the story, the lore, and the gameplay oh how I missed playing turn-based game. Overall everything seems fine to me, the rewards are also very exciting. Now where is Blade banner ‚ù§ Edited : YEAHH I GOT BLADE AND HIS LC ‚ú®‚ú®",Positive
"A very fun and refreshing game! I love it so much more than Hoyoverse's other games. <3 My only problem is there isn't much to do in terms of talking to NPCs, but they're fleshed out as much as they could possibly be at the moment. I really just want more RPG in this RPG game. I hope some updates expand upon the worlds in the future!",Positive
"Games amazing you did it again I really enjoy the funny lines they added and characters designs there so prettyy and the story is nice either then these things the feature ""friends"" has no point yet it's fine alright but would really be nice to at least text friends either then that the game is really amazing I would recommend if you like gacha rpg games",Positive
Played for 2 days and now uninstalling. Good game though with nice graphics and easy to understand combat system. Cutscenes that can't be skipped is just a waste of time. Didn't get a 5 star even though the banner states it guarantees it after 50 warps. Another thing is that this game causes my phone to heat up and drain the battery even if the graphics is set to medium. This is not my idea of fun.,Negative
"overall its a nice game, it's the 2nd most downloaded app. It's really fun and exciting. But mostly all of the genshin players have switched to this game. It's not a big deal at all, I'm just saying that yellow gotta be loyal...fr. whenever I log in my account, it just says log in error.. uhm. fix that.",Positive
the late game progression is very slow such that it's weeks between major power level improvement for the characters. this severely hampers the sense of progression satisfaction. I recommend giving more ways to obtain stamina through daily missions and events.,Positive
"Good game overall, although expect more different types of combat systems in the future because just turn based will become boring after some time, atleast some additional graphics could keep things entertaining, and for god's sake please keep a jump button!",Positive
Enjoying the game so far. Not the biggest fan of the combat style (turn based). Prefer genshin but at least it has auto battle most of the time. But so far great characters. Biggest complaint is no auto battle with bosses or higher rank NPCs. Plz Dezs add auto battle to those also.,Positive
This game is Awesome!!! Beautiful cutscenes after beautiful cutscenes. Their character development makes me feel connected to each individual character. I love playing when I have some free time between two things. I just got to the end and I wish there was more!!,Positive
"Devs should be ashamed of their storage handling for a phone game. Requires double the space of version 1.0 to update to version 1.1. Requires more storage space than 16gb model phones ship with post formatting. But the worst part is the games only 8.5gb after update. The 7gb game makes you download nearly an entire other near 7gb at the same time, almost all of which is garbage it won't even keep. The only way to get around this is to uninstal the base 7gb and download the new 8.5gb instead.",Negative
I hardly notice any drops considering that i play on a 4 year old Helio G80 powered phone and on medium graphics but that probably is thanks to my phone cooler which minimizes my phone's temperature. Overall the missions/stories are easy to understand making my experience pretty enjoyable. You can also level up fast without spending a dime which is the reason i love this game.,Positive
"It is pretty, but a step bacwards compared to their flagship tile. When you have a open world game like Genshin Impact, going bact to turn based combat feels like lazy coding. I feel bad saying this considering how much time and effort that must have go into making this game. But hoyoverse is capable of a lot more.",Negative
"It is good. I got Clara as my begginer wish character, she is very cute but i would of rather had Bronya. I also got Himeko from the standard banner. The story is very entertaining, the relations to Honkai Impact 3rd is also very interesting. However I do not understand the Aeons and what they are. I think the character designs are very cool and very pretty, the gameplay is also very fun! I am going to be saving for Kafka and Blade since they seem to be cool, i really hope they are playable :))",Positive
"Really surprising that such a good game is made by the same company that made genshin which is an utter time-sink trash. HSR has really good characters, not much time waste and direct story quests, much much better male characters and amazing female characters, fun gameplay, overall a very casual game. U can care less about meta and pull for whoever tf u like and be happy. Quite f2p which was also shocking, overall a very good, casual game.",Positive
Overall the game is great. I've just had issues with the last 2 events with it force closing on me. So close to finishing aetherium wars but once I manual any battle it closes. And as for the simulated universe it boots me out at the boss stage,Positive
"Other than a few bugs which have been very minor for me, it's worse for pc players, this game has been top quality triple A. My ONLY problem is that we can't skip cutscenes and dialogue. Everything else? Phenomenal üòôü§å",Positive
"Highest quality mobile game right now along with genshin. This game is lighter on world exploration but since this game doesn't need to make huge world like genshin it seems a lot of effort is put into making events and mini games, which I actually like. Main issue with this game is this game go hard on FOMO. Once you miss out on content it's gone. Also, this game isn't too nice with new players, catching up with the latest content is difficult because it mostly care for day 1 players.",Positive
"Was hyped before this released but now I'm disappointed. Gameplay is good but nothing new just the same as later chapters of honkai campaigns. It's the English va and bland story that annoys me. Ngl cutscenes are good but going through half an hour of speaking makes me want to also skip them. Worse of all, you can't skip these boring dialogues.",Negative
"PLEASE add some sort of multiplayer interaction. Raids, world bosses, guilds, pvp!??? Please dont follow the same path as Genshin. Any sort of multiplayer interaction adds a constant pressure to improve your team. Without these mechanics you are just leveling your characters to see bigger numbers in the visual novel. Otherwise this game has lots of charm and QOL improvements. The longevity of the game is is certainly a concern if all thats going to be added is more unskippable cutscenes.",Negative
"I play the game since the release the version 1.0 I'd all fine with one issue before I can play the game it needs to force shut down and restart the game so I can clearly play the game that's why I use other phone to play fixed the game, but the version 1.2 k came back from the game I have a big problem where the train is not full fixed and the map is keep disappearing, and while i downloaded it 3 hours or more I can't play it, it just shut down. Please fixed my game.",Positive
"Love this game, I am so obsessed. But there is an issue that I face. Usually when there's an update, the game needs to download ressources. Unfortunately for me, the downloading nerver works right. It just happened now, and im going to try to re install the game to fix it.",Positive
"Best game I have ever played aside from genshin. Everything was so good. There is even some humorous dialouges. The graphucs was so good, the story, the music. I can't describe it properly but damn. Hoyoverse has always exceeded my expectations.",Positive
"At first, I saw hoyoverse the creators and developers of Genshin Impact, creating this game Called Honkai Star Rail, and I had no idea what it was, but I had to give it a shot, I wasn't expecting it to be good, BUT MY GOD THE GAME SO FAR IS AMAZING! Good Introduction and Lovable Characters, I've played RPG Games like the Persona series and Final Fantasy, and already fell in love with the Combat System! Also VERY F2P FRIENDLY! Offering Almost like 100+ Spins compared to Genshin Impact.",Positive
"the general gameplay is good, but i feel like im just playing Honkai Star no rails because of graphic issues and there isnt even a train to ride on were floating, and in belobog, were floating in the skies that's as far as I have endured playing it, i wanted to enjoy it, because the game is in my play store, but the game itself makes it hard for me my point is all I'm asking for is better optimization",Negative
Please fix the bug. My character is still stuck even if I already reinstalled the app like 2x Edit: It's already fixed! I've had no issues after it got fixed. It only took at least a day or two for the devs to fix it. Thank you for fixing it!,Negative
I mean like its easier to play than Genshin and more rewards but I feel like there are barely any exploration needed. Hope they increase the map sizes. I also feel like we need more food because collecting recipes and food is one of my favourite activities in both Genshin and Star Rail.,Negative
"Hands down the best game from Hoyoverse so far. Just wish they'd lower the in-game top-up price for all their gacha games. I can only hope while I help Pom-Pom sweep the floor on Astral Express... Although I do have one issue with this game on my android.. I have 2 accs, and only 1 acc can be successfully logged-in on my phone. Where else I can log-in both my accounts on my PC, just not on my phone. I've tried re-installing the app but still fail to log-in that acc. Wish they would fix this bug.",Positive
"Couldnt exactly get to play on my phone as the game kept saying that there are was an error when logging in but I have played the PC version and it's a good game, I just don't recommend playing it on mobile because of the lag and bugs.",Negative
"Okay, so I'll preface and say I'm addicted to this game and I wish I could do 4.5 stars. I love turn based rpgs as someone who has spent hundreds of hours in games like Pokemon and Fire Emblem and came from Genshin Impact. The game has good graphics and works quite well on mobile in comparison to GI due to the nature of gameplay. Graphics and animations are good, it's a bit laggy for older phones like my s10 but still playable. KEEP IN MIND THIS IS GACHA. And hyv rates are known for being bad.",Positive
"Very nice graphics and Good looking characters even though you cannot really jump or fly like genshin it is quite satisfying and a good game for people who dont have time all day to explore. Story is good as well even though I haven't played Honkai Impact, you can still play without being confused with the story.",Positive
"i love this game sm!! The character details are also good, the quest is entertaining which makes it a fun game to play. Although i have diffuculties to build characters since i dont understand. But overall this game is so good, i reccomend !! Bosses are kinda hard for me tho since i only did 2k damage the highest at lvl 29 so its not rly good..",Positive
"Great story-based RPG with a breathtaking setting. The turn-based battles reward strategy and utilizing certain elements, for which F2P options are very usable in the game's current state. The updates contain rich character stories and often unique mini-games.",Positive
"I love this game but I uninstalled it after the big update, I downloaded it again because I miss hsr but I can't play it like before anymore. The game freezes when I'm entering combat or Wondering in the map and it's really frustrating, it seems like I can't play this game with just 4gb ram anymore which is sad because I've lot of progress in this game and I can't enjoy it anymore. I hope you make it playable with lower phones again. I'm really gonna miss this gameüòî thank you for understanding.",Positive
It's fun and I actually like a genshin related game because when I see genshin gameplay it just feels like a legend of Zelda remake just with a different story I liked the turn based and type advantage stuff only problem is waiting forever to download extra bits and somebits where there should have been voicelines for the normal characters aren't there also the custom character can be cracked as hell,Positive
"i love everything, the animation, story, even the interactions! its so fun to play and the way that everyone has their own personalities excite me. definitely a game you would want to play!! you can enjoy it thoroughly without rushing through the stories too!!",Positive
"The gameplay is good, the graphics is good, the game itself is magnificent. But, I cant play it since there is always that log in error which is ""error 1001_3"". Hopefully this gets patched soon, I'm looking forward to play it :)",Negative
"Mihoyo never disappoints player in their game (except Genshin iykyk) and this game is like a nice choice for gacha players because you can AFK and the fact it is a turn-based game. Talking about graphics, va, music, and sound effects - all of them are the best. If you want game where it is a turn-based game, open-world and can interact with your character's NPC, this game is for you.",Positive
"By far one of the best turn based games I've ever played. Gameplay wise, the game is an open world, more similar to Genshin Impact rather than Honkai Impact 3rd, its namesake. The style of the game is as should be expected from a Mihoyo game. You can also expect a similar gacha system to Genshin's, but far as my experience goes, it isn't as painful. Grinding for your characters are similar to Genshin with a Relic and Traces system Overall very recommended if you like turn based games.",Positive
"3 stars because pls help me: i started the game, made an account for it, it updated and restarted, okay. When the game loaded back up it just stays stuck in the cool background train, i waited for about ten minutes, tapped all over the screen, and nothing. It's like the game is softlocked or something, pls help me.",Negative
"Everything is just alright - the graphic, the story plot and fighting scene....But there are one problem for mobile players which is OVER HEATING...I hope you can fix it because i already played genshin and my phone is not over heat at balanced graphics...Thanks :)",Positive
"It's Honkai Impact but turn based style? I expecting flexible exploration in overworld like genshin, but no, well it's not bad really. At least I love the music, graphic and Persona-like combat style. I maybe spend more time or money if it has a character that voiced by my fav voice actrees, but I will drop it for now",Negative
"This game is borderline unplayable First thing after you open the game, the log in screen lagging and glitching everywhere After opening the game you will be greeted by more glitches and the environment is like gone I can still play the game but the bad parts about this was: chest/treasures and barrels are invisible, you have to rely on the map because of the environment, and lastly the lags became more concerning and crashes does occur often",Negative
"I understand that this is different game from any other Mihoyo games and I want to rate it as a standalone game but I can't do it because the game reuses everything from previous games. Everything is the same, login screen sequence, elements and classes - other wording but same, character screen and stat window, progression system, leveling system, battlepass, gacha rates, value and usage of paid currency. It's turn based which is not a problem but that's all there is.",Negative
"Well, Played it more since last time and still in the phase of gear farming of course but at least the process ain't super painful although it is still lacking a bit but still acceptable. I believe the game will be fun for those who love turn based or strategy games. But the least I hope the gacha system of the general banner won't be the same as Honkai Impact 3rd or Genshin Impact at all where very first characters are those available in general banner for a year or more then then 1 by 1 added",Positive
"So far so good. The game is generous enough to give you enough characters to build 2 decent teams even as f2p. Though some end-game contents like MOC are hard to clear using f2p team. My biggest concern right now is the lack of resources. Maxing chars need a ton of resources. Hope they provide more energy in the future or make the resources easier to get. All in all, it is f2p friendly but it will take a lot longer to build your chars and teams compared to spenders who can refresh energy.",Positive
Lately the game keeps crashing or extremely laggy. Other than that it's absolutely fun. I love the graphics and storyline. I hope this matter gets fix for a another experience,Positive
Graphic and visuals are good. But confusing to go to particular path. Have to look through a lot. There is no customization for character. Plus character tools to equip is confusing.,Negative
"just started playing again after a long hiatus. lose 5050 again. damn, time to stop playing",Negative
"Hoyo's take on the traditional turn-based mobile game. It feels very polished but it's not particularly inventive or exceptional, especially after something like Genshin. They appear to have copied Genshin's awful monetization, be prepared to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars to pull the character you want. Not bad, reasonably entertaining. Keep your wallet in a separate room from the one you're playing in.",Positive
4 stars for now. Everything is so good but im having issues when opening it. It gets stuck in black screen. I will just clear cache the app and it will work again. After i launch the game again for some other time it will get stuck again. Please fix this.,Positive
Honkai Star Rail impresses with stunning character design and captivating world. Engaging writing and enjoyable missions keep players entertained. Free-to-play friendly with simple fighting mechanics and accessible ability customization. Only drawback is reliance on luck for pulls. A solid gaming experience.,Positive
"The game is indeed very great. However, the trailblazer level reward feels kinda underwhelming, for the reason that the rewards are still almost the same even if you already reached higher level.",Positive
"Star Rail is amazing! Even tho this game has alot of similarities to genshin imapct still it's quite fresh experience for a veteran of genshin player like me. Love the graphics, animations, fluidity, combat neich and story is good too. Star rail I see as a pretty f2p friendly game as it requires you to survive despite of your equipment and team comp as long as you are alive till you kill your enemy You are all good. It's a pretty casual game rn and I love that as I can't give much time to games",Positive
"I really enjoy the game, but I have to say that the gameplay loop after you complete everything does get quite stale especially if you're saving for a character. I find most of the content fairly doable, save for MoC 11+12, which is the only endgame content save for gold & gears I haven't completed fully. It's kind of frustrating that despite Jingliu being released 2 updates ago, it feels like every stage is still catered to her, despite her not even needing ice weakness to be viable.",Positive
"This game is really great from the turn base battle,to the quest,character's interaction to object and people (like the trash) and to the mini games.at first I thought i won't like the game because it's a turn base game but as I play it I began to like it due to smooth battle,the memes and the fact there are all character are useful on the game.",Positive
"For a while, I think there's only few big company brave enough to relive turn-based RPG, as many failed despite huge number fans of this genre. Now, Hoyo basically doing everything good on Genshin Impact, implementing it to turn-based RPG, and even improving it. Nicely done, definitely a great game üôè",Positive
"Great graphics, soundtrack, story telling and battle system. The game takes you about a week and a half to complete and from there everything is blocked behind the ""energy"" system. 180 energy per 16 real life hours seems absolutely guaranteed to last for a month or 2 as a game. There is literally nothing to do in game that does not require this currency (except simulation). Lets hope this is addressed soon before everyone goes for games that actually lets you play!",Negative
"Great game so far. I enjoy the story and gameplay, although I'm not really a fan of turn based game, but thanks to the auto battle system I can enjoy the game more. Also the characters look great, and also fair to the female players, since we have male characters here, unlike Honkai Impact. I love Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail so far, so please Hoyoverse, give me some luck in the game, stop giving me red pity on both game's gacha üòÇ",Positive
"Absolutely astounding. This game has an amazing storyline, and is action-packed with an amazing RPG system and battle style, with so many unique characters and abilities. If you want a good story tagged along with RPG, this is ABSOLUTELY the right game for you!!",Positive
"Very good game. Character is beautiful, animations is gorgeous. I know the game is new so i won't decrease my rating because of it, wished there were more content cause i cleared all mission pretty quickly and now i have to wait so that i can get trailblazer xp. Took me a while before i got to equilibrium 4.",Positive
Amazing overall story building and actual good 3d graphics. The turn based combat may also seem simple but it has many layers of complexity. One of the best turn based games out there for sure.,Positive
"There is this error that says ""Log in error occured, try again later Error code: 1001_3"" At first, I thought it's still possible if I try a lot, it worked for sometime but after the 1.1.0 update, it doesn't work anymore, the game is completely unplayable and doesn't work, I have a lot of fun experience exploring puzzle and stuff and even getting Jing Yuan, they're all gone now because I can't play anymore, I want y'all to fix this error so that others won't experience it.",Negative
If you into turn based game and anime.This game is for you.It got a very beautiful scenery and a fantastic characters.Its also got an excellent story.However if you don't like to farm or put an investment of time in this game it might be difficult (not impossible) but it's your choice to choose how to play this game so don't let my review get on your way to play this fantastic game.,Positive
"Simply uau ! What a sequel from the original...this is the kind of games we should get nowadays. Yes! I have restarted the game because i didn't had the patience to watch the cinematics, and for that i was an idiot... Glad that i realized this early in the game to restart it. Hands down this game is beautiful made. Kudos to the team",Positive
"It's fun and amazing, but I'm not the battle type. I feel like there's more battles than a story, and that really is boring for me. I've never liked fighting in games, so I downloaded this expecting not having to fight a lot. Although it's pretty good. It's good, but a lot of errors have been going on.. It's quite annoying, so I take a break of this game every one in a while. EDIT:I keep getting battles that are 10x higher than my level but I get tasks that don't even give me exp..",Negative
"Now I am able to play it and so far its ok, I'd recommend it for everyone to try it if you like turn based rpg this wont disappoint, better to play it on pc cause it heats so much when played on the phone even with a good processor. overall a nkce game and the story is good.",Positive
"Intro and start up is very laggy and slow, gameplay runs a bit smoother. But it goes to blackscreen if you check the community page, and you gotta force stop and restart. Which is annoying as it keeps having a red dot for unread. Soundtrack is very good. Shame it is turn based tho, and not much playing at all since its mostly cutscenes.",Negative
"I can spend hours playing this game. The graphics are amazing and make you feel like you're there, and the soundtrack/music is just awesome ( better with headphones). Don't take my word for it, though, try it yourself and prepare for an addicting adventure among the stars.",Positive
"The game looked like a lot of fun and the graphic and gameplay looked awesome, however, everytime I've tried to download and play it it gets stuck on the second loading screen and I'm unable to actually play it.",Negative
"It's way exceeded my expectations so far. Inspect the trashcans and things, they have funny descriptions. Anyway I like the turn based combat and the story is amazing, I haven't been this invested in any games story in a while. I'm still getting the hang of upgrading and will try to take my time and upgrade the characters I like",Positive
"for some reason, when i try to log and enter the game, the screen would just be black but i can still click some things even though it's all black. when i also click to the character screen, the characters are in different kinds of colors and it just glitches out when i exit. please fix this, hoyoverse. it's getting annoying and i love this game so i wouldn't want to stop playing because of this, thankyou. (edit: 101323) this happened again, after the new update.",Negative
"Gameplay is much like Genshin. The storyline is well thought out and full of cult classic Easter eggs. The graphics are smooth, and the soundtrack is badass. The amount of mini games is a bit much, but gives you something to do while waiting for the next chapter to open up.",Positive
Its really fun and everything about it is amazing except when it comes to leveling up things. It feels like it takes so LONG to get the xp then materials you need just to max out 1 charactcher let alone 8.,Positive
"Newest ""game optimization"" update. Literally made EVERYTHING run WORSE. Now I have to spam tap to switch characters. Things constantly buffer to load. Multiple new glitches in the simulated universe that caused me to lose runs. I'll definitely be uninstalling and getting my money back on this if it's not addressed. I'm not paying them to actively make the game worse.",Negative
"I can feel hsr is not boring at all compare to genshin, because in this 1.2 update you actually give us a main story quest and a new place to explore while with genshin we must wait longer than in hsr in order to continue the main quest also the event in hsr is quite fun. The only drawback i experience is the limited place that we can explore but it is also okay since sometimes people to lazy to explore the map.",Positive
"Very well done. I will never look at a trashcan, dumpster, or mailbox the same again. It reminds me of a Zelda, or Castlevania, turned up to 11. The visuals are very good, story is good, protagonists pretty standard, antagonists model wise not much variation, I have yet to get more into the story. Give it a try.",Positive
"The game is pretty good and very interesting the only problem is the ""Login error occured. Please try again later."" Which is hella annoying and Its been days I haven't played it because of that error thingy keeps on popping out when I keep pn trying to play.. Please fix it for the time now I'm not playing it.",Negative

"Good graphics, decent adrenaline rush from gacha, that about it. Like every other hoyo game, not much to do in term of game play loop, spend energy > log out. U auto 99% of your content, hence no stratergy needed. Simulated uni is fun for the first hour but then get stale real fast with Abundance buff abuse. Abyss is unprogress able until u farm gear and get more character. Just another pretty gacha with lots of mini puzzel for casual, fun to look at but weak game play loop.",Negative
"After the recent update, I can't seem to even log into the game anymore the app just crashes every time I try to open it. I'm using an android and I know my system is compatible with the app but it won't load at all I don't know what to do. My previous experience with the app (during 1.0) was amazing I loved the game but now I can't even play the game anymore I really hope you'll fix it, I still want to play the game!",Negative
"So far, one of the most fair/F2P friendly gatcha systems I've seen. As of writing this comment it's the sixth limited character and I personally have two of them + a limited lightcone without spending a cent. Other than that, the voice acting is phenomenal and the story, though kinda predictable, has been really engaging. Daily quests are quick and painless but grind is to be expected with a game like this and, with the smaller maps, the lack of content between patches is very real.",Positive
"Great game, great graphics, great storyline and also great character design but the only problem was, it keeps crashing in the menu screen (where the ""Start Game"" located), and the loading screen is so laggy. Hope in the future patch will fix this.",Negative
"I love that game but since I have installed it I had an issue with a pink screen bug that I can't get rid of. Firstly I thought because the game is new and is normal to have bugs, but that bug remains since 1.2 I refer to a some designs, kill effects, party screens, and some map world issues are colored in bright pink, even normally they aren't. And because my eyes are quite sensitive to bright colors like that I cannot enjoy the gameplay. Please do something!!!!",Negative
"Coming from Genshin, the turn-based style is really refreshing and allows for less burnout in terms of both grinding and completing the story. Really smooth animations and gameplay, great game overall!",Positive
"Good but one issue is taking away from it, quite a bit, and that is I have almost no Audio in game with the one exception of the notices menu, independent cutscenes was another but the Audio for that has also stopped.",Negative
"NOT RECOMMENDED if you are FREE TO PLAY, character like 4star are really bad and only 5star will do the job. The system and function is same as Genshin impact. TOO HARD TO PLAY, when the enemy level like 37 and your lvl is 40 your character are well build but you will still lose the battle. ONCE ENEMY HIT YOU LIKE BEGINNER TRYING TO PLAY HIGH RANK MATCH.",Negative
"the game is great and everything, i would rate it a 5 star but it has so many problems, sometimes, i barely get past the loading screen, it downloads the necessary resources, but it never lets me inside, it either says error or it crashes, sometimes it even doesn't let me download the game.",Negative
"Very enjoyable,nice stories,well represented characters,likeable combats,good voice actors,splendid animations, fantastic places,wonderful and fun events, it's free,it's fun,it's just perfect thank you hoyaverse for creating another memorable and enjoyable game",Positive
"Don't get me wrong the game is fun but the amount of farming you have to do from lvl 40 and up is obsurd, not to mention some of the boss characters are so hard to beat and even if you have all your light cones and relics and traces leveled up it is still impossible to beat them (Kafka for example) I tried fighting her 8 times and all of my characters are leveled up all the way and I still can not beat her. And there isn't a option to revive downed charecters which I think is an AWFUL idea.",Negative
"Lots of fun. Sadly the game force logs you out, then pretends no resources have been downloaded. Then it forces you to set there and download another 7.5GB of redundant data. I don't need the resources twice it's a massive waste of space. Uninstalled!",Negative
Love the art and the controls are great. Things become less fun as time goes on though... The forced unskippble dialog and forced choices becomes monotonous and eventually tedious to the point where you quit and play something else that values your time.,Negative
"Love the game, the music, the art, the characters, the game play is just all amazing. I'd say better then genshin impact but that's my opinion. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I wish we could jump and glide but still an amazing game, I'd played it for 4 hours now and my eyes hurt.",Positive
"A fun game with a well told story. Can be a bit overwhelming with complicated systems and side missions, and the gacha is incredibly poor. Has the foundation to be a great game with some simplification/polish.",Positive
"I gave it one star like many others for the reason that i can't download the resources. Everytime i try to download it, the game crashes and sends me back to my home screen. The wait time for the opening is also to long and for the resources my phone have more than enough space to download it but it crashes down. Might change my review when the issue get fix.",Negative
"Animation, amazing character, and great storyline if you completely every you get around 300+ wishes only jades that doesn't even counts the level rewards and all the events. Pity system are way better then genshin. Over all a great game",Positive
I only play this on PC. I've enjoyed the story and the turned based combat system so far. Some dialogue are unskippable though and needs feels like it needs a bit of a smoother transition/loading.,Positive
"This game is amazing! As a mobile player, this game's graphics are super good and fun to see, unlike other games! The only issue is that it lags sometimes and will restart your game, but what else would you expect on mobileü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Great game so far though!",Positive
"It's a solid game, not that difficult to understand the tutorial. It's f2p friendly, and the game play is easier than genshin but LigthCone (basically like weapon in Genshin) is harder to get. Can we get other easier way to get a 4star LigthCone(weapon) ? After all, thanks for making this type of ""Adventure Gacha game"" thanks Hoyo~ :) <3 ( Edit : Can we get a Silver Wolf Rerun??? )",Positive
"Thanks Mihoyo for another good game. Pros: excelent visual, good game play, fun story, good quest and puzzle. Cons: some npc voiceline (english) is not good and cause annoying, a bit laggy. Hope can receive more Special Star Rail Pass.",Positive
"I'm kinda confused 5 minutes into the game. The story develops a bit too slowly. Like you're thrown into a huge space station with some bad guys attacking but you don't know who or why. Great graphics and music and amazing ultimate energy animation. But battery draining too fast, I use Note 10.",Positive
Best turn-based game I've played in a long while. Interesting fusion of Honkai's exploration system and Genshin's gacha/upgrade system. The combat mechanics are layered and satisfying. Check every Trash Can.,Positive
"As a turn based game fans, I'm having fun so far, it's so addictive. Edit: After few months of playing, I am still liking it. The daily quest is fast and easy, which doesn't even take you 5 minutes to complete it. It's really friendly for working adults.",Positive
"The character designs are gorgeous, the story seems really interesting, and the graphics are pretty decent considering the game just launched and man it's like a breath of fresh air from genshin, the RPG concept remains the same yet the story plot makes the entire experience so different!",Positive
"Kinda disappointed. Got the graphics and character design but the combat ruin it. Should have make it like Genshin combat rather than a turn based combat game. What's more disappointing is the fact there is lesser freedom when exploring the open world in this game (can't jump, climb, or use gadgets). I know this isn't Genshin but Imma be honest Genshin have raise the standard for me and this game doesn't met it. Only graphics hype it up for me.",Negative
"A very well made gacha game. Turn based combat with deep RPG systems. I wouldn't necessarily say it's free to play friendly, but if you spend your currency(stellar jades) and energy(trailblaze power) wisely you can complete all the end game content. Overall it's a really fun game to play.",Positive
I've only gotten about 4 hours of playing but it's amazing it's graphics and the way its battles work are amazing I used play genshin impact but this is simalur so I knew part of the controls I love it so far the story and everything it's fun and much better then genshin impact and if you don't know what genshin impact is it was made by same people who made this masterpiece but I dislike auto battle because I want save my ultimate ability and the charecter looks amazing and ultimate attacks epic,Positive
"Genshin was a really good game, but not so much for me on mobile, with it's open world movement and action combat. Star Rail, on the other hand, is like if everything good about Genshin was made more accessible for bite size and mobile play, without losing charm or strategic depth.",Positive
"May not be for everyone since no open world and turn based combat. But the character interactions, story, and music are on point. Not to mention, the game runs butter smooth even on mobiles. Must check out if you're a fan of turn based combat.",Positive
"Surprisingly, A Good Game even without the gacha! I have played dozens and dozens of Gacha games and admittedly Star Rail isn't the first or only Turned Based Gacha game out there but Hoyoverse definitely gave their own twist to it, visuals are on point even exceeding their Previous hit Genshin, music is good but could use some more variety, Gameplay is compelling and simple to learn but hard to master, but the Story, the Story is the make or break of this game and it's excellent.",Positive
It did take a very long time to get all that e stuff downloaded but also if I leave the app for 30 seconds it closes and restarts which is annoying and the joystick is slightly annoying and confusing to use but it's otherwise a great game,Negative
"Probably the best launch version of a turn-based Gacha game to date. Good story, good combat, good music, good graphics, and ACTUALLY good free characters that are given. Gacha rates suck for now, but hopefully it improves a bit in the future when more chars and light comes are introduced. Very F2P friendly as well, which is extremely important. This game will become the Gacha Masterpiece if the updates come correct in the future. Thank you for showing passion in the development in this game.",Positive
"The graphic is great, story is excellent, designs solid. But you're wasting too much time walking around talking to people that playing this game feels more like watching an anime more than anything else, and battle wise it's simple compared to other strategy turn based combat that makes me feel very tired",Negative
"This game has very good visuals and voice acting. Beautiful character designs and a fairly large map. It has quite a bit of storage from Genshin, which means my phone can still play Honkai: Star Rail. With so many rewards, it makes me even more comfortable playing Honkai: Star Rail, especially with 5* characters for free, 'Dr. Ratio'. My advice, give good relic statistics more often. I'm sick of getting def% relic. That's all, overall good.",Positive
"It was fun until it logged out automatically n deleted all my progress although i logged in back with the same account tht i used to sign in for the 1st time,so maybe will jz uninstall the game, cause feel lazy n annoying if this keeps going on each time it will automatically logged out n when i re-login the progress will be deleted,very disappointed since I've ardy gone quiet far from the story line n the character n item i get all gone in a blink of an eye..",Negative
"i love the game, i like the new take on combat mechanics rather than the usual one from genshin and honkai and i like how explorative all the while being a turn based game as that's usually not seen alot. the graphics are nice and the controls are nice too.",Positive
One star for annoying RNG on relic upgrades. This kind of systems brings more disappointment than fun. As if the entire upgrade was meant to annoy you. I spent on upgrades but not even a single upgrade went to crit value. This game will not meet it's end because they copy the same system from Genshin. The relic part is the most disappointing even when you have the ages if your not lucky you're doomed. Why not give us craft system and give every player the liberty to upgrade a specific stat.,Negative
"I would like to give it 2 stars I do like the graphics, characters, and story. But the resources grind and pull rates make the game unplayable and I dropped out at level 46 because there was just nothing to look forward to. With such a basic combat system you would expect a more fleshed out set of characters(>2 healers) but they try to impress you with the bare minimum in all aspects of gameplay, characters only have 1 skill and a burst. I will look for more satisfying and rewarding games.",Negative
"Looks really promising. I'll change the review as the game comes out, but im very impressed with music and visuals Edit 1: So it is pretty fun as far as gameplay goes, but there have been problems launching the game sometimes or even logging in at all. The game also crashes every once in a while as of the latest update.",Positive
"The game is good at any perspective. The turn base system is excelent, the visual effect, character design, story, animation, sound track. Its just perfect, the most liked things in my opinion is the combat system, the turn based system is making it more easier than Hoyoverse's other games, you can actually playing it with a lot of ease, you can play it while you're working, studying maybe? After all this game is just perfect!",Positive
"Amazing game, definitely an improvement than what genshin was. Gameplay is turn-based, fixed the gacha summon rates, better than genshins. Only issue is how much lag spike and frame rate drops I get. I just wish I had someone recommend me the best settings for graphics on the s21 ultra phone.",Positive
"It's relatively fun right now but the grind needed to get stronger and to save stellar jades is very hectic and long. You need quite the time needed which I don't really have. Nevertheless, the story, the gameplay, and the animations are very good and I'm hoping to see improvements in the future. Godspeed Hoyoverse!",Positive
"Great game, was getting bored of the button mashing combat so this change of combat is very fun, story is quite engaging, character designs and skillsets are great and animations are beautiful. Would definitely recommend anyone to give it a shot üëç",Positive
"I really wish they would've stuck to the open combat system, the turn based combat feels really constricting. The only redeemable part is the graphics like all hoyoverse games. I loved genshin, and played a good part of Honkai impact. It felt free. This game feels really slow with the combat style.",Negative
I've waited a whole month for this game to release and for nothing. i was downloading the data but then it crashed in the middle of downloading. It also crashes when it was verifying resources. also i was in the story when i crashed (?) because i can't click anything but I wasn't lagging or anything.I also keep getting login error when I tried to play the game. I was so excited to play it but ended up getting these kind of stuffs happening. But ofc this game just release so there'll be some bugs,Negative
"Really basic combat system, people have one move and an element and that's it. No items in battle, no tactics in battle, you slap face and that's it. Draw rates are absolutely terrible, doesn't feel good. Gave it about 10 hours over a couple of days and then dropped it.",Negative
"F2P friendly. As long as you have decent processing power on your phone, you wont have crashes. Ive not had one performance problem. If you do, adjust your settings to lower than High, which is where it starts out.",Positive
"Smooth, quick loading, beautiful skill animations, and great music with a fun story and interesting character interactions. Probably one of may favorites. Ignore the low reviews, those are people who don't read and can't tell the difference between PRE-download and launch date.",Positive
"Honestly it's just a bigger dungeon crawler game, not a true open world or exploration game. The mechanics of exploring feels too cheap compared to other games. Most reviews here are just happy to play the game after so much hype, but I honestly expected more from gameplay. The tutorial and gameplay itself drags on too long, and same issue of no skip button. For these reasons I'll skip this game, quite a disappointment",Negative
"The game scores highly in graphics, story and gameplay. My ONLY problem is the gacha. It's brutal for those that decide to stay with the game. Something feels wrong in a turn based RPG with fire characters to put in time to amass 75+ pulls just to have a 50% at acquiring them. Kills my motivation to keep playing especially if I fail and can't get more trys through gameplay before the limited banner ends. I'm all for supporting but to pressure me to spend $$$ for a TBRPG? F*** you, respectfully.",Positive
"I like the game it has a good interesting story the characters are well designed, my only problem is when I try to change the graphics into medium everything in the worlds started to be white, I tried to leave and come back but it wouldn't go üòî, so is there any way to fix this problem?",Negative
"The game is good, story good, mechanic good, but as a turn based combat game, it missing something and theres a sound bug during a major cutscene. The sound will get stuttering during cutscene. And there should also be a victory animation with details about characters performance in the battle",Negative
"More of a story than anything else. So many cut scenes and talking sequences when I just wanted to play the game. 3 hours in, maybe had 8 actual battles. The rest is running around a map, talking to NPC's, and more cut scenes. It might be nice for some, but for me, I'm not a fan. The artwork is beautiful, and the actual gameplay is smooth, and I liked the mechanics. It just has way too much talking.",Negative
"Let's get this outta the way first-- this game is NOT Genshin. If you came here expecting it to be a sci-fi twist on Genshin, you've obviously done zero research on this game. Ok cool. Got that settled. Overall I'm pretty happy with this game. I'm always lukewarm on turn-based combat, but it works well enough here. What i really love are the characters and the music. Story's interesting so far, but it's really the former two that's caught my attention.",Positive
"It was fun at first and still is kinda fun. The combat is very bland. There is very little you have to think about, not much strategy or really anything unique about it. The animations are beautiful but get annoying the 100th time you've heard them. The balance of the enemies is rough. Some are very very tanky while others are an insane one shot. I hope they add more depth to the combat. Character designs are meh compared to genshin. Most of the games design is a clone of genshin. 3/5 stars.",Negative
"Lovely game, you can tell a lot went into it. The character interactions are great, the writing has improved a lot. The combat is simple and turn based Nothing crazy but very fun and engaging. Rates are horrible as expected",Positive
Very fun and immersive story and world. Love the designs and art style. The grind is a little too under rewarding tho. Lving up and such also feels too overwhelming with little resources. Hope to see the game get improved bc I'm enjoying my time so far.,Positive
"I liked its turn base aspect but i think its lacking on open world exploration, i would like it if there was some sort of open world area where you can actually climb things, i also like the fact that there are multiple easter eggs and funny dialogs (if you actually read them and didnt download this game to spoil your gambling addiction)",Positive
"Absolutely well done. The gameplay, the characters, the world, and especially the dialogue choice and the world interactions (especially the meme easter eggs) makes the game more enjoyable than what I thought it would be. Hats off to Hoyoverse for once again delivering such a well crafted game.",Positive
"So far, this gamr has been pretty fun, but I do have some complaints. First of all, the game is constantly having frame drops. However, this is mostly the fault of my hardware. The main problem I've noticed is that it constantly crashes. And while you could see it as also part of my hardware, it often happens in not very hardware intensive parts of game play. For example, many of my crashes have been from not waiting long enough to stop running before I start a conversation.",Negative
"This game would be fantastic if I could play through one run of Simulated Universe without my phone heating up like crazy. And for some reason, it vibrates randomly during gameplay, specifically with this game. Restarting my phone does NOT fix the issue. How am I supposed to beat Cocolia if my game crashes mid fight?!",Negative
So far the game has been very solid. It's goofy as hell and I'm totally okay with it. Just stared at a trash can until it gave me an item and scared room service off by jumping out of a closet. The turn based combat is good and being able to use ultimates out of turn opens up some interesting strategies,Positive
"Unable To Play - keeps crashing and closing. My phone can play Genshin, and other heavy duty games just fine. But for some reason this game won't do. Randomly in the middle of running or changing characters - it will just close. And I have to restart it all over again. It's worse when I ambush a monster, but then it crashes, so when I come back. I am ambushed instead. Game is lovely nonetheless, but it's not mobile optimized it seems. Even some moving controls are... Wonky.",Negative
"Get to a certain point in the game and everything becomes too difficult to complete. Pay 2 win. No wonder they're desperately trying to re-recruit players that left. Fix your game first. An abysmal experience after you invest so much time, just to hit a wall of impassable difficulty. Annoying, frustrating, and too much left to chance. I'm glad I never spent money on this lousy game.",Negative
"Having a lot of fun right now. I love turned based rpg, and the character building system is really similar to Genshin, so it's really easy to understand. The characters interactions are some of my favourites and the humor is great. Keep up the great work!",Positive
"Everything was good until recent update, the game interface become relatively slow when changing screen, black out and sometimes freeze and now i got error and can't login the game anymore. Force my hand to uninstall. Thanks",Negative
"Best game I've played in many years. Absolutely amazing. A beautifully balanced battle system with a solid emersive storyline, simple navigation, interesting characters, smooth controls and great graphics. Most importantly it's fun. Such a great game. Truly a work of art. If I had to sum it up in one sentence I'd say: Honkai: Star Rail is the perfect balance of complexity and simplicity. 10 stars",Positive
"I love this game, from the story to OST's to characters design etc However, i was really excited for the new update but i can't login anymore, I've tried around 9 times but it still gives me login error 1001_3, my wifi is totally fine and my phone could handle the game before the update I hope this issue will be patched soonüôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",Positive
"I'll give 3 star for now. I badly wanna play the game but im stuck at the log in screen. It said global distribution error. Is it because the game is new so the server is overloaded with active players? Pls fix it immediately, i really wanna start playing with my Himeko! edit: i really do hope you do something with the log in errors. My net is stable but im still stuck in the log in screen.",Negative
"I love it, the story, the art, the character, the gacha system (is rewarding), and also the turn based system is like final fantasy series (you need to break). Since global launch, I have never stopped playing (if i have time). In my honest opinion, people who are giving bad reviews are people who have low end phone (there is a PC version guys), also there are people who thinks this should be 100% the same as Genshin (while the trailer showed that this is a turn-based game). Wake up guys.",Positive
"The design of the environments and characters is well done, but besides that, it seems to be lacking. The turn-based mechanics are pretty simplistic to the point of repetitiveness. The lore is confusing and not well explained - I don't know if prior knowledge from other Honkai games is needed, but many lore concepts are simply thrown at you without any (or little) explanation. Aeons, Stellarons, whatever the Legion is, ect, are all glossed over. The databank is similarly vague.",Negative
"The gameplay is good,but... I can't play the game. There's a log in error on my screen everytime I want to play.Also the cutscenes lag and the music is distorted which isn't that fun. But fix the log in error,Please. I'll change my review.FIX IT. I CANT PLAY IT.",Negative
"I looked forward to this game so much, only to be disappointed. First, it start with turn based combat, that was the first strike for me, but I still decided to continue. Then I unlocked wish, only to see it had the same low rate as genshin impact did. To be fair though, with enough skill in genshin, you can play with nearly every character, but skill barely matter in a turn based game. So the horrible rate of wish is a huge detriment. Basically, this is a low quality sci-fi genshin impact.",Negative
"Best thing I've played in a long long time. Amazing story and easy to follow. Only problem is after ""xianzhou"" World there is nothing to do and also there's no more missions so I don't know what to do anymore:( sadly I think I'll have to put the game to rest after levelling up kost champs to 60 :(",Positive
"This exactly looks like Genshin impact, except the gameplay. The characters are good, the story is good and the animation and designs are awesome. The gameplay is somewhat boring but it is still good. Overall, I liked the game very much.",Positive
"I really like the game! Very nice graphics. I have a less expensive phone (midrange), but the game still runs very well with high graphics settings! I'm impressed by it running so well on comparatively cheap phone!",Positive
"Best in overall! Gameplay, graphics, style, animation, stories, voice act, everything...i don't know if it's just my phone that always lag at the loading screen and sometimes even crash but i hope you can fix this",Positive
"Great story, Great game overall. Honestly, as far as the game and the characters goes there's not much to say other than it's amazing. Only issue I have is that on the gacha page there's no way to see how close you are to pity when you pull for a character. Either a slight oversight or predatory practise.",Positive
"Truly amazing. Im totally speechless at what Hoyoverse did to this game. The incredible graphics is breathtaking and stunning, as well as the storyline that has many twists and turns, the well-developed characters with lots of motional expression and the jokes(those make me chuckle). Hoping to see more in the future!",Positive
Very hyped about it at first! After playing for two versions it got like rlly boring Then I stopped playing for a few months The game doesn't have the thing to make me feel motivated to play it again I love the characters and stuff and the whole place but the gameplay is just ... I'm a big hoyoverse fan but HSR is just not for me I guess I've got great luck in this game unlike genshin which kinda continues to boost me in playing for a few more months Stopped after playing for 2 months ü•≤,Positive
Fun game! The story is interesting and the characters' attitudes are entertaining. Its mechanics are easy to understand and you can more or less clear the game without whaling although it would take some time to build up your characters. Great work!,Positive
"Entered the game and my account had desappeared, I was very disappointed, they were able to retrieve my account, but It's information is now all messed up... Not to mention all the progression I missed because of their error.",Negative
Pretty good. But id say... If ur gonna make it turn based anyways... Then why not make multiple skill options with battle invintory items and shiz? What Most people like about turn base battles are the thinking that goes into it and the planning in hard battles. But here its just 2 atk types for 1 person.. It makes you wanna enjoy it as a Full on turn based rpg but falls short when you actually do.,Positive
"This game had a lot of potential. I understand what they were going for, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Autobattle should be removed, make the battles more meaningful instead of having to 'skip' them with autobattles. Implement jumping and world exploration, complete with rewards.",Positive
"Characters are really good, love how their paths tell you what their role in battle is. All the details and work they put into it can really be noticed everywhere, the story so far is very interesting and the animations are over the top. Gacha system is good and as someone who usually pulls in standard banner, I love how you can pick a free 5* when you get to 300 wishes, I'm at 152, almost there :'D. I hope to see it grow even more in the future. Thank you for this amazing game :)",Positive
"Unfortunately, the game is heavy, I can barely run it in the lowest graphics possible, I might quit this game sooner if my phone can't keep up with it anymore. Hoping for some splendid optimization in the future, Ive been waiting for this game ever since the very first CBT/Trailer, it'd be a shame if I just uninstall it after patiently waiting for the game to release..",Positive
"The things this game has going for it is that it has a great story and excellent characters. The combat is just trash though. It's a 4 v enemy turn based battler, but they have the same system as gheshen for summoning, and the number of characters available are miniscule. This leads to a combo team game that has no combos. It takes everything about a turn based game that is fun and just removes it.",Negative
"I came from playing Cookie Run: Kingdom and give this game a chance to try it out. Turns out I fell in love with this game. It's a whole new experience for me. Well, there are aspect of the game that is a bit similar to CRK but overall it is very different. The story itself is very interesting and I love the voice acting of the characters. My fav character is Pom-pom the cute train conductor. Love this game!!",Positive
"Its like playing a premium turn based JRPG from a console. Story makes you want to play more, Boss fights are epic and character interactions are relatable. Gameplay? Battle mechanics are easy to learn and smoothly done Graphics by mobile standards is superb VOs and theme music are very good. Everything is looking great.",Positive
"Great turn-based game! I love the anime style design and gameplay is very smooth and action packed for a turn-based game. Story is detailed and lots of content to play, also rewards is generous enough to get strong characters early in the game. Just hoping for more end-game contents to play with.",Positive
"Pretty lame overall. Finished the ""story"" and made it through all the world's in a week without spending a dime. Story cutscenes look like they were made 10 years ago, only 1 character moves at a time. The gacha system is terrible, and the requirements to level up characters only gets exponentially more expensive and tedious with a lack of fun game modes. 2 stars cause they have cool animations.",Negative
"Honestly not even a question for me. Out of all the trashy mobile games you find this doesn't even compare. Sure there's predatory Gacha and a limit of how much you can progress per day, but that's not nearly enough to put it on the same level as other games. This is a free triple A title which is also F2P friendly. And it's a good game in itself as well. Just try it out, no reason not to.",Positive
"Great game so far, excited to see where it goes. I hope they continue to update and improve the combat system especially, as there is a lot more potential for it. The characters are lovely, and the main character has their own personality you can curate through the interactions around you. The references and humor throughout are also very well done.",Positive
"The graphics on this game is actually pretty nice and the story quest are awesome, and the play style of all the characters really suits them. There was no problem of of this game when I play and I like how you can roam around every map and collect chest and fight monsters/bosses 5 star rating, i love it!!",Positive
"Stil have problem when can get cut off in loading screen especially when using data. But so far no problem when inside the game. I hope in furure have bookmark method to continue if suddenly get cut off during the boss with 3 phases. Example, if get cut off in phase 2 we can continue at phase 2",Positive
I love the game! I think it's really fun. The story is great although it is still not finished but nonetheless it's very immersive. The characters' design and graphics are also great! I love the combat style of this game! Definitely going to wait for further updates in terms of the story.,Positive
"Great mix of sci-fi and fantasy with an interesting set of turn-based combat mechanics. The character designs and story are beautiful and the game is very generous with rewards, I hope the devs continue what they're doing.",Positive
"It's a great game, I enjoy playing it. However The only issue I'd say I have about this game ( if I'm not the only one with this issue) would have to be how world three is super laggy with graphics When you angle the camera certain ways. Please fix issue.",Positive
"I absolutely love the music in this game! If you're hesitant to play, play it for the music, the amazingly animated action, the superb voice acting, and the countless references to games & shows you might know. I love how character dialogue is more open and free; I feel like I have options, I can be rude and selfish or caring and selfless in the way I talk to npcs. I'm playing honkai Star Rail more than I play genshin Impact or my other games, and I'm happy I decided to join early.",Positive
"Combat system is a lot more fast paced and ultimate-spammy than I originally thought. Having break not outright cancel an enemy's turn (unlike trails) and instead just slowing them down and deal damage is a great decision. Plot is pretty decent tbh, especially the sidequests. 1 star off b/c Gacha system is ehh as usual for mihoyo",Positive
It's alright... The graphics are great but the turn based combat really takes away from the free roam.... The currency you buy is pointless.. also the fact that you don't get to pick your weapon or style is also a negative for me..,Negative
"Terrific game on the phone and pc. It does cause some screen heat and DRAINS the battery, but all the gameplay it awesome. For someone who remembers when FF7 first came out, this game pulls me in with the turn based combat and mind-blowing characters. Keep it up, Hoyo.",Positive
"The game is really nice, lovely character designs and the graphics are still good despite my storage is 98% occupied, fun gameplay and quests. I just got bored of it somehow, since turn based gameplay aren't that much of a fun thing for me, but I'll admit it was good playing in HSR. Keep it up<33",Positive
"Amazing characters and quality and detail, this might be even better then gunship! To be honest I love where the story is going, but four star, you know why? It's because it kinda takes storage and when you had to fight the dragon, it was very hard and it took me 5 tries. (MY OPINION)",Positive
Really exceptional gameplay and story. This is the first time I like to invest in. This game does not pressure you in spending money. I actually put some money into the game because I want to. Not because I need to. Good job! Please give us more content and more characters. Maybe another new ultimate skill?,Positive
"The game is awesome, but I have a lot of trouble with getting to play it. I have to swich mobile data for wifi when the first loading screen with Pom Pom shows if I want to play on wifi. If I try to load the game without using mobile data, it shows me either error 1001_3 or 1001_4. That's how it was yesterday, today I can't seem to get it to go to the first loading screen with Pom Pom even with mobile data, though yesterday it worked really well",Negative
"The game is force closing every time I open the app. Screen gets stuck for a couple of seconds when applying patch, then the app closes immediately. Uninstalling is a last resort due to the size of the game, so I would like to find a fix for this problem",Negative
"I really love this games, it's so addicted, I even can't stop üòÖ I just play this about 2 weeks and already finished all the mission (even the extra one üòÖ) that exist, so now I'm waiting don't know when there's gonna be, but for now I just trying to upgrade my character to the max. So you read this and haven't played this. Try it. It's really fun to play. Ah although I advised you better play this with a stable Internet connection coz so far it's kinda hard to log in without it, enjoy üëç",Positive
"Turn based, and it's fun. It's a bit grindy once you reach higher levels and it's also gacha which isn't great. Its fairly friendly to F2P though and the world feels immersive and alive. The dubs in each language are done well. Can get a bit tiring to read dialogue but the combat looks incredible and story is ok so far.",Positive
"4* for all aspects of the game. Great art,music and character design. The 2nd big bosses music is amazing. The f2p rewards are decent, but falls off once caught up in the story. Extra star for The ""phoenix"" from a certain 4* characters ultimate.",Positive
"Easy to farm cause got auto play, graphic, gameplay, animation are a good and task are not headache to be solved. I like it. At first a bit sceptical because of turn based type games but after try, practice, learn and understand more of it, it nice actually. Try it, and be patience, take time a bit, enjoy.",Positive
"I was excited to play this game but unfortunately i can't even enter this game because of login error .I hope you can fix it as soon as possible.Luckily i also download it on pc so i got to experience the gameplay and i really love it.The character,story and combat is very amazing.",Positive
"You need a device with good/newer specs in order to play this game. I didn't experience any problems while exploring but my device began to crash and restart, once I needed to fight in the tutorial. It crashed and shut down whenever I triggered a cutscene or used a character's ultimate move. I play their other games, HI3, TOT, & GI and despite their bigger size and two of them having cutscenes also, I've never experienced them crash before. I wanted to play this but it's not working for me :(",Negative
As someone who uses DEX or Scrpy to stream it to my PC kind of disappointing that MKB and or Controller are non functional... Heck i find it impressive we're still limiting control schemes in this day and age..... Yes I Know there's a PC client Yes I know I can just download it. But still.... It's disappointing... since game is made in Unity and the bindings exist...,Negative
PC version always crash on story mode battle transition screen which kind of weird since I played genshin on normal to high settings and it's just not me. So in short I have to play HSR on my phone just to pass that crash issue and play back to pc after that which is too much hassle. Lastly why we have to wait for the fix at 1.1 patch instead of this month that's a month worth of event skip. This is a serious bug. Giving 3 until you fix this.,Negative
"This game is really fun and I do greatly enjoy it but it would have been better as it's own game and not part of the honkai series. I was really looking forward to a sequel game for honkai impact 3rd but seeing as how they basically retconned all the characters and the only similarity to hi3 being the characters, that's definitely not happening. If it was it's own standalone game it would be perfect but it really doesn't feel like a game from the honkai series.",Positive
"Honkai: Star Rail has beautiful graphics but falls short in story and gameplay depth. The turn-based combat feels repetitive, and the gacha system is expensive. Potential exists, but improvements are needed for a more engaging experience.",Negative
"I like this game a lot, Its fun and you can explore too, but not as much. I find it enjoyable since I like fighting games, and this one is just as right. And the characters, scenery, stories are so good! The quality is really nice too, im super invested at the story honestly.",Positive
"Game is good, like the Anime characters. So far different from Genshin Impact interms of gameplay its mixture of genshin and final fantasy. I did run into some issue on cutscene where frame rate drops heavily and audio was shuttering on my device don't know any other have same issue.",Positive
"Pretty good game, it would be best to try the game for yourself, the graphics and animation is amazing, the combat is really fun although the rewards aren't the best to say the least, the story, lore, combat, animation and the fun you will have playing this game will make your time worth it.",Positive
"The game is nice. It has great graphics, great characters, and storyline, but the problem is that during combat, you can't move freely like in genshin and other games All in all, it is great",Positive
"The game is not fully optimized yet. Everything is lag, the title screen, cutscenes, in-game (even though I set my overall graphics into lowest as possible. Looking forward for an optimization in the future.",Negative
"It plays too similar to Genshin Impact (except for the turn by turn system). Not surprised there since they are from the same Dev. This is my personal non bias take: There are just too many games using the same engine and I concluded that laziness plays a huge role in it. This game is most certainly not bad but it's not my cup of tea. Or should I say, not my vial of potion.",Negative
"Its horrible, basically reskinned genshin but become turnbased, also steal hi3 asset and reused again. Tutorial is very long, i already get bored first, story cant be skip also, not everyone have time to read the story, and too simple combat, you only got 3 move, normal attack, charge attack and ultimate. This is basically downgrade genshin in many ways, dont play it. It waste of time",Negative
"When I first heard of how the combat worked, it seemed really shallow. I have come to be proven wrong. And for the other aspects of the game, overall very good, and even if not perfect, good enough to warrant 5*. Feels like a good a** game first and foremost, that can also be played more as a gacha, but not necessarily.",Positive
"Basically, fantastic The game itself doesn't feel clunky which is rare in the turn based genre,the rewards are pretty generous which made the players like myself keeps looking forward to each time. I have 0 issue towards the game as it was now since nothing really stands out",Positive
Good game but boring after you get to the end plus pulling gold never get even blade you cant get wont pull. so 1 gold rest purple.and theres way 2 much talking that you cant skip other then that it's ok. If I had of pulled more gold with over 100 pulls I did then I would give more stars but it's fixed on gold pulls. Boss enemy gets more turns so fixed,Negative
As turn based rpg fans I love how they try to innovate their franchise in this direction. I know this is just the beginning and they need a lot of improvement on their combat depth and variety of battle mode. But I appreciate their direction in this way.,Positive
"Hello Devs, I come up with new problem, that is connection. I use our local internet provider named iconnect. The internet speed is fairly fast. But I often fail to log in the game it asks for reboot. I accessed YouTube, hoyoverse website and logging in other game just fine. Please figure this out, what's wrong with the game. Thank you",Negative
"Started this game on it's second day of its release. It still has some problems, but quality life changes applies every new patch, and endgame content is pretty decent. Rewards are actually quite good, like getting a free 5* limited on our mail was insane. Also the game is quite rewarding at in-game too.It's f2p friendly. It's not hard to farm, you get free 10 wishes by logging in every patch etc..The game really cares about its community and hey, that's what I actually want.",Positive
Lots of people dislike this game bcz they said that it feels like they're just sitting there while playing without doing anything it but I think it's still fun and challenging because that's not true! I love this kind of gameplay more tbh.. Maybe because I played a lot of this kind of game mode but it's still challenging for me!,Positive
"i love the game but its crashing a lot lately and a majority of the assets/background arent loading in, its gotten to the point where i cant play it without feeling nauseas from exploring the areas. this problem has been going on for a while, please fix it soon üôè",Positive
"I'd like to report a bug, ever since after the update i noticed glitchy like noise around the space station, I didn't mind it at first because i thought it was a new feature, then i did some tasks and went to xianzou loufu and went around the area for a bit then there was a beam like a blue beam across the screen then i used the attack button then the environment went all buggy, the texture changed, the walls started disappearing and the floor turned red. I hope this bug will be fixed.",Positive
"Good game so far, but the story needs work. Engrish at times, failed translations, and other parts just feeling... poorly executed. It has potential but so far it feels like it's half-hearted execution will hold it back.",Positive
"The turn-based combat is well done, it's exciting and might be interesting even for action-lovers. The menus and RPG systems are basically copied from Genshin. The huge downside here is that the story seems to be important, but is delivered through absolutely annoying characters - from presumptuous ""heroes"", through dull filler sidekicks, to squeaking 12 y.o. girls dressed up to stimulate pedophilic dreams. And thus, I've ended up skipping all the dialogue, 'cause it's unbearable.",Positive
"It has a great concept,great animation,great design the game itself isn't the problem it's just unplayable when I try to play it the game just completely restarts my phone whenever there's a cutscene or there is dialouge I am on Android and I am not sure why it does this please fix this bug as soon as you guys can because it's literally unplayable at this point",Negative
"Can somebody tell me what happend? After i download the data, it can't let me in, it said ""Login failed try next time again later"" after i trying to login the 7th the game still said that again. I tried to delete the game and download it again, what happen? It's still the same thing, my friend said it because my wifi, but my wifi is nice (ive try it with mobile data and it won't work). Please tell me what happend HOYOVERSE.",Negative
"I absolutely don't understand the negative reviews. I am not the biggest fan of Genshin, and even I can say that this game is great. It is very optimized, like REALLY. The storytelling is not peak fiction, but is very fun for a game, even more for a f2p one. The animations are peak of the genre. It reminds me a lot of persona 5 in a sense. I would say it's the highest of Mihoyo so far.",Positive
"Very Intriguing story, the game offers quite the combat system, very reminiscent of its predecessor honkai impact, the game also most certainly have genshin inspired animations and system. Overall the game starts quite bland, but as u progress it's more and more fun.",Positive
"I can't enjoy the game when I have to constantly close and open the game cause it just locks you at the login screen for some reason, then if I'm lucky enough to bypass that then I gotta worry about certain menus freezing up. I'll just wait for the ps5 release.",Negative
"I'm giving it a one star for now. This game has been infuriating to play. I've been having an audio issue in which I can't hear the game at all, and I know for a fact that it's not my phone. I've tried restarting, reinstalling, deleting data....nothing works. Also, the game has completely crashed my phone multiple times already. Like, full on frozen and shutting down. Idk what these 5 star reviewers are smoking but don't believe them.",Negative
"I like the game visually and but hate it because it's soo empty after completing everything. Really need more fun and challenging stuff to do like PvP or anything that involves socialising. Overall I like the game. I hope the VA and character designs won't change, unlike genshin where they keep changing VA and character designs.",Positive
"Great music, great graphics, I'm enjoying the game so far. Although I read some reviews mostly having performance issue. Probably if you're not using a decent device you will having those problems, you can expect that and probably dev can do more optimization for this issue.",Positive
"It is pretty good for turned based game. Love the aesthetic and character design as well. In terms of mechanic, it very similar to genshin i dont have to learn it from scratch. I'm hoping that this would be available on switch as well.",Positive
"Didn't really know anything about the game and pre-registered because it's made by Hoyoverse and I play Genshin Impact. Easily one of the best decisions I've ever made. I won't say much more besides everything is awesome and it feels close in quality to a great console or PC jrpg. It may have its flaws and they'll likely become more apparent as the initial content is cleared but honestly? I don't care it's truly been such an awesome experience so far and I look forward to the rest, amazing start",Positive
I really like the game but I don't like how it keeps on stuttering and the fps drops on my experience after 30-50 mins of gameplay. I love the story and game mechanics n all but I can't play properly with the fps keeps on dropping for my game. Pls fix the issue ASAP for the same players who are also experiencing this,Negative
"Fans of the turn-based days of Final Fantasy, rejoice! This game is like PS1-PS2 era Final Fantasy! You can run around maps. The way the camera is in battle makes it feel more like a nod to Final Fantasy than something such as Raid. Here's my major complaint so far... MiHoyo, please get over your despute with Android players! You still haven't given us controller support for Genshin, and we have no controller support for this! This is another game that would feel way better with a controller!",Negative
"Fun game, good rpg and strategy elements, but the pity system being at 90 is too expensive when taking into consideration just how many characters you NEED to have built for content. It's not like Genshin where you can get by with one maxed out character, so I wouldn't really recommend.",Negative
"The game is fun, yes it is. The character designs are just gorgeous, yes it is. But the main problem is that, the game keeps crashing and when I change the quality, the game just turns all white. Please fix this.",Negative
"As always, Hoyoverse delivers the best game. I'm addicted to the game. Didn't know turn-based combat could be so much fun. The only thing I hope Hoyoverse could improve is just the energy stuff but that's just me because I don't want to stop playing. Love all the character, music and even the story which is surprising because I never care much about stories in game.",Positive
"Update edit: Okay forget what I said about turn based gameplay because man! the world building, THE MUSIC(S), the voice acting and characterisation, the self aware and naturally flowing scripts + little fun poking at pop culture references, all within a free game?? Hoyoverse you truly did an amazing job here. Well done. Even the leveling up experience has drastically improved compared to Genshin. I will continue to savour all the lore crumbs because I am hooked into this world.",Positive
Downloaded on wifi so i can play during long waits and downtime while outside. Extreme data usage just to play. It seems the game uploads constantly. I've gone through 2gb mobile data just playing for a little less than a week.,Negative
Great game to play. The great storyline and beautiful graphics. All around a good game to play if you like open-world games. Is the story gonna continue on Xianzhou Luofu? I'm at the point of the story where I've got nothing to do but gather resources for my heroes to level them up.,Positive
"I tried to play this game a few days ago. However, there are frequent crashes while downloading and when I did the ""Tap to start"" it was showing login error. Code : 1001_3 . Today I tried play the game , same thing. I did the method of restarting the device. That didn't work. Then it finally worked but I had to go somewhere. When I actually try and play, guess what happens, THE SAME LOGIN ERROR. I was so hyped to play it now that it was fixed. Very disappointed. Please fix this issue.",Negative
"The graphics, sceneries, the characters and the gameplay are absolutely amazing. usually im not really used to the combats like this one but its actually pretty fun! And im looking forward to more characters and area in the future! (also pls give me yanqing and bronya)",Positive
"Honestly one of the best game I played!!! Great graphics, beautiful characters even in the smallest details, very immersive experience, huge exploration. Everything is just perfect!!!",Positive
"It's a very good game, graphics are amazing, animation is great , and the character are unique . One thing I would like you to change is the Battle style I would like it to be more like geshin but besides that the game is good.",Positive
"Never thought that I'd like a gacha game but this is genuinely one of the best turn-based JRPGs I've played in recent times. I think I might be liking this more than Persona 5. The production values (animation, music, voice actors) are through the roof, but it's the writing that really elevates it to the next level. I can see this being my main game for a very long time if it's as well supported as Genshin. Thank you Mihoyo!",Positive
"Was not excited for the turn based gameplay but to my surprise I'm enjoying the game. It's simple, easy to learn, and has just enough depth to be interesting. I play other games that can be tiring so Star Rail is a nice change of pace. The gacha is brutal so spend responsibly. The game feels very polished. The writing has good humor. Love the character designs!",Positive
"So far the game was very enjoying and the turn base style is quite interesting for me even though Im nee with the gameplay, the story and flow is awesome too, there had been quite issue with the graphic settings for certain phones but the game is overall good.",Positive
"20 pull for first launch? Why so stingy? Graphics and aesthetic is a mix of genshin and honkai. I still think Honkai Impact is so much better even though it's so much older and also so much generous when it comes to gacha. I'm not a fan of turn based RPG, but I have to give it to you guys, it's better than other similar games I've tried. In addition to that, I think iOs version needs better optimization. It runs really hot on iPad Pro M2. It keeps thermal throttling when it shouldn't.",Negative
"Good ost, quite good gameplay, very good story telling, faster progressing than genshin, since you can teleport almost everywhere and overall a great experience. The leveling up isn't slow, nor too fast. It's actually enjoyable going up levels",Positive
"I love it. I was a big honkai fan and have liked genshin too. This game is the perfect mix of both of them and i love it. I sadly had to stop playing honkai impact, so I'm very happy to have this wonderful game now. The characters are very likable and names like: Seele, Welt and Himeko, really brought back memories. The gameplay may take a bit getting used to, but it's really fun once you did. Graphics are amazing too. It's an absolute win",Positive
"A great game! The only problem is it sometimes says ""Error code"" or something everytime I log in the game for about 2 or 1 times, but it still works and loads fast... A bit laggy on my phone though, but that's my phone's problem.. Overall I think this game is great and cool! Great work hoyoverse.",Positive
"I actually owe this game an apology. This is probably because my personal experience with genshin/ honkai games and jrpg as a whole. The gameplay loop is great. There is always a things for you to do. If you run out of energy, there is always random quests with good rewards and good writing for the most part. The character skills and item systems make sense and fair. The dev surely put a lot of effort and care in making this game which is rare for a game this size.",Positive
"Allow for skip functions to include skipping skills animation, otherwise everytime load skills animation make it into setting checkbox which users can skip ultimate and skills. So battle will be fast. Like other turn based games and rpg mmo they allow skip animation for both skills and ultimate.",Negative
"Looks like a lot of fun but doesn't run on older devices. My phone meets the specs listed in the app store but it's glitchy, and eventually just freezes up. Couldn't complete the tutorial.",Negative
"Overall game is spectacular! Graphic, Charcters, and Etc. The game is absolutely incredible, but my only issue and problem that I dislike is that the fights are in turns, I know a lot of games like other famous mihoyo apps such as genshin impact and honkai impact 3 because most players love it better to fight freely. Leaving that aside my expectations for the game is how I expected it anyways, it was perfect.",Positive
"Everything is sooo good in this game; Graphics, Character designs, powers, Storyline, but wish there could be an option for changing our main character's look in which we are play as‚Äî I am hoping there will be option for changing looks and outfits in the future updates üôèüèª",Positive
The type of game I have been waiting to play for years!! Finished all quests in less than a month and that too because I was taking it slowly and savoring every little detail the devs put into it. Thank you for creating this wonderful gem!,Positive
"As a genshin player too which also is known for really good graphics, honkai exceeded all the expectations, the graphics was the god tier, the combat system was really good for me and the element system and role system was also detailed, it may overheat your phone a bit due to this good quality but if you ask me, it is worth it.",Positive
"Amazing. Although there are certain bugs (that always gets addressed), the game is filled with various characters that are brought to life by the writers. The story is also emotionally and logically driven, and the music still slaps. Thann you god yu peng chen.",Positive
"I love this game, one of my favourites so far. But Im sure Im not the only one experiencing problems with that ""login error 1001_3"" and others, specially after the version 1.1, before I managed to enter the gamw but now everything is lagging too much, and I can't enter the game. Im a mobile player and I admit that my phone isnt the best but Im pretty sure its not a phone problem, because other people also have it. Please fix this error, I already sent 3 emails for hoyoverse and nothing was done",Positive
I am gonna give it 5 stars although the gameplay is great and really put the emphasis on using your head although there are some issues such as stuttering or frame drops on cutscenes which I believe can improve other then that it is a great experience.,Positive
"Very fun game BUT.. the game is not ftp or even light spending friendly if you enjoy advancing your accounts in games you play. Materials for leveling is just horrible, worse than Genshin if you've ever played it. Everything needs to be leveled, numerous different aspects on each character, weapons, skills etc. Your pay walled if you'd like to play more then 15 minutes a day. VERY short story. There will be more story but as of right now it's non existent. Pass until it's fixed.",Negative
"Honestly, I love it and it fixes the majority of things I didn't like about Genshin. I still think the gacha is scummy as hell but I had major issues with it in Genshin too and it's the exact same system here so yeah. Other than that though I really have no complaints, game is amazing and the free characters are all very viable too. Please hoyo, add a jump button!!!",Positive
"The game itself is great, but we need coop system. Also make the game more tolerate toward weak network connection, it's just worst when in battle the game redirect you to reconnect because of the bad network.",Negative
"I tried it for a few hours and honestly still feel good, and fresh. The only problem I have and wish the dev would add is the chat log, because sometimes the characters talked too fast and I can't replay or see what the characters said since there's no log to access",Positive
"Honestly really good game turn based combat a story that has its moments of droning but it pulls you back in an instant by throwing some curve ball at you, I would love to have this not only be on PC and Mobile exclusive but maybe bring it to Console i mean i feel this would do good as Genshin in my opinion",Positive
"Game works really good! Only strange thing I found is if you turn the reflection setting too high, the background/environment will turn completely white, I think it's a glitch.",Positive
Best game out there (turn based though) has wonderful characters with unique skills and animation for every character a very immersive story as well as fun interactions with puzzles and simply mind-blowing world's to explore (the characters cannot jump though),Positive
"I generally enjoy honkai star rail, speaking from experience. The art and quality is as expected of Hoyoverse and storyline and characters are as good as people say. However, I'd prefer if the story was slightly longer since it didn't take me long to finish. I would also like if there was a co-op version or if we could use the honkai:star rail stickers in chats with friends. Please do consider my opinion.",Positive
"Just know, that this is not a sequel to Honkai Impact 3rd. There are crossover characters, however it is ultimately a standalone game. If you're coming to play this with Genshin Impact in mind, you will be disappointed. As this game has a completely different playstyle as it is turn based. It is also not technically open world. Personally tho, I think this game is by far the best out of the most populars of hoyoverse (gi,hi3) the story is immersive, and the characters have actual personalities.",Positive
"The drop rates for character banners are abysmal, fights take too long, and some of the bosses make Elden Ring bosses seem less aggravating. The cool characters and fun story are just not enough to make me want to put up with the aggravating gameplay and horrible drop rates. Save yourself time and money and don't bother with this one unless the devs do something to make the game player friendly.",Negative
"All the reasons I stopped playing Genshin Impact exist in this game. Seemed like a fresh concept in the beginning, but after a couple days of playing I could see some of the same features I didn't like in Genshin. The steep summoning costs, annoying characters (beep beep beep!), grindy routines all took center stage pretty quickly. They're character design remains top notch though.",Negative
Hit level 80 and the end game is just too difficult. I don't mind grinding for characters. But having to grind for everything else to the point it is impossible to have a team of level 80's fundamentally undermines the game system of weaknesses. The idea of a level 90 just does not seem fun. Playing everyday for 3 months and not being able to use all my characters finally undermined the fun for me.,Negative
The game is really fun. Don't let the 4 ability combat system fool you. There are many hidden details and complexities to how fights play out; it is quite rewarding to see a team comp that you had in your mind work and do high damage.,Positive
"Gacha game where you spend $100s for premium or settle for the free 4stars and enjoy the game as it is offered. Story is weak, some characters are annoying as hell, but overall a good way to waste your time. If you are looking for action, this isn't it, there's always Genshin or Honkai Impact. If you want a deep narrative experience, there are better games out there.",Positive
"It'll be more fun if we can do co-op mode (playing together with friends or random people) to fight bosses or domain with the same mechanic as Genshin Impact. Haha, how greedy of me. Overall, it's a nice turn-based game with open world concept. It's also F2P (Free to Play) since the character are quite balance. The story, art, and design are as expected from HoYoverse, really satisfying. Keep the good work going ^^",Positive
"Great graphics, great combat. Story doesn't know when to stop talking. This games story is worth skipping but you can't skip it, characters just regurgitate exposition endlessly.",Positive
"The gameplay is fun and the graphics are good. Unit draw rates are outright terrible though, I've been rerolling on a second account 2 to 3 times a day since release and still have not pulled a high end unit.",Negative
This Game is awesome! I love the character design and the graphics is cool! But there's always an error I had everytime I log in into the game it took me many times to finally log in the game,Positive
"Honestly I just like basically everything about it. This isn't really affected bias really I just think it's a good game with fantastic design, story, and world building (character diversity could definitely use some work though).",Positive
"An amazing game, great content and such a joy to play. The lack of a skip button is somewhat bearable and the combat is fun. So why 1 star, beacause of their stingy rewards, no doubt it's a major upgrade from genshin but what is the point, each achievement gives 5, 10 etc. Dailys give a pull every three days, the story gives you currency after a long quest, and that's about it. Honestly so much more games are following this stingy agenda now, because people don't see the problem with this anymor",Negative
"is a very good game the history and graphics are beautiful but i feel strange because i play honkai impact and genshin impact so I didn't expect a Turn-based game, sometimes the battles are very slow and more while you farm artifacts but the game are that. without this the game will be perfect but this isn't the case",Positive
Amazing character creation. Their vast and different designs bring it to life. It's amazing. The beautiful surroundings really add to the theme of the game. Amazing job with each of the different abilities and such.,Positive
Games amazing the story the attention to detail the world building and FOR FREE?! I dont get where all these bad reviews are coming from but the dont deserve it even the turn based combat is intuitive. Dont listen to the haters hyoverse has done it again and then some!,Positive
"Combat can be fully auto-d or played after a certain point down to preference, excellent dialogue, excellent endgame systems, developers keep giving us good updates with qol, freebies and making this game have more endgame love. If turn based isn't your thing stay away but otherwise much love.",Positive
"At first I thought this game would be boring, but after I play it it just give me more and more suprise, there's so much details in this game. Almost evey single items in this game are interactive and I really really enjoy them. The game characters design were so good. Even the story and the PvP system were amazing.",Positive
It's a great game but it reset my whole account like genshin impact did in the past so I lost all my progress and characters. Which is very annoying cause I almost all the characters. But it's still a good game.,Positive
"best game but I thought it was a multiplayer game, but overall good! I am currently addicted to it lol and I hope there's more story lines soon cause it's really really good. and I wish there would be like a multiplayer version of this game too, and I do recommend making a game like this for offline mode but anyway that's all!",Positive
"Story and character-stories are amazing, but the turn-based gameplay is very tiring. I loved the simulated universe but even this became boring after a few weeks. Still worth 4 stars for the story, world building, character design and lore though.",Positive
Great turn based rpg. Resects time put in. To amount of rewards given. Each update is exciting and feels refreshing and I look forward to each one. Listens to player feedback. Add features we thought we never thought of but are great.,Positive
"The game play totally suit my style. Loved turn based games since I used to play the game made by Clover, but its too grindy. Love the characters too especially Caelus and Stelle, Dan Heng and March. Looking forward to their journey into planets, and interactions to the other characters.",Positive
"The gameplay is nice, the character design and OST are enjoyable too. And basically that's it... Their is no content (login, daily, use your stamina and logout), it's not f2p friendly. Even with the monthly package it's still very poor. Like genshin you have to pull on the character banner and his weapon. The system of pity mixed with limited banner just force you to pull/pay if you don't want to wait 6 months before a rerun. There are a lot of turned base gacha a way better than this one.",Negative
"The best and bland gacha team is back. You've got cute and fun characters, a deep lore, a fun stream of events, and a thriving fan base. I had to stop because the game was becoming less fun and this always gets me with multiple gachas. They never finish the dang story. It expands like a friends homebrew campaign and you forget why you're here in the first place. 10/10",Positive
"Honkai Star Rail is a turn-based action rpg made by Mihoyo. The gameplay & mechanics, truly differs from what Genshin Impact plays like. And there's some fans that disappointed on this because they thought it's going to be a real time combat/open world like, Genshin Impact. But that's the reason why Honkai Star Rail is refreshing, it's completely different take from Genshin Impact. It takes on the liberty of exploring a small area to another and making tactical & strategical maneuver on combat.",Positive
Can't even play says that login failed when I try to play. Day 2: I was able to pay a little until I had to close the game. Getting it to load is laggy. But it now gives me the same error over and over again. No matter how many times I log out and log back in.,Negative
"This game is too hard, forget about playing it. It's lore is needlessly complicated with jargons and nonsense words literally made up just to make things complicated. Gameplay is exciting at first but you cannot use items in combat which for a turn base game is really weird. Did I mention it's difficult? You need to pay to win this game. You need to buy as many powerful characters as possible to even get through the basic story. I'm still playing it, but it just frustrates me every time.",Negative
"I like it a lot. The characters are well scripted, and the combat looks beautiful. Vivid colors and great landscaping. However, it would seem that I have already beat the game. There's only 3 worlds to explore and only so many missions to do. Leaving me with nothing to do until more is added.",Negative
"Visuals and sounds compliment each other. I personally love the story and music in this game. Only 4 star because the gacha system is pretty bad here and rarely see a 5 starred roll but not bad, just extremely gamble heavy. If prone to gambling stay away youll pull your hair out. Quite frankly the main character and 4 star units are good enough for the game progression, which is testament to how balanced this game is. Overall positive experience",Positive
"This game is what I've been looking for a while fun turn based combat no energy systems so you can play all day, no ridiculous difficulty spike/ grind, plenty of side quest and mini games, minor pay system that you can complete ignore. Solid cast of characters with there own unique personalities (standard anime arcatypes) I love this game the combat the music the art style I'm currently lvl 50 and I can't complain so far a wonderful mobile gaming experience. Highly recommend you play it.",Positive
"I love this game alot, the story and graphics are absoluetly awsome..but the reason why its 4 star is because whenever a conematic plays it would always lag and the sound would be delayed and laggy...please..hoyoverse..please fix this..i love the cinematics very much but it keeps lagging so its very hard to enjoy those breath taking cinematics",Positive
"I've always wanted to try out the beta version of this game ever since it blew up all over the social media, but now I finally get to play it. They beta testers were right, this game is entertaining and is really worth of your time. If you're into very chill gameplay then you should definitely try out this game, it has amazing character designs, story, and not to mention the background music is 10/10. Well done Hoyoverse. Been looking forward to this game and it did not disappoint.",Positive
"This is a major improvement over other Hoyoverse games. You can tell that they have learned from their previous games and updated and fixed so much to make this game an overall great experience. From the story, which so far has been stellar, the music which is phenomenal and the characters are great. It's still a gacha game, so if that's not your cup of tea then this'll not be a game for you.",Positive
"Honestly I have played all hoyoverse games and nothing can beat them. So far i have no complains or issues with the game it is entertaining as usual, graphics and storyline are good too. Characters are also interesting throughout the game. Fighting battles are also good with auto battle it is easier to play too.",Positive
"I can see why for some people this game is great but really not for me. The game is too repetitive, straight forward, grind, lv up, try again. Ironically barely need any strategy if you have the op character like seele and silverwolf. It's just too boring for me.",Negative
Ran out of space and stopped playing. Lost everything when i switched phones. Now i could easily run it and more but to have to start over or pay for a starter pack is too daunting to consider. I had a great time while i played and i still miss it,Positive
"Story is nice, but very confusing. I didn't know what was going on in the first hour of the game because they don't explain the basics (e.g.: what aeons are, or what paths mean, what a stellaron is, etc). I had to search up some videos on YouTube to understand at least some of the story.",Positive
"The game play is really repetitive, after you complete most of the quests, you basically have nothing to do except log in and do the dailies. But it's always the characters that pull me back, unfortunately",Positive
"Literally love it, the animation is super cool though. I was kind of bad at playing this game in the beginning, but after 5 months of playing, I finally managed to complete the Memory of Chaos. Just realized how important support and speed are in this game.",Positive
"I love everything about the game. However, when I teleport, I can get stuck in the loading screen and I have to close the app and get back on. I'm also just getting a complete close of the app for no reason. This can be very annoying to me.",Positive
"I really love everything. The graphics, the sound, the story and THE GAMEPLAY especially. Turn based is remind me of my teenage games. But hoyoverse, it would be better if you give me another 5* character insteaf of awaken my Bailu (it just a peaceful reminder btw üôÑ)",Positive
"I can't recommend this game enough, it's absolutely amazing from its storytelling to graphics to overall function. To those that are involved with the game, I say thank you for a awesome experience and keep up the great work.",Positive
"I love everything about it. The game play, skill effects, voice lines, and lore. I'm a honkai impact player so I know who some of the characters are and its very nice to see them again but in a different verse. I love to see more content and new exciting characters.",Positive
"Love Hoyo's work, especially the 1st and half year of genshin's run... But star rail's grinding is insane, everything needed to better a character drops very low with a high demand on ""resin"", at this point to me this game just feels like gaming slavery, grind all day everyday and its day on and day on because of course theres a point where u need 8 characters ready to fight. Oh, and customer support is still trash. It doesn't seem to care about bugs if u don't provide video or ss.",Negative
"Love the game. Love the story and graphics. Love gameplay mechanics and battles aren't very stressful. You can like, spend 20 minutes on this daily and log out. It doesn't consume too much time. Perfect for casual players like me.",Positive
"A Honkai game made in the Genshin format, best of both worlds with the most interesting turn based gameplay I've played on mobile. Everything is gorgeous and has actual challenge that isn't just massive stats. Overall amazing game with lots of potential going forward. Also gacha is kind and free character selector at 300 pulls",Positive
"The game is good, but suffers from poor optimization on low end devices. The developer is like ""You want to play our game? You better have a flagship phone with monster specs!"" Unfortunately, not everyone can afford a flagship. Some of us only use mid to low spec phones (me included, i use a Samsung Galaxy M51 with SD 730G and 8GB ram, and bumped down the settings to Very Low., and it still lags)",Negative
"After my eventual downfall with Genshin Impact, it astonishes me how much the quality of life in Honkai: Stae Rail precedes its preceeding title. Story is fantastic, music is amazing, characters are fun and interesting, lore looks promising, combat is cool, and the whole game is surprisingly funny. Runs pretty well on mobile, but PC is my optimal choice of gameplay. Nevertheless, Honkai: Star Rail has some of the best 120-hour initial impressions you can have in a game this year. It's addictive!",Positive
"Beautiful game, but kinda hard to experience how beautiful when it runs pretty slow on my phone and computer. Considering I can play punishing gray raven on phone without out issue this is kinda unacceptable, but hopefully it's fixed soon.",Positive
"Everything about this game is amazing. I've heard some people say that the amount of dialogue is annoying, but after a while of playing it I realised how good the story was. The characters are amazing, good gacha system and OUT OF THIS WORLD ULTIMATES! These are just some things I find great. If I said everything about this game that I love, I'd die from old age. 11/10 game",Positive
"This game is really good but the pull rates are bad and it's hard to get enough materials to do 10 pulls, there's also way to much text which makes it more boring. btw I need help getting back into my account, I deleted the game and I just downloaded it back but it won't let me get back into my account. Can you help me? Please and thank you.",Negative
"Incredible story, music, characters, voice acting, lore, animations, and much more. Treat the game like a single-player rpg to immerse yourself in, and you will have an amazing experience.",Positive
"Very fun, although the gameplay is rather dull due to the very limited amount of things you can do in a turn. The character designs and overall game artwork is fantastic, people who are into the anime-like aesthetic would surely love this game's art design. The story is above average, gacha system is a bit forgiving. A chill game since there's an auto-battle in it. I give this game an 8.5/10",Positive
"The only problem i have right now is the game's space optimisation, similar to genshin impact it is going to run into the problem of having no space, i really think they should implement deleting previous CLEARED/limited content so that the game does not take a bunch of space.",Negative
"its fun!! but after playing for 8 days its started to crash so much. it was olso glitching alot, and it was freezing. i know it wasn't my phone bcs everything else in my phone was working except honkai, i loved this game but i just hate getting to freeze every 5 minutes of playtime :(( i hope you get this message devs",Negative
"I'm rating this game a 3 Star only due to the horrible drop rates on summoning 5 star characters and light cones. The only option to reliably acquire new 5 star characters is to spend real $$$. Once you finish the story and eat up all sources of premium currency there is no way to get new better characters and their light cones unless you get super lucky. That being said Story is excellent, the characters are lively and interesting. The grind for mats is tolerable compared to other mobile games.",Negative
"One of my favourites games so far ! I kinda find the critics too harsh for a game that just got released... For these that complain about ""nothing to do, no content"" It's because you rushed it all already... I mean you can't expect in a month to have 1000 characters, 100 maps, and a ton of events and content. What's important is building your team and have your own progress, you have to be a minimum patient and it's a rpg game so I don't understand the ""linear"" complaint while there's far worse",Positive
The graphics looks so good despite using low settings. The battle systems are simple yet it's fun to play. The cutscenes looks nice and revamped the quality of games before it to the next level,Positive
"A very fun game. Though I play this game only for some specific characters, it is still very fun to explore the universe and uncover secrets and plots. It also has an auto battle option which is very convenient when I have other things to attend to.",Positive
"This game was my favorite it was smooth and playable no bugs but, when update 1.1 the game becomes buggy in my device the map were disappearing and showing I can't even play properly at the beginning of the game it's so buggy the train is half invisible have visible pls fix this I don't have any device yet and I want to play this more pls fix it:(((",Negative
"Currently I have been enjoying this new game of Hoyoverse a lot! Its such a good break from Genshin, since I'm mostly burnt out and have no motivation to play. Star Rail is a turn-combat styled RPG, overworld mechanics like other Hoyoverse (Mihoyo) games. It contains a gacha system wich so much fair than Genshin! I have no words that describe how joyful I am playing this game. The story is alright from what I know(i skip all dialogue but from cutscenes and SOME it doesn't have any large flaws)",Positive
"This game overall good but i have bug, when i play, the characters and buildings temporarily disappear and then reappear and so on, its so annoying, please fix this and why my ping always red? even though my wifi is running smoothly, ok thats my complain and please fix that, thanks",Positive
"Best cross platform turn-based rpg of 2023. I can play on both my mobile phone and PS5 smoothly. Great graphics, great character design, great storytelling, great combat mode and gameplay, great in-game QOL, devs keep updating contents like small mini games. Would be better if gacha rate is be more kind to players and need more end-game content for max trailblazer level players.",Positive
"Love the gameplay, characters are everything! As a genshin player, most of the features are considered new for me. I like how we can message the characters. The fighting style is amazing too! I need not fear of getting killed when I'm afk. So far so good, love the story quests and excited to see new characters getting added to the game. I shall wait for kafka's presence. Hope I win the 5050 and get her light cone",Positive
"You know, you really need to download this game and try it. Its game style can be sci-fi, Chinese style and British style. Then,Its roles are very attractive, each with its own unique characteristics. In short, everything depends on your opinion (this is just a personal opinion)",Positive
"Lacking in depth, but pretty fun time-waster for now. Seeing how much content Genshin has these days I expect this game to add in way more thing to do eventually. But as it stands now, there isn't a whole lot to do in the current version of the game after clearing the story and weekly reward limits.",Negative
It was an amazing game before the 1.1 update but after if I can't even play the game at all.I can get into the game but after a few seconds it just crashes.I don't know if it's my phone that's the problem but I know other people are experiencing this and I hope it can get resolved.,Negative
"Hello, I really like this game and have been playing from release. But today, I deleted it and reinstalled it for storage reasons and what I tried to login, it's saying "" Too many requests please try again later "" I have been trying to login since the afternoon, but nothing changed. Please fix this or answer me on how to fix this",Positive
"As expected of Hoyoverse. Stunning character design and skills, interesting backstory and character development, tons of neat features‚Äì everything is on par with what you'd expect from a Hoyoverse game. The thing that bothers me is that that's it. It is just another Hoyoverse game. No revolutionary game mechanics, no interesting way of telling a story that isn't just people talking, no new way of getting new characters. While I am happy with this game, I do think it could've been a but more.",Positive
"Fun until you catch up on the story, then everything pretty much grinds to a halt. Materials needed to upgrade or pull on the gacha are so scarce that it just doesn't feel worth the exceedingly slow grind. So now it's basically a waiting game for new content: get in, do dailies/weeklies, get out. Also end game is just suffering through terrible relic substat rng, no thank you",Negative
"I've played it over 70 hours now so I can say game is kinda mid definitely expected more from it the cutscences are laggy acquiring materials is kinda hard as there's less availability of quests increasing trailblazing level is kind of pain etc I can keep going but I will play it as I like the character design and story is good, I will remain a f2p tho.",Negative
"Great game,good graphics and pretty simple to play in Mobile,The Story Characters,Animation and Special Effect in game look awesome.I like the Auto Play function,is quite helpful when you want to ""farm/grind"" for Exp/Materials ect.The Gacha is like other games (Save Your Stellar Jades) for the characters you really like or want.",Positive
"It feels like this game is so good but Idk why I can't play it, I've been stocked on starting screen then it keeps on quitting automatically. I badly want to play this game so please fix this. I waited a lot of time to download its resources and as a result star rail just gave me a disappointment.",Negative
"story 7/10, graphics 7/10, gameplay super automated 2/10, leveling 5/10, sounds 8/10, battle graphics & intensity 5/10 could be better, got tired of it fast because of the automated system, heats the phone (not recommended for devices but yes on PC or CONSOLE, will play it later on in a year see if anything changes, just lost interest of doing same old thing as other games.",Negative
"I'm enjoying the game, but geez, either speed up the cut scenes and ""interactive"" cut scenes, or let players who don't want to sit through them skip them. They take forever to get past them.",Negative
"Like all Hoyoverse games, this game has extremely high production value. It looks great, and while lower-end phones might struggle, it's not as big a deal for a turn-based RPG. Like Genshin, this is a massive game, and it will take a long time to catch up to the current content. Unlike Genshin, this one has a good story and fun writing, and it actually gets quality of life updates. If you must get a Hoyoverse game for your phone, this is the best option.",Positive
"A waste of time once you hit the end. Once you are there, the game expects you to grind endlessly for just a bit of mats or exp for characters. Even worse they then expect you to start creating 2 teams or have very specific setups. Which does not work with summoning mechanics. You literally get a bunch of useless blue traces. You don't reward the player for wasting money/jades to draw. You just fill their inventories with junk. If I spend 10 draw chances you should get 5-10 chars. Not this bs",Negative
"From a company which earns that much money, im kinda disappointed. Dont get me wrong, there are many plus points, like Charakteres, combat, graphics aso...but gameplaywise after a certain lvl you will hit a kinda playstop wall. Then you have a daily routine which is done in few minutes and thats it. Farming ""trash"" for the last point of efficiency is what i wouldnt consider calling it fun...so i personally really hope there will be more soon.",Negative
"The new update made it unplayable on 4gb ram low end phones. The previous version is barely playable on the lowest settings barely below 30fps and constant freezing both on gameplay and in importantly the title menu, can't even log in anymore.",Negative
I liked Genshin Impact but everything that eventually kept me from continuing to play that one is not present in this one. This is so much better. And you get so many pulls for free right now that you will have plenty of characters to play with. My favorite part is the strategy in combat. Very well done.,Positive
"I am not a fan of turn based games tbh and after genshin its my second gacha game.. but i will have to admit this game... this game is literally something else.. top notch voice acting, excellent visuals, battle music(this one's my fav) and many more.. if someone is wondering whether they should get into this game... no second thoughts; but as always be prepared to enter the hell world of gacha.. 5/5 from me",Positive
Been playing this from Day 8 from worldwide release. Easily one of the best gacha games made. Game rewards players very well. There is a guaranteed 5-Star Character of YOUR choosing for the standard banner. The pity system is easily one of the best ones out there. If you like turn based JRPGs then you'll probably like this too. Characters are interesting and unique. Story so far has been good. Main boss tracks are huge bangers and really amp up the fights. AND it's really kind to F2P players.,Positive
The cut scenes are still glitching When the game came out it was like that so I quit the game since it was new I waited for more updates and stuff but still the cut scenes are still glitching even tho my device has g99 which is good for gaming and runs the game fine with high -medium settings.,Negative
"Honkai Star Rail is a solid turn based RPG, but the best part about this game is the amount of care the developers show to its players. I really feel like I'm appreciated when playing this game, and I'm sure you will too. There's always something to do and they're always improving and hardly, if ever, disappoint. Really excited to see what is in HSR's future. Congratulations to the Honkai Star Rail team. You guys have done an incredible job with this game. I have no complaints.",Positive
"Best game i ever played so far.the graphic is top quality. the characters' design is very similar to genshin impact, but it is still well done.i also like the fact that the game is turned base.the game is very unique in it own way. highly recommend the game for people who are interested in turn based game",Positive
"This is Hoyo's best game. I am very impressed with it! The characters, story, combat, music, pacing, humor etc. It nails the execution wonderfully. Really having a blast with Star Rail. March 7 is so wholesome. Looking forward to many future updates. I'm gonna stick with this one for sure.",Positive
"So far, I'm level 43 and caught up on the current story. I really like this game due to how ftp friendly it is. Losing your 50/50 on the limited banner isn't as scary as genshin because all of the standard 5 star characters can be a great addition to any team. Overall I highly recommend this game since it's free to download, you can clear all content without spending anything, and they respect your time.",Positive
"I've been playing Honkai Star Rail ever since it was released, but ever since the Version 1.1 update, the game has been extremely laggy and glitchy. The load times are much longer, and the animations are choppy. I really want to enjoy the game, but the technical issues are making it difficult for me to do so. I hope the developers take note of these issues and release updates to improve the game's stability and performance.",Positive
Meh at best. Battle system is below average with only 2 skills to use one of which being the ultimate. Gacha is horrible and pity is too high at 90. It also does not give any meaningful rewards for achievements and world clears which just sucks. The only saving grace is the story being slightly entertaining.,Negative
"I wish I could rate this game well, however it follows the same disgustingly greedy practices as genshin impact. Until they improve gacha rates, and reduce their prices, I cannot, in good conscious recommend this game. The game is quite good otherwise, but it's simple way too greedy. And unlike Genshin, it doesn't have the claim of being one of the largest open world games on mobile, or being cross platform. It is way too money hungry to be worth your time, unless you're a lottery winner.",Negative
"Really love this game. The story, animation, and character design are well made. The combat isn't that challenging and provide auto battle feature, so you can do farm while doing your work or something else.",Positive
"I was completely mesmerized by the way the MC (also known as Caelus, the male one) began to whimper and groan of the pain he felt while consuming the substance that he was given by the evil doctor lady. It was such an exciting experience that it made me curl my toes as I plugged in my headphones and started to listen to the noises that he made. I would like it if there were more scenarios like that because it was a 10/10 for me. Please add more, and thank you.",Positive
"Expected greatness from a new Hoyoverse game and I was not disappointed. It even exceeded my expectations, I thoroughly enjoy the game and it really is reminiscent of OG Final Fantasy, a modernized anime version. The game's quirkiness, smoothness, amount of quality work put into the game is very noticeable and everything amalgamates to make Star Rail a fantastic game. Keep pushing for excellence and fun Hoyoverse. Thank you for making a great game.",Positive
"Disappointing game after playing Genshin. Was really expecting a high caliber rpg but beyond visuals this game is slow, unoriginal, and lacks an interesting battle system. It feels clunky and battles lack any engagement, impact, and fun. It might get better but I basically lost interest in an hour. Didn't even interest me enough to pull on the gacha and that's saying something as I love free pulls.",Negative
Finally able to login and what a waste of time. Long drawn out dialog that u can't skip auto battle is still locked and so is speed up. You spend 90% of the time in dialog the other 10 is fighting the most annoying fights. Didn't make past elevator and uninstalled. Would 0 star if I could.,Negative
"Everything about the game is fantastic, however there's one issue. When cutscene appear it suddenly turns very laggy. I love story cutscenes and this REALLY bothers me. I hope you can fix it soon",Positive
I sincerely enjoy this game. I've already played it for months now but I started having issues logging in yesterday. It took me hours and I'm still stuck on the log in screen. Tries to clear the storage and redownload resources but now I can't download resources even though I'm using wifi. Please I need help!,Negative
"Very funny, all interactions between characters and objects are very interesting, the graphics are high, voice acting and music quality is excellent, takes 8 gb space however it is totally worth it.",Positive
"Excellent turn based RPG with a ton of content, exceedingly high quality visuals and satisfying and replayable gameplay. Additionally, very reasonable as far as Gacha goes in not necessitating constantly pulling to keep up. Would definitely recommend.",Positive
Enjoyable turn-based-action with great graphics! The characters are enjoyable and has a great story that I can't wait for more of and genuinely rewards players more than most gacha games. I love this space adventure on a space ship train as a concept so much!,Positive
"It's better than similar Turn Based titles. Yes unlike Genshin, it's TURN BASED. (like Dragon Quest but a Gacha) You can really see all the love and effort that's gone into designing it, and the story feels very fresh.This isn't my favorite genre, but that's irrelevant üòÖ I give it a solid 9/10 purely from a content quality look. The playable characters already feel so much more relatable than Genshin. The male MC though lanky, is actually tall, and I'm ü§§ the +cup sizes so far.",Positive
Amazing game. Everything is great and stuff. The story is amazing and well-done. I have played genshin and now I feel like I should move to this game! It didn't disappointed me in anyway. And i loved how different this is as for its turn-based and i have never tried that so it's way more fun! And so much more. And it gives way more rewards then genshin! So i feel more special playing this game.,Positive
"You know, for me, I'm not a fan of turn base games at all. I think they're very boring, but once I gave this game a go, my goodness am I addicted to this game. From the graphics to the story to the amazing characters. Everything about this game is absolutely worth playing for, thank you hoyoverse for making another great game üëç.",Positive
"This game is perfect for my busy schedule. Love the art style and play style, especially the character design. Just perfection (for me at least) and let's not forget about their generous rewards. Totally worth my time and money",Positive
"I've always been a huge fan of hoyoverse and their projects, and Honkai Star Rail is definitely one up there. The story is really complex but we can still enjoy with other parts of the game. I have no complaints and I'm hoping that some minor bugs in the game will be fixed soon!!",Positive
"The Game is a Masterpiece as expected But there some bugs need to be fix Like My graphics experience glitches when screen recording.. but when im not screen recording it's all fine Also while on genshin impact i can screen record well, without a problem even i use highest graphics Also another issue is there's no chatbox to chat other players Hope we can chat in the future updates",Positive
"It's a really great app 10/10 for sure, but the game keeps crashing every time I try to open and play the game. It works just fine on my phone, but it just closes the app before I even begin to play. It keeps crashing when it says ""Patch Running"". Please fix it if it's possible. I haven't played in a few months.",Positive
"I play on pc and is a wonderfully made game the graphics are amazing and the voice acting is phenomenal but sadly with the new update the game wont launch, I've tryed everything even uninstalling and reinstalling, to no avail so I can no longer play but other than that it is an amazing game definitely would recommend^^",Positive
"One of the few games I'm willing to spend money on. Admittedly, I only use the mobile version when I can't use my PC for whatever reason. However, I've never had any technical issues, and greatly enjoy the game. Make sure sound is on, the music is amazing!",Positive
"This is the best turn base game ever I am not a fan of turn base but this game changed my taste graphics, character design, music, story everything is top notch it lags some times and crashed once I hope it will be fixed next patch",Positive
"I absolutely adore this game, it's not hard and the gameplay is enjoyable for me. You get tons of free rewards quickly which is awesome!! Definitely recommend the game. I'm in love with the story and these amazing characters and the designs are so good. ‚ù§",Positive
"Gameplay is good but most OP heroes are unattainable without spending a ton. Also there isn't much content in this game, events are good but you can finish most within a day or two leaving you with nothing much to do. Don't know if I will play any longer, half in my friend list also quit.",Negative
"This is a very good,awesome game,one of the best,if not the best.Well rounded,superior storyline,outstanding gameplay and graphics.it seems too good to be on android.more like Xbox or PlayStation. Im absolutely hooked.i play it every day and wont stop.Thanks to the Development team.""Homerun"".",Positive
"Combat is just really bad: -Each character has 2 active skills only with turns determined by a unit called Speed, not player choice. -Repetitive lines -Positioning doesn't exist, character order almost does not matter. -2x speed is fake, since 1x is just 0.5x -Gameplay so boring they added Auto-battle so you don't even have to play. Story was good up until Xianzhou, then it gets really slow. DON'T BE MISTAKEN. THIS IS AN IDLE GAME, NOT TURN-BASED.",Negative
"After Downloading the files needed to play the game, It had a pink screen blocking the majority of the screen, I tried deleting the app and installing it again, but the pink screen bug was still there, to the developers please fix the problem thank you.",Negative
"Good game and all, but only problem is that every new character is more powerful than previous ones and requires a lot of resources I don't have, even with paid nameless honor. And also I got tired of this Chinese theme and ships, so boring, the snow planet was x100 better",Positive
It looks nice but i just spent an hour downloading resources for the second time in a month which used half my battery and made the phone almost too hot to touch. So i didnt actually get to play it. I just watched YouTube instead on another device while i waited.,Negative
"Its a really beautiful and immersive game! However, there is a problem with the login system because there would often be errors that would come out of nowhere.",Positive
"I played for a day with my phone. It wasn't half bad either, except bad frame rate. But that's because my phone is cheap. The next day, even with 250mb/s of internet, I'm getting constant timeout errors. I already spent $5 USD, and now it's gone. I don't mean to tell people what to do, but don't publish the game if the networks arent finished yet.",Negative
"as a genshin player, i really enjoyed playing this game, all the new types of paths and elements stuff, not only that many mistakes from genshin have been fixed in this one, also the new type of battle style is really amazing, i really wanted a change after Playing genshin for almost a year and this was probably my best bet",Positive
"A solid free to play turn based gacha game. No need to spend money to experience and enjoy all the content. Good starter 4 star characters will be provided along with the main character of your choice to start up your story. Good weapons/light cones can be obtained in game by exchanging tokens you earn through challenges. But remember it's a story based game, so there will be a lot of reading.",Positive
"A good game. I love especially love the graphics, but kinda sad that I can't utilize it to the maximum. The game just releases so it's understandable if there are some bugs and very laggy. I hope this game gets optimized as much as possible.",Positive
"The game is great, voice acting is great concept is...great. What I dont get is why does a PvE only game have to be so stingy on premium currency, especially for a %50 chance at hard pity to get the unit you find exciting to play? If you enjoy playing gotcha games this is a good one, IF you spend money. If f2p is the way for you then expect to use the units the game gives you and that's it. Takes the fun out for me if I can't play the units I find interesting.",Negative
"The story and characters are interesting and entertaining. The gameplay is simple and easy to play since it's turn-based with only basic atk, skills, and special atk which is perfect for me.",Positive
"I like Genshin. But as an emoloyee the map is too vast and the gameplay time needed to invest it just not for a working person like me. Luckily Hoyo introduced HSR. The map explorarion as just right (not too vast that will make you feel sleepy). Story are straight to the point but engaging. Turn base style make you remember of your childhood games (Pokemon, persona, etc). While enjoying the anime art style of the characters. 5/5 for a tired working gamer like me.",Positive
Eventhough this game is turn based fighting game. But it pretty fun to be honest and the character design is so cute. However I have problem to log in using phone. It always says login error. I have no problem login through pc.,Positive
"An amazing game, as a genshin enjoyer HSR really didnt disappoint, I love its artstyle, story and characters, one outstanding to me feature is also the amount of interactions with the objects in the world, and finally a proper MC, unlike genshin with paimon, you yourself actually have a decent amount of response choices in the quests, and the characters reacting accordingly. The gameplay being turn based and the game looking overall simpler also makes this game more mobile-friendly than genshin",Positive
"I love it, the change of the combat style and making it turn base is nice, i would love to see this game growlre in the future but i really hope you add a skip to the story because some people don't want to watch all of it",Positive
"Everything is so well designed visually though the amount of clicks an text is too mind numbing. The scaling of leveling is off, I'm unable to level characters to even beat levels and requires major grind for little drops or none to ascend characters. So many glitches. Crashes on load start screen, freezes randomly and more often click treasure boxes. No floor (all during wifi connection). Not enough events to level all very monotonous.",Negative
"I still can't believe this game is free! I struggled with playing Genahin Impact, and it was too hard for me. But Honkai Star Rail is way easier. Not that it isn't challenging, but it's more simple and easier to understand for new gamers. I acually prefer the aesthetic of HSR to Genshin.",Positive
"(This is edited feedback after some complaints has been emailed and had been solved) From my experience, this game was really fun , since I ever played turn based, but still this is what we called quality preservation üòÇüòÇüòÇ... The concept, similar like genshin, the storyline , absolutely interesting and attractive, yet worth to try even need to relog it for entry level specification like my phone (Honor X6/VNE-LX2) .... I had no regret since in overall, less much I can say, masterpieceüòèüëç",Positive
"I really love this game app its less stressful and enjoyable, then the story is grateful and the characters as well but when pulling a limited character is kinda bad maybe sometimes losing 50/50 or winning there makes me disappointed but that's okay, at least it can handle pulling limited characters. For now I will support you for this game and I hope this game will be a longer time thank you.",Positive
"great game, wonderful storyline so far, cool characters, would reccommend my only problem with this game is that it lags a lot especially when in battle. i don't know if this is a storage problem or somethong with my phone but it is super laggy despite having a lot of storage space",Positive
Hi um well I really like the game genshin impact but after a couple years of not playing it I entered my user and password it didn't work and new game star rail wont even let me in and I cleared out space still didn't work I really recommend genshin impact but warning if you don't play for a couple years won't work.can you pls help oh and the error code is 9907.,Negative
"It's a very good game with amazing graphics but after the update,my game started crashing on my phone nonstop and I can play it only after I redownload it again,but it then crash again if I try opening it again(I did research and my phone is suitable for the game graphics based on Google)",Negative
"Been playing since launch and just stopped. I can't recommend this game to any turn based RPG veteran. This barebones what you call a turn based RPG is aimed at the casuals who like ""story"", flashy animations, waifus, and hoyo. The end content is seriously lacking. Boring PvE and no pvp. No skip function.",Negative
"This is great game i like to be a solo player i dont know if u going to add some guild like other games but please dont and i love the fact there is no world chat or someone messaging me because i hate it and i wish u can add some other feature like dash, climb, ride or fly and also a pet by my side but its alright if there is not but i still wish my character can jump",Positive
"The game is beautiful looking. Smooth turn base combat, gorgeous characters and an interesting world worth learning about through the story. Progression in the game is quite smooth but the game suffers from a lack of content once you finish the main story. The lack of PvP is a big boon. However, keeping Genshins dreadful gacha system was a mistake. Split banners for weapons and characters is horrible and no way to attain dupes of 5* characters outside gacha are HUGE demerits.",Negative
"Absolutely a joy to play. Very refreshing and the characters are quite intriguing too! I love the turn based combat, Hoyoverse did a great job on it. Exploration and quests are fun and humourous, I'd recommend to anyone who wishes to play.",Positive
I like hsr better then genshin. it's more easier to understand and the details to the game are better and are cool to see. the fact everyone gets their own phone case? amazing. the fact we can play with peppy? amazing. the fact we can talk to trash cans like raccoons? phenomenal. the fact we get to text random characters daily? absolutely creative. the fact we can tell svarog nice haircut? üò≠ I live for that. the fact we get to send cute emotes to clara back? I ADORE IT.,Positive
This is the only game i have been playing a lot hour on mobile. This game is worth playing i really enjoy the storyline and side quest and keep upgrade charcter it's still really annoying for f2p player and keep doing daily quest everyday to earning gem to summon for gacha to get character. The turn based combat it's really interesting this game fun and i reallye enjoy to play this game for collecting character after few years. I hope the update still keep goin and see what's find out.,Positive
"Very fun and unique game. Game concept is very different from other games I play. You should give it a try, you might even fall in love with it. Anime style concept. Only bad thing, takes up huge storage space and sometimes laggy",Positive
One of the best turn based games I have played since persona 5 royal. Definitely worth your time if your into those type of games. Really streamline and probably the most AAA experience you'll get with a mobile game aside from Genshin Impact. I don't really need to explain more I'm just really enjoying the experience!,Positive
"What a disappointment considering the reputation of the company. Problem 1. So. Much. Dialogue. Can't. Skip. A lot of dialogue is completely irrelevant to the main storyline but they drag on and ON. Problem 2. The devs reuse assets too much. I'm about 12 hours in. Still the same mobs, all the NPCs look copy pasted. Problem 3. Severely lacking variety of characters, especially when you consider how the element matters. Problem 4. Massive power boost from pulling duplicates. Etc. etc.etc.",Negative
This game feels like it is a test of patience. Right now it's just simply storing/hoarding for your next favourite/meta banner. Perhaps more sense of rewards when we clear roaming mobs or simulated universe. Other than that this is an awesome game! So 4 stars for now Cheers!,Positive
"I'm giving 5 stars to this game, even though it crashes every time you open it so you have to open it a second time and it sometimes lag, still a 5-star. Why? For the 240 resin increase and how F2P friendly it is, like I'm not even joking or saying bs about it. You can easily reach soft pity, without spending a single cent, like that's how F2P the gacha system is. I haven't spend anything and I have most 5-stars already. Edit: the game just keeps getting better, 10 stars.",Positive
So far the game is fantastic the only complain I have is that whenever a cut scene happens the sound starts glitching really bad. Its still happening and the only way i can fix it is by deleting the game and installing it again eahc update,Positive
"Had to edit my positive review as the game has basically no content and even the advertised event is a joke. Other games wouldn't even call this event. I was hoping they learned from Genshin, but they just copy what they did there into a different playstyle. One would have hoped they learned from the rocky start, but I guess money is more important than delivering a good product.",Negative
"Absolutely amazing. Great characters, amazing visuals, and a fun storyline. Will say I prefer playing it on my PC though, since the larger screen enhances the visuals even more.",Positive
I am new to turn-combat based games but this one is pretty good. I can still wanna suggest if you wanna make it a bit smoother so low end device can be optimized. The log-in errors are still intact even I am in a strong internet. Hoping you will fix it.,Positive
"Just downloaded the app and now it stuck. I will uninstall it and then reinstall the app. Successfully reinstalled it. Playing it for a couple of minutes and the character I was using is stuck in game time. I was moving the character with no obvious goal and I inadvertently got stuck next to a plant. I could reinstall it again, but why bother since I'll have to go through the whole thing over again. This is for people who are already advanced in this type of rpg.",Negative
"It is a very nice game, it balances off with resources excellently. You can even get a free five star after just playing the game for 1 hour. It is very convenient to get a nice five star in the early game and building your team around it. If you are finding an RPG game which piques's your interest, happily try it out, you won't regret it!",Positive
"Absolutely wonderful cutscenes and story. Takes a little while to understand what's going on, but once you're in, it's super interesting to play the missions with all the lore behind it.",Positive
"Cool game. Even with low graphic setting it's still amazing. Although the size is remarkably big and it heats up my phone (not too much if I don't play continuously for more than 3 hours), don't worry, I'll root for this game. Keep up the good work, hoyo.",Positive
"overall the game is good but there is one problem and it's all about the optimization of the game, even though I have a d8100 processor it gets really hot even with medium graphics. I don't know if this is normal or need some optimization to fully enjoy the game.",Negative
"As a ex-Genshin Impact player from 1.0 until the middle of the Sumeru, I expect quality from Hoyoverse. They delivered quality and more for Honkai: Star Rail. To get it out of the way, predatory gacha elements are present; once again, I am not F2P because I'm am not lucky at all, and earning the currency will always feel too slow. Looking past that, however, the game is fast-paced, aesthetic, humorous, and with a fun game play. There's the good and bad, and I see so much of the good. For now.",Positive
"I love this game! The characters are awesome, the story is amazing and i love the gameplay. Of course, this is a turn based game so this game fits right up my ally. The side quests are fun to do and gaining jades is reasonable and being f2p is pretty decent. so yea i recommend trying the game if u like rpg turn based games.",Positive
"Very good and if i have to say what lacking is the huge ammount of storage it needed every new patch, but overall the gameplay os good, character design are good (but the xianzhou character design can be improved), story good, EN voice actors are very good (especially kafka, bronya, welt).",Positive
"Well, it's just horribly optimized for my device. First thing. Second thing, there are a few mistakes here and there. Minor spelling mistakes and such. For example... When changing servers, at the confirmation message. We get Sever instead of server. Literally couldn't play the game so not going to complaint about gameplay. Update: Reinstallation is a waste of internet and conditions same. Literally loads at 1Fps per minute",Negative
"This game is not accessible for visually impaired players. There are too much puzzles and tasks that require good eyesight to complete. Worst of all, so many story content and limited rewards are gated behind these puzzles and tasks. Meaning I usually got stuck in story mode and miss out on so many limited time rewards simply because the devs couldn't care less about making the game more accessible to low vision players.",Negative
"Good! The gameplay was fun, cool character design, and more. But i got a few problem, every cutscene are lagging / freeze and makes a robotic sound. It's pretty annoying so please fix it, thanks Hoyoverse!",Positive
"I went into this game wanting ""Genshin but without Genshin's flaws"" and got the opposite. Mihoyo games are best enjoyed a year or two after release when there's enough content that you feel like you can pick between dailies and story at will. Once you're through story content though, the game forces you into a state of upkeep. Settle on one team fast, or be prepared to become a slave to your dailies for the next few years. Can't recommend",Negative
It's a pretty fantastic game! I have noticed some other extremely stupid reviews. They are literally complaining about the game being turn based and giving it 2 stars for it. If you do not like turn based combat then why even bother Playing the game. And I would even say the game is not poorly optimised. You need a decent phone to play the game. Even a fishy looking game will lag on a weak phone.,Positive
"Ok you know what, I had very low expectations but let's get to the point. The game is very, very optimized both on mobile and PC. But more importantly, I find the story as well as the world setting particularly amazing. No more Paimon to talk over our MC and actually very engaging characters. You have to hand it to Mihoyo with how they deliver their games, it is very easy to fall in love with it. Also As far as the gameplay and gacha goes, I'll reserve my judgment until later. 10/10 game.",Positive
"As expected from MIHOYO, the Grahics are top notch. Storytelling of the game is good (but it might not be everyone's cup of tea) -- the pacing however is a moxed bag. Character Design is always the best that comes out of MIHOYO. Replayability is a hige YES, there are contents in the End Game that can keep you engaged with the game after clearing the Story Quests. Some of the Missions are all well written, witty, funny,and emotional. I hope the game will grow and blossom to something big!",Positive
Terrible rates and boring gameplay. Character rolls should be separate from card rolls. Feels like a total ripoff. And they barely give tickets away after the beginning. One of the most unrewarding gachas I have played. The graphics are good at least.,Negative
"Really appreciate Hoyo for making this game. The character designs are cool and very resembling their style across game titles (HI3, Genshin, Tear of Themis) while at the same time bringing up the old fashioned Turn-based playstyle which dated back way before other genre's were invented. Overall, this game is great for both old or new player and I encourage people who like all Hoyoverse's games and those who like Turn-based playstyle.",Positive
"I do have an issue with getting 5 star heroes but other than that the games pretty good and I am managing with the 4 stars I have. What I was given as 5 star heroes are not exactly helpful. I don't need 2 tanks (the protag, and some ice dude) and a healer. Except for the healer the tanks don't really have a spot in a line up. Btw I'm on world 3.",Positive
"Definitely a step up from Genshin Impact. I don't like comparing things often, but this DEFINITELY had me baffled. Don't even get me started about the gacha system. I always hated Genshin mostly because it was so hard to grind. It was like a pay to win type game. THIS however, makes things much easier. In fact, after I downloaded this, I downloaded Genshin! I really love the story as well. Keep up the amazing work üëè P.S. Blade üòç",Positive
"This game is fun. And I really wanted to love it. I'll give it props that at least compared to Genshin your fighting mechanical monsters and not people who look like tribal men. However, I am uninstalling. I'm not okay with Pela's character. I am not okay with character that looks so much like a child in an outfit similar to Zatanna. Can we please just have a fun game without the reminder that humans are ""thirsty"" gremlins?",Negative
"I understand its made by the same people as genshin, but its pretty much an exact copy in mechanics and user interface, the only real difference is the gameplay style. I've played games like this, but theres nothing Star Rail does better or really unique in comparison, apart from having better funding. If anything, it's less free player friendly, since the premium currency is more scarce. Along with the fact your gear needs dupilacates to reach x lvl, but in genshin you can level gear without.",Negative
I played a little in the beginning but it crashed and when I try to log back in it tells me there is a login error and it is super laggy try to launch the game but it had good graphics and game gameplay just wish it would actually work to play it,Negative
"Amazing, I love the interaction with the characters, the design including the layout and the amazing story stories!! I can't wait for more adventures and story in the following future!!! üíúüíúüíúüíúüíú",Positive
"üåå Played for several months today. All I could say is this is a beautiful game and the player can make good progress after battling, analyzing, and improving such characters based on the circumstances around you. Patience is key.",Positive
"So far so good! Significant QoL improvements since closed beta. The main critique you'll run into is that the combat system is shallow with ""only 2 skills"" per character. This is a false premise. Players who complain about simplicity have ignored the aspects of managing overworld skills, buff, debuff, and damage type interactions. Boss battles become increasingly complex as you play. It's a gacha. You can either brute force your way through content with a credit card, or you can PLAY the game.",Positive
"It's really overwhelming when you are gone from the game, then you come back, and there's like a million things you need to finish while there are many other events going on. Also the whole play style and and characters are kinda boring, like now that I realize it I feel like it was always boring from the start but nobody realized it because the game just came out and everyone was hyping it up and was different than many of your other games. Overall, not good but not bad",Negative
It's a increadible game not gona lie specially the graphics and gameplay.But I still would like some improvement in the droprate of trasis and level up material it's just a grind specially fo f2p.Dont make me talk about the relic exp it's hard to level up one to 15.But hey great game hope they keep up the good story and improve the game on the latter updates.,Positive
Player from day one here. Never ever I play a GACHA game and then still playing the game until now. The game is very generous with the reward and the endgame content really fun to challenge. The HSR community too really fun to hang out than the 'other' game. For those who like Turn Based game. Please try this game. It's fun and the daily challenge for Stellar Jade reward easy to complete like only take 5 minute of your time. It's really good for people who working & got less time to play.,Positive
"Just not as fun as Genshin for me, the chests blend with the scenery and resemble benches. Bumped up prices for welkins alternative and Battle Pass and a not as immersive story as Genshin's. But in general, it's a really great games as expected from Hoyo. And the turn based Combat felt very lack lustre to me (I preferred Persona 5 over this).",Negative
"The game is great but when I updated it, the walls and floors disappeared. I just came back to this game just to be greeted with this kind of issue. I admit that I'm using mobile phone to play but its not the problem, back then it's okay I can play smoothly. Please I'm begging you to fix this since I really want to play this game again.",Negative
"As someone who grew up playing FFVII, this is the closest I've had to matching that in game player experience. I can't believe that this is a mobile game! Graphics are gorgeous as well. Just wonderful to run around in.",Positive
"Can't skip cut scenes so spend hours watching pointless videos, tones & tones of non-skipable reading, when u run then stop u slide across floor having to run back to stuff constantly, repeatedly reminded how to do things in fights despite been told 5mins ago. Whoever made this should be shot",Negative
"The Graphics in this game is amazing! I like the Story and Turn Based gameplay Style, The Characters design is so Unique and Beautiful I like Bronya's design, <3 I also like how Every Character has their own unique story and personality :> Bladie and Silverwolf is my Favorite characters so far. I hope many people play or give this game a try especially if they played Honkai Impact 3rd +(‚Å†‚ó†‚Å†‚Äø‚Å†„Éª‚Å†) I know you won't regret it, Fight for all that's Beautiful in the world!",Positive
"The game is a great game to take your time with and doesn't require spending money. If you have issues with gambling, don't touch it. Otherwise, have fun with the turn based combat. Also, ignore the low reviews from Genshin fans mad they didn't get better rewards.",Positive
It's a good game but the reason that I don't give it a full stars is that the game need to be optimized for example when I login the game runs smooth but when I fight couple boss the frames goes down from 40 fps to 20 or 25 or sometimes 15 i was thinking this could fix 1.1 update but it didn't and we now entering 1.3 so please slove this problem,Positive
"It's a good one, but the major drawback is the combat mechanism.. It doesn't feels fluid and is more like a cutscene, which disrupts the immersion Honkai Impact 3rd is a better one, if you want something to play alongside Genshin Impact",Negative
"It runs so well... The game is great too, it takes some time to pick it up because of the tutorials. But the combat is quite free flowing for turn based.",Positive
"Could not get into Genshin even with multiple tries, but this game hooked me instantly. Characters are likable and interesting with a pretty good stories. Love the turn base combat and it made farming for items easier with auto play. Have sunk in a 100 hours so far and still going strong.",Positive
"Amazing game and absolutely great service! I got the game when it came out but I then uninstalled it for storage, later I reinstalled it but I couldn't get my account so I emailed them and they got it all fixed in less than an hour!",Positive
"I'm really disappointed about the first release, like I've been downloading it since yesterday and it's still not done!! It's because, it's always force closing while I'm still downloading the resources for no reason and it's really annoying as hell!! I really hope you can fix or something.. I'm really looking forward to play this game but it's so lag, and it's always Force closing.. Unlike genshin and honkai impact 3, please just fix this issue!!",Negative
I'm starting to think this game is full of BS. I play games to ENJOY. But sometimes the instructions to the puzzles are too hard and confusing that I simply quit the game. Shame. I liked the graphics and game play.,Negative
"I'm not a fan of reviews, but I can confidently say that this game is lit! Graphics is good and I definitely love the turn base gameplay. The storyline is a mix of hit and miss, nevertheless, this game would definitely be one of the greatest release for android",Positive
"The game soooo gooddd!!! I like it so much, Im obsessed with it!! I play it everyday never got bored. This game so good and the concept, the storyline, the feature, the characters, their unique skill and design, and etc is very very good!!",Positive
"Adventuring around the different planets and questes keep you on your toes on the next adventure, easy to navigate and noob friendly puzzles to get chests, stellar jades are pretty easy to get as there are tons of achievements overall very fun",Positive
"I loves playing rpg games, so naturally I'd love this game too. The graphics are gorgeous, the bgms are really great, and storyline is pretty good currently. Dialogue isnt too boring because theres some humor option every now and then. This really brings back the rpg era, except it comes in a gacha form which is... Pretty bad for rpg game (gacha means itll be never-ending but rpg game need to be completed to feel its charm). If you like genshin AND rpg game well, try it out",Positive
"After the 1.2 update the game has been lagging even on my PC too, which can run the game at 60fps 1080 it is just frustrating that I had to play very low and it still hits around 25 fps on PC, now on phone I'm having the same issue like on pc. Maybe this is just an optimization issues so I'm hoping that the issue will be fixed...",Negative
"10/10 experience from the gameplay so far, very smooth movements fighting. But sometimes the cutscene get glitches, understandable since it's new hopefully it gets fixed soon.",Positive
I really enjoy this game! I was hesitant to play this at first because I don't really like turn based games but I was surprised at how engaging the gameplay is as well as the amazing storyline. I love how the main character has actual 'character' and is not just a silent insert. I really appreciate all the qol's put into the game. Thank you! Will definitely playing more.,Positive
"This game is an absolute blast to play, the sci-fi setting is great, the entire game's world is extremely immersive and the lore goes very deep. The concept with the different galactic gods is so cool. The writing in this game is phenomenal, it gives off undertale vibes with it's comedy while also being able to pull off dramatic and suspenful scenes very well. The combat is surprisingly good, I was dismayed at first because it was turn based but it surprised me. Overall an amazing game.",Positive
"What can i say, this is easily the best game of the year so far, amazing story and voice acting, great combat, loads to do so you wont get bored, alot of time and effort went into this game and it shows, id recommend everyone to play through this masterpeice of a game.",Positive
"Phenomenal turn based game with engaging story. Graphics look incredible for a mobile game, I've already played for about 65 hours and I show no signs of slowing down. I don't game on mobile but it's surprised me. Looking forward to the PS5 version!",Positive
really good game with captivating story. Game play is straightforward with a little bit of planning and timing of skills to break the opponent. They are also quite generous with rewards. Will recommend!,Positive
"When I try to log in the train in the back of the loading screen is gone and when I can finally log in to my account and play everything(the walls, the floors) disappears its really annoying. can you please help me? I really don't want to redownload everything and I also don't want to lose my account.üò¢",Negative
Fun game its my fav. Im just here for a problem its not really gameplay wise problem its just that right now any idle animation for some reason dont work both on camera and while waiting the idle doesnt work on thr camera its just says inneed to move on a spacios place but no matter where i go it doesnt work especially on my picture spot.,Positive
"Mediocre combat,abysmal exploration and side quests,looks unpolished,like a genshin reskin, better, yet still mediocre.As a huge turn based combat games enjoyer I can assure you if you're looking for a challenging combat you wont find it here. It's a numbers game. The moment you encounter higher level enemy- go farm the abysmally repetitive side quests til you catch up. The writing and voice acting is where the game shines. It's leagues ahead of genshin. Overall an improvement but still mid.",Negative
"Not a bad game for a turn based game, however I was hopeful it was another open world game like some of their other releases. Still better than Raid, Summoners War, or most other turn based games I've played, so I'll likely check it out more later when I'm in the mood for one of these games. For now I'll stick to open world",Positive
"Game is hard to run even on a top spec phone so don't expect your A12 to handle this game, everything about the game is good but just that nothing fantastic but quite solid. Would appreciate better phone temperature optimizations and faster combat speed up options, but all in all worth your 7GB of download space. Also to all those complaining their device doesn't work, learn how to read. Minimum and recommend specs are listed for a reason Don't low star rate a game just because you're too broke",Positive
"So damn gooood.. well worth the wait... I was never into turn based games, but wow! It's so fun! ..gets challenging too.. the stories and humor in exploration is top tier.. aswell aswell as graphics and gameplay.. fully recommend",Positive
"Its way boring than I thought,,,,,after completing everything there is nothing except worst daily commission which is not enjoyable at all, what's the point of having auto turn based animations in game ,so boring I just quit it already, though genshin is content less but it's the best , I give 2 stars for character designs and voice, and rest are boring, can u please just increase the content in Genshin? It will be more successful than HSR",Negative
"Quintessential JRPG experience, great localization, great voice acting, incredible story, and fun combat system! Characters have so much personality and lots of the 4 stars feel great to use. The pace of events and additional content is great as well",Positive
"I really love this game, there isn't any bugs or problems I've had with it. I think the game should have temp events that you can earn things. I love the characters I hope the game can have more",Positive
"It's flashy... but overall, you're not doing much but seeing the same animations over and over again. I mean, there are many ways to boost this and that but in the end, you're just seeing the same thing over and over again. There is not enough depth in it for me and the gacha already screams punishment!",Negative
"This HAS to be one of the best games I've played. The characters are amazing! Especially Dan Heng ü•∞. So are the graphics, I can admire Dan Hengü•∞ with such ease! The storyline is pretty interesting and for once I actaully can relax while playing this game. Very reccamended!",Positive
"Love the game but I keep getting a bug in my character screen where the background is totally pink, sometimes even when I use dan heng's skill. Thought it was weird for a game design until my friend told me they didn't have it at all.",Positive
"Great game, do not compare this to genshin impact. It is not genshin impact at all it is very much its own thing. Has the style of genshin that's it. A lot of people are being real picky about this game for no reason. It's great, it's funny with interesting characters and a nice storyline. Very much storyline focused so you'll be doing a lot of running around but it's still fun, don't avoid the game cos of 1 star reviews cos someone said ""it's not like genshin"" these people are childish",Positive
"Firstly it's a turn based game so that's maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but if you're willing to get over it, you'll really going to enjoy it's amazing story(a big step up from genshin) offering a more likeable MC and a great cast of crew with their own quite well written backstory, the best way to put it is it knows when to take itself seriously and when it's a comedy, oh yeah and the soundtracks... ""We've made a choice go fight against you're FATEEEEE!!!!!!"" simply perfect",Positive
"It's a great game of course, as the developer is hoyo . And I enjoy it quite a lot. But lately I'm having issues with the graphics I tried to fix it but it isn't working. But it is just a great game , everything is captivating.",Positive
"Honkai: Star Rail to my surprise has been genuinely some really good fun. As someone that didn't like Genshin, and adores Impact 3rd it genuinely won me over. The combat is fun and satisfying, allowing for some deep and rewarding strategies despite its simple facade. The writing of the game is fun as well, it has a very deep lore but the star of the show is the genuinely funny writing. The music is also pretty good, it has some decent tracks and has some stellar ones here and there.",Positive
"Its not genshin impact, but it was never marketed as such Its definitely more a honkai game than genshin That being said, I love this game just as much. The characters are incredibly likable and the fights are so much fun. The animations and character designs are so polished. It rly just feels like a passion project hoyoverse put together, with all the narrator interactions in the overworld and all I love this game and highly recommend it",Positive
"The game looks great, pretty free to play friendly, and the story is enjoyable alongside the music and the characters, and their designs are top tier and haven't gone down since the start of the game",Positive
"It's unexpectedly good for a turn base game. Characters, stories, music, design, everything is just so beautiful and they also add a lot of humour and reference into the game.",Positive
"Beautiful graphics, very deep and engaging turn-based combat mechanics. My only complaint would be the lack of any real sandbox elements and the long cutscenes/dialogue.",Positive
"Amazing game but ever since the update came all the backgrounds went missing. In the express the overall train is missing and the backgrounds is just stars an a planet, belobog's buildings went missing and the background is just a sky and herta's spaceship Is just stars the whole ship is missing. Pls fix üôèüèª",Negative
"Honestly, the only turn based game I have ever enjoyed. I decided to try this game out because I'm a long time genshin player so I thought ""I usually hate turn based games but it's from hoyo so I may as well try it"" with my expectations low, I went into the game expecting to not enjoy it and quit after an hour or 2 but I got hooked by the story and characters, I love this game.",Positive
"I am currently thinking of saving for Kafka or Blade, but nonetheless, I love the game There are some bosses that are perhaps difficult to go through. However, with the right team and tactics, it's easy to get through. Like March 7th and Dan Heng has been carrying me for a whole while. I do hope there are easier ways to get stellar jades, though.",Positive
"Good game, I love the characters, the play style is ok, but it still need some improvement with the gameplay and I also have an issue with the loading screen it's lagging every time I open the game",Negative
"Honestly hard to complain about the game. Might get power creepy, but so far every 5 star unit is still useful. If you aren't a turn based fan, then may not be your thing. Fairly generous for a Gacha and the managers and devs really seem to want to make the game the best it can be... Unlike MHY's previous major game. Good characters, story is hit or miss",Positive
"It's good i love this game as a pass time after playing genshin, But i wish that they could give an option to remove the animation of their ultimate skill, and it's too laggy even if you lower the graphics and it crashes frequently",Negative
"Great gameplay, great story, easy to play. Devs are quite generous, so it is f2p friendly eventhough being p2w or low spenders would make up ur progress faster. The end game content is quite difficult but not impossible to beat. So far i found that in every patch there's always major update to the event contents, features, and bug fixes. I hope HSR would countinuously be improved and ofcourse be more fun!",Positive
"I am surprised how Star Rail was able to maintain a 4.3 star rating. The game moves at a snail pace. The battles are mundane. The characters are forgettable. You can't do anything in cities. They just feel too artificial. It's sad really, where you could've made a much better game if you hadn't recycled everything from Genshin Impact.",Negative
"I'll take it as a five star! hsr doesn't took so much storage. although maybe in future updates, it will be more heavier. hoyo, you did an amazing job with the characters and storyline. I love the storyline so much. unfortunately, I have a slightly problem. hsr lags so much, more than honkai impact 3rd and genshin. I may have quit some of hoyo games, but hsr lags more. Im looking forward for another update versions. thank you hoyo for making this game! please keep doing this magnificent work!",Positive
"App is unoptimized for Samsung. I have a pretty decent a52s and the downloading resources, although i set the app to unrestricted, fails every time I put the app in the background. It's just the worst. It fails every 300MB of resources downloaded.",Negative
"I like the game graphic and design, but the only struggle i have in game is character materials such as exp,credit and traces materials, please add difficulty VI and VII for golden calyx and difficulty VII for crimson calyx. I've heard rumours about increase trailblazer power in the future idk if its true or not but i hope it is.",Negative
"Great base game. But content updates have been lackluster and too short. Sad to see potential story plots compromised with extremely basic ones, just like Fatui being behind all bad events in Genshin--in other words, predictable and uninspired writing. Powercreep is too real this early into the game as every limited unit so far dwarves the previous. HOWEVER, Quality of Life Updates team truly deserves praise with every update they make. Maybe they'll ship out good content once QoL is all patched",Negative
"Great game, but when I linked my Facebook to use the account on my PC, it deleted all my progress. I didn't ever screenshot anything, so I don't have access to my user ID. Turns out that if you can't access that, you can't get your profile back. It sucks because I was having a ton of fun on it, but what a waste of time now. The support team couldn't help either because of the missing ID, even though I gave plenty of info stating my name on there, what specific things I had, etc.",Negative
It was a good game but it take times to build characters. It takes a lot of time. You can't even defeat a boss from a quest if you only have a few characters. I've been repeating a certain boss for how many time already to the point that I'll just give up since can't defeat it and can't continue the story.,Negative
"I play on mobile and they have this log in error that happens for literally no reason, not to mention in this update i can't log in for no reason for long periods of time and even when i do manage to log in, nothing renders and everything is glitchy and laggy before it eventually just crashes, customer service is basicslly useless and doesn't provide any fixes, FIX THIS PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU",Negative
"I played a lot of Turn Based RPG titles all over my life like Final Fantasy, Shin Megami Tensei, Fire Emblem, Dragon Quest and So much more And all I can say is Honkai Star rail is one of the best I evered played. Its just so gorgeous and fun to play. yeah played genshin before but This one is way so much different this is better. I played for a like a hour long without noticing! You guys deserve the Game of the year for 2023!!!",Positive
"If you went into this game expecting it to be like an open world game and are mad that it doesn't have the features of an open world game you're an idiot and there's absolutely no hope for you. This game is turn-based so it's vastly different from Genshin. However, I'm having a lot of fun with it and have been playing non-stop since launch! The writing, characters, and team building is my favorite part so far.",Positive
The app has a lot of problems since 1.1 update. Couldn't login via the app the first week. Able to login on 2nd week but game keeps crashing when trying to do Calyx. (Crashed at screen crack load-in) It's annoying me.,Negative
"The game is fun, but the gotcha system is horrible like all games from this company. They are also very greedy when it comes to giving out free resources and don't reward people who pay. That again is like every game from this company. The art, music, and voice acting are all good, so that's a plus. I wouldn't say any game from this company can be a 5 star game in my book",Negative
"This is a great game and i reccomend it to people who just want to play and enjoy a rpg gacha game casually and to hardcore gamers aswell.My only complaintes is that it can be difficult to aquire stellar jade,5 star characters are also hard to get due to rates and its mussing a jump mechanic.Some other issues are related to performance issues and other such things like cutscenes stuttering on mid-lower end devices",Positive
Beyond amazing visuals with characters in a turn based setting and a very well designed story. The music is top notch and the character designs are very stylized keeping you wanting more. This takes the best aspects of Honkai Impact and Genshin impact [interestingly implementing improving wanted in Genshin within Honkai Starrail instead]. The team definitely shows some promise with making the game dialogue entertaining and free of the dialogue bloat that wastes your time from Genshin.,Positive
"Loving the game so far. Saw so many reviews of the game being so laggy but come one what do you expect with a big upcoming game? millions of people are playing the game at the same time on LAUNCH DAY!! Of course it would be laggy but not as bad as some games I've played. And some people complaining about their phone not supporting the game, it's not the games fault if you're phone can't support a top notch game. But anyway so far good story, awesome graphics, and good gameplay.",Positive
The game is beautiful and really fun and also very f2p friendly. Only issue is that in some areas the floor glitches out and when I teleport to the train it randomly spawns me outside the map and I have to respawn to fix it.,Positive
"Absolutely love it, it's only been out for a short while now, but so far I'm so happy with the characters, game mechanics, and content that is constantly being updated. I'm coming over from Genshin Impact, but I've seen how in HI3 they have multiple forms of the same character, I'm excited to see how that might translate to HSR. I hope we get a progressively older Bailu with different paths. I extremely want Vidyadhara and other cool alien species waifus,I'm excited to see what else is in store!",Positive
"It has brought the quality of genshin impact without a lot of the tedium. There is still some tedium. Like not being able to quickly skip dialogue. I am not here for the story, sorry. I just want to get to the gameplay.",Positive
"Unplayable on mobile, I can't even get past the tutorial on the domains because of the quakes, my game would crash everytime it triggered. Basically unplayable. And yes I am playing on the lowest quality.",Negative
It's a great game if you are a fan of turn base or like playing Final fantasy games. I can compare the gameplay from the Final Fantasy when you encounter Enemies from It's map zone. I find it enjoying to play.,Positive
"It's an awesome game but sometimes I get a random black screen after a battle, I'm not sure what that is but.. It's a little annoying that I have to reload the game every time that happens. Other than that, wonderful.",Positive
"People don't understand how this game is basically the best mobile RPGs of all time, the story line is makes you want more, the characters and their backstory are captivating, and just the overall gameplay is fun and challenging. That doesn't mean it's a perfect game though, I have a few suggestions like instead of having a max of 6 in the material warps, why not have a max of 12? 24? Those are better for farming fr more materials especially books and credits.",Positive
"Loving the take Hoyoverse has taken into Honkai: Star Rail. With the game being new, the diversity of the characters and in-game lore has really immersed me into the universe of Honkai: Star Rail. The game doesn't get petty with dishing out rewards. Power creep in these kinds of games is inevitable although it saddens me that the power creep in Honkai: Star Rail is really evident, making previously featured characters almost/completely useless had not built properly to accomodate.",Positive
Ok I like the game but I hate the gameplay. Fighting sucks,Negative
"Again, same thing as Genshin Impact. The cutscenes almost always lag, and don't work. My previous review said that when the game first came out, the frame rates dropped and the game stuttered.. It looks like it's been fixed? But why are the cutscenes still lagging, especially the trailblazing train take-off cutscene? It's been months now? The game is great, amazing content, so interesting, you never get bored. But why? If it's a good game why keep such grievances still in place way after release",Negative
"The game is very good and its really f2p friendly, and i love the lore aswell but the problem is the Laggy Cutscenes, I play smoothly and the dialogue are smooth but its just the cutscenes the stuttering so bad, using Low Graphics dont fix it aswell, i see that alot of players experience this issue aswell and i hope the devs fix it, i wanna watch a cutscene without going to Youtube, (Edit) Plus the ghost event its so hard i cant farm the stellar jades, im stucked at that fu xuan mission....",Negative
"This game is good, but i don't know why Mihoyo games tend to be like this (same thing happend to me with Genshin Impact). This game doesn't have the same ""hook"" effect as games like Guardian Tales, or Arknights for me (mainly i play then for gameplay, collection and story). For me personally, I feel like this game lacks something that keeps me wanting to play.. I just lazily burn stamina, while not putting effort into Forgotten Hall contents (memory of chaos etc) despite it being time limited.",Negative
I love the game very much but one thing I don't really like is that it's limited to only a few platform. I can't download it on my phone since it's not suit for my phone and I can't play it on my ps4 since hoyo only added it on ps5. It's a very awesome game but I just wish that they can add it on ps4 thats all,Positive
"Overall this game is very enjoyable until you hit Tb 60 there no much to do but it's totally fine we are still in 1.0 the same thing happened in genshin 1.0 so let's wait for more content. The game is extremely F2p, the story is amazing, dialogues funny and the ost is insane especially during a certain boss fight I won't spoil. You lose nothing trying this game so try it you won't regret it and if I could say one advice about the game, don't rush it take your time it it would be more enjoyable",Positive
"I enjoy playing this game and I really like the animations and graphics. I have a suggestion that if we use auto mode, can we set the characters skills that can be used while in auto mode so it can follow our preferred strategy",Positive
"this game is pretty fun, i enjoy the characters and the story. but the problem is that this game have a difficult build and actually is hard to be understandable for me. so i need to look up for tutorials on yt and still confused even tho I've already play this game for 1 month",Positive
"The game is good, but not for mobile players. It will fry even the newest phones on anything above low graphics and for 2.0 in particular the game keeps on crashing before the update is done and I can't even access it. Please fix this issue guys, I'd like to get my daniel heng.",Negative
"This game is probably the one of the worst games I have played so wish wise. I love the characters and the story but the Gacha system is so God awful. The pulls get worse and worse sadly. When I finally partially catch up to farm harder content, the relic system rolls get worse afterwards. I don't want insane luck like everyone but after having trash luck since the game's release, it gets tiresome.",Negative
"Playing alone is quite lonely sometimes, if it's possible I would like to suggest to add co-op mode soon, even though it's different from Genshin. It would be nice to play real time with friends, such as do Calyx and Chest hunting. Overall It's really is a great game, not to mention it's free.",Positive
"Amazing like actually. This game is like if Persona, Final Fantasy, and Genshin had a child. It is a ton easier to get wishes/warps in this so if that was your reason for not liking genshin, here is this. The game is also much liner, so if you felt overwhelmed with genshin then this is a good alternative. Music is great as always (Hoyomix) And it's everything you loved about Genshin but better. Also Kafka ‚ù§, thats all imma say",Positive
"First of this is a turn-base sci-fi game, and with that being said i can honestly say its awesome.. different pace from Genshin (same company made them) and just like Genshin you can finish the whole game without the premium characters and not have to spend a dime.. the featured unit gotcha (while having no pity, has very good 4* units). I play this everyday and can't wait for the ps5 version (announced) to drop later this year. Very good going devs.. from locations to story, all top notch.",Positive
"This game is what changed my mind when it comes to turn based games like this. I've been a fan of Hoyoverse games (A certified genshin player), and this game keeps up to the standard that I expect. I used to think that I will not last for a long time playing this game since I'm used to rather open world with open world combat ( HSR has some open world exploration to be fair). But this, while turn based, bring something new and feels really polished. Keep it up Hoyoverse!",Positive
"Really good game. Awesome places with puzzle, god dame reward, ok story, so much content (Genshin could never). Only problem is storage idk why 2.0 update took 13 GB with already taking 15 GB. Could add a way to remove previous quest and cut scene.",Positive
"Every time theres an update coming and when i havent updated or opened my star rail, its keep showing black screen ! And it keeps saying it wont respond as well. Its so annoying that i had to redownload it again and it will be normal again, please fix this, specially for low specs player users ‚òπÔ∏è",Negative
"It's a nice game on the go and playing at home. I usually play it on the phone while I'm at work and when I'm at home, I use the PC launcher to play it on the desktop. Very generous with their jades than genshin's gems since they have Simulated 225 and then the 600 of mirror. Another way to get tickets to pull on standard banner. Just wished they had a count for pulls until soft/hard pity like HI3 does instead of having to count for them through history.",Positive
"What is wrong with you..?? After the last update, the game doesn't even open, even when I have high speed data, it shows error codes.. I can't even log into it now.. I loved this game so much.. and now it won't even let me log in.. I am a f2p player.. and Missing the daily log ins is hurtful for me.. do something about it..!!",Negative
Overall I'm enjoying this game alot. BUT when it comes to the storyline like the cutscenes. I get lagging so bad like per frame but other thing still going smoothly. (I hope you can fix this)(yes my phone can handle this it's just lag whenever cutscenes play's),Positive
"Honestly, I didn't think I would caught up to this game after i was burned out of playing genshin. But to my surprise, this game is just freaking AMAZING! Majestic characters, good combat system, tons of free rewards including artifacts(relics) and lightcones(weapons), a free 5star character in 50 pulls, the game devs listening to the community, and a 240 resin update wth?! Overall this game is just amazing, would recommend playing it if you want to play a casual game.",Positive
"objectively speaking, overall good game with good mechanics. it has a decent story that can be captivant if one played the francise on honkai. as personal experience, this is one of the worst game i have played. not my genre and it can be a lot improved to be a proper gatcha game.",Negative
"Honestly all this game needs is more content and more ways to give players who want it more stuff to do and grind. I'd like to see aside from the gacha characters maybe 1 character a month you could grind something to unlock, if the others are all in the gacha to kind of reward active players. But the art, story, combat and animations, and overall polish of this game really are second to none right now. Just need more stamina or more modes that dont require stamina to earn rewards in my opinion",Positive
"Fun turn based game with good graphics and a decent story, but the game is just like any other gacha game with huge time gates and need for RNG for progression farther into the ""endgame content"" of the game. Levelling up all of your characters to a place where they are usable in that content can take weeks if not months... Be prepared to spend a lot of time grinding on this game.",Positive
"This game is actually really good and so is the good story. What is pissing me off is no matter how many Jade I get to pull for specific character that is going right now I am getting every character but the characters are showing, in my personal opinion you should have a higher chance of getting the character that they're showing for your pull over any other. Pulling for the character that they're showing and getting other five stars is really annoying. I want the 5 star that they are showing.",Negative
"I love how the developers actually listen to the community, a five star review is an understatement. The gameplay is fun and delivers on what it promises. The music, voice acting and the visuals are amazing. I usually don't leave many reviews, but star rail deserves it.",Positive
"It's an amazing game! I think I enjoy it more than I do genshin, but that doesn't mean I don't like genshin. Sorry, that was probably off topic, but it's graphics and art style is fantastic, I'm sadly a mobile player so I may run out of storage soon:(. But anyway, I hope you enjoy the game as much as I do!!<3 -Butters",Positive
"Honestly I love this game but it's really annoying, it not fair that the enemys get to strike us 2 times and the character that I chose always dies first and its really annoying but I guess there's nothing you can do about it.",Positive
"Long time player. Just using the $4.99 monthly pass and nothing else. Maxed out many characters, relics, Trees, completed endgame content, always had enough to pull roughly √ó70 times during events. Their events rate for unique characters is definitely broken. Will burn you out once you have to collect resources for endgame gear, character level up, skill trees, ect for every character that would be essential to help advance later on on updates.",Negative
"The game is good, the combat system is satisfying (at least for me), but I have hard time just trying to log in, it kept saying error password even though I changed a few times already, so I deleted the game until they fix this issue",Negative
"The game is really fun, but the story is lacking. I adore the fighting mechanism. It reminds me of persona 5 in a way. Which is one of the reasons I like it so much. I'm looking forward to more story updates, though. It left off on a pretty big cliffhanger :(",Positive
"Overall,this game is must to play...and team composition and turn based game.well I'm playing this game from the first phase(jing yuan) I just missed one phase (blade,the character I personally like)..I really want him..I have 72 pulls with 17 pity(guaranteed)..I just hope A blade rerun.I hope hoyoverse will not disappoint me.At the last this game is the best rpg game you will found on Play Store. it's graphics,burst, animation all are well created. especially the characters.Blade rerun pls!",Positive
"Overall I really like the game, a turn-based rpg, coming from genshin, is very fresh and fun, nice character design, and amazing story, but because of all the crashing and freezing I couldn't get into the game.",Positive
Game is basically a novel. Good story writing. But game play is just the same old thing. Then stop and more talking and waffle waffle waffle chat chat chat. Same as Genshin impact a whole ton of chatting. If you have time to sit down and read the mountain of text it's pretty good. Character design is amazing and voice acting is brilliant. It's a cool game overall. I enjoy more action when playing mobile games. When it comes out on the ps5 I'll download and play.,Negative
"It's much more f2p friendly that genshin, but if you want the best experience playing on the computer is the better choice. But if you're a mobile player with a pretty good phone or tablet then go for it! My computer is just the better choice for me",Positive
"I can't begin to describe how in love with this game I am. From its graphics to its gameplay loop. Everything I'd satisfying. The only complaint I have is that, like with other gacha games, it gets to a point after a while where grinding becomes impossible without waiting for a while, which is okay. I can't wait to see how the game continues to develop.",Positive
"As someone who grew up playing turn-based games, this is a modern take of the genre with gacha. The story is top-notch. Intriguing, dramatic, fun and it's sci-fi! I also like that the characters look mature compared to Genshin, which looks like a kid's game with their character design. Maybe that's why I enjoy Honkai Star Rail a lot more than when I tried GI. And there's no Paimon! Pom-pom and March 7th are what you need. And MC talks too, and a very usable unit till late game not just tutorial.",Positive
"The writing in this game is incredible. The amount of detail in every interaction, the humor, how sassy the MC is....very well done. Gameplay has a classic feel, which I like, and you aren't pushed to grab the banners, unlike many other gatcha games. A very pleasant experience, can't wait to learn more about this interesting world!",Positive
"Really fun for an rpg and character designs are well done. Story also good aswell. side quest, don't care for but it's a way to get in game currency. Events are also well done and a good way to get things you need. My only issue is the trablazer power...you get to little and it take 24 hrs to reset which ik sorta normal. you can maybe farm a few pieces of gear and thats it unless you wanna spend the currency...Maybe give us a way to increase overall daily trailblazer power or decrease costs.",Positive
"Fun turn based game, lots of RPG elements and a great story with wonderful cast members. Even the side quests memorable. They fixed the energy problems and the endgame is absolutely a banger.",Positive
"The game is fun. The mechanics are interesting and not as stressful as fastpaced games. But it glitches on my device when warp/wish, its just a black screen and i cannot see what i got. I hope it gets fixed",Negative
"Just like Genshin impact, star rail is all flare with very little substance. You are basically only playing this because you like the story of your like the characters. The addictiveness of the gameplay is pretty much done by the end of the first major boss fight. The only thing this game has going for it is the bigger than average budget for a gacha game. I would recommend not dumping money into this game because it's going to suffer the same fate as genshin once the flashy new-ness is gone.",Negative
Again another amazing game made by this company and again I cannot give it a perfect score because it is still using gacha mechanic a mechanic that clearly messes with how much you'll enjoy the game I don't understand why they don't try another way to fund their games I would rather pay for the game and pay for skins or other forms of content but not the characters and certainly not for things that affect the gameplay.,Negative
"It's a fun game with a neat story until the micro transaction aspect of it completely destroys the flow. Before you know it you have a thousand different random things to do with no real way of discerning a best course of action, other than consulting forum advice, and everything you try to do is beyond your recommended group level. Nothing I hate more than playing a game that constantly reminds me about real world money. I play games to forget about that so I moved on to other games.",Negative
This game is just so addicting. The story is so in depth except maybe luofu main story. The character designs might be repetitive at some times but they still make it interesting. And there is so much quality of life changes every update! And in the recent update they made a new endgame content that made old characters that were considered bad effective again. The rewards actually feels like youre in a dream job (unlike genshin). I hope you keep doing what you are doing hsr devs!,Positive
I seen it won game award last year and decided to check it out and surprise I had fun it feel more like a actual rpg game I'd play on console but free and that another thing it not you have to grind forever to move up a few levels it's actual pretty good characters story leveling I never was a fan of turn based jrpg but this game I made a exception,Positive
"Gameplay are good, Visual is stunning, Story are so much happened to process, still no skip cutscene after playing for 8 month, some skippable but didnt anything, game is really hard for casual player and F2P didn't farm that much, and really have problem picking a character for random situation, Overall 6/10 for me",Negative
I really enjoy the story and turn based combat. To me it's the closest I'll get to a Gacha Persona game on mobile. The game and combat is very pretty and the story is much less bland because all the main story quests are fully voiced. The grind could get worse later on but that all depends on how hardcore of a player you are. For a casual turn based enjoyer this game is a treat. For in-depth reviews of lategame and the grind I'd look up a video instead of relying on playstore reviews.,Positive
"I've been playing this since a few days after launch. Been playing it almost daily since then. The grind is far less draining than in Genshin, it's so much easier to get gacha currency, and the various weekly game modes are SO much fun. I love being able to set up a domain battle and just let it battle for me in the background while I do chores. The only complaint I have is that character diversity is very lacking, but this is Hoyoverse, so that's unfortunately to be expected I guess.",Positive
"Make no mistake, this is just as predatory as Genshin Impact. It requires a large amount of storage, but I see why. The main thing I would change, is to make the roll chances for five star characters 50 percent higher than the chances for five star light cones in the normal banner. After getting to pity five times, four of those were light cones. I understand the pity system. I understand the rules, so no need to post a cookie cutter response, developer. Just simply listen, and improve.",Negative
"Good game, but for some reason the smart developers decided to release the pc client and not allow for the gamers to link Google play to the pc client to cross play. Real smart. I hope they fix this. 2 star for now. Overall good game, terrible gacha rates as expected though, great character design, good story, voice acting is great, lots to do, not stamina locked at least notbyet from what I've played. Would be a 4 star but I can't link the pc client to Google play. Till a fix. It's 2 stars.",Negative
"Great game it's the first gacha that I spent money just because the game play is actually really good. Not only that they took previous mechanics from their previous game (Genshin Impact) and improved them by so much, there is much to do at the endgame and it's actually challenging. All in all I would definitely absolutely recommend this for gacha game beginners.",Positive
"Very good game, just 1 thing, add the option to skip cinematics, dialogs, and everything. A lot of people don't care about the story because its just a generic cliche anime story, we only care on the gameplay, so plz add an skip feature",Positive
"Seeing people giving this game 1 star makes me laugh. üòÇ Like seriously if you can't purchase a good phone or can't afford a good data plan to play this game, how the hell is it even the game developers fault?? It seriously puzzles me. Also those that are comparing this game with genshin needs to stop. This is obviously a different style game, you don't like it that is your problem, it is NOT the game developers problem. Just play the game and comment on the gameplay itself thank you. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",Positive
3 stars for now. I hate that you can't skip the story/cutscene. The tutorial alone took me an hour or so lol. It should be an option whether we want to sit there for hours while watching them talking or just skip it altogether. Not to mention the absence of a selective summon. It's 2023 already and you're still stingy about 1 ssr unit? Time to go back to Outerplane i guess,Negative
"Absolutely love the game and am now playing it so much,love the little changes and updates over Genshin. Though there are still some bugs like in Genshin where you can't hear the characters dialogue in the missions except for in the main story Also dissatisfied with the lack of jump feature.",Positive
"This game is incredible and i love it so much! I love the gameplay and how everything works and also the graphics of the game is really good üíØ! but sometimes the game lags but i know it's my own problem bcuz of my device lol;-; But, i still love it and i can't take wait for more updates and new characters to come!",Positive
"Ever since the 2.0 update, the game crashes every 30 seconds or so. I tried restarting my phone, reinstalling the game, and changing my setting (before the game crashes) and nothing is working. My device is a S23 FE and there is literally 0 problem before this. Please help fix this asap",Negative
"This game is incredibly fun. If you like anime, and pokemon, you will love this game, because it's a turn based simulator with anime characters instead of pokemon... That said, it's super F2p friendly, you can reliably pull a limited 5 star once per patch of you do your quests and claim your free stellar jade... We also get a free 10 pull every patch. Can't recommend it enough!",Positive
"A disappointing game that might have come out to be a solid turn based game if they didn't shoehorn every genshin system. From gatekeeping character mechanics within dupes, the ""not weapon"" cone banner, and artifact system; thanks to this legendary trifecta of terrible systems you can kiss goodbye to proper balancing and tailored encounters. Unless you're horribly unlucky then the game is a cake walk and any extra power from dupes and artifacts is only useful so you can fully auto the game.",Negative
Anything decent about this game is completely overshadowed by the predatory gacha system. It's the worst out of any game I've ever played. The combat gets dull with only one ability to choose from and the story is incredibly short. Not a lot of content when you expect thousands per character. It's ridiculous how predatory games have become with gambling like this and it's because of players like asmon with more money than brains that they're the way they are.,Negative
"The game is amazing. The storyline writing is great and the quests aren't too long and really worth it. It would be nice if the pulls per character wouldn't be that lot. Overall, great game! Definitely keep y'all's writers here with you guys. I expect more well written lore so on from othe planets coming soon:D",Positive
the gameplay gets too difficult too quickly and sometimes the difficulty will ramp up without any warning and you'll hit a brick wall. sometimes even when your past the suggested team level you'll still be finding yourself needing to heal everytime your turn lands on your healer which is ridiculous. some of the enemies are just so strong the level suggested is miles away from the level you end up leveling up to to finally beat it.,Negative
"First time I ever played a gacha game without feeling like I needed to rush. It was really fun, sure I've already finished all of the endgame content but I'm still somehow not bored. I'm a day 1 player so I'm surprised by that. Characters have fun personalities. Stories are good. You don't need every character to carry you through most of the game. Beginner friendly, would recommend.",Positive
"One star goes for the story and the other for the character designs The character drop rate has been abysmal and the amount of things you have to farm feels ridiculous. It was my biggest complaint in Genshin and somehow it feels like they made it worse... That is of course my personal experience and so besides that, I would recommend you give it a try and judge it for yourself. You might feel the complete opposite :)",Negative
"Was really enjoyable when it first came out, but over time it's become more stale and boring. Plus, characters are literally being over powered by others every update, and the power creep is insane. It's not a bad game but there are alot of relevant issues.",Negative
"Good story, great that you can make it to end game with a F2P account. Have 2 accounts now, monthly pass is good. More and more gets added, it's awesome. Only spend Jades on special pulls. I still do wish that daily Jades you can get for dailies were a bit higher, like 160 or more so you could do a 10-pull once per week. Other than that it's a great game.",Positive
Its aight. Wish there was a jump button. And more devoplment to enemies. And attack moves. Its reall good eyecandy. But it lacks the playability of a more robust rbg. I think with just a few more evolutions to the gameplay it could be really fun.,Positive
"This game has a phenomenal story, gameplay, lore, characters, graphics, and great community support, i really recommend the game. There are literally hours and hours of entertainment, and there's no space for boredom in this game. Hoyoverse, I hope you keep delivering like right now... Thanks for reading...",Positive
"Don't listen to the bad reviews, they all tried playing the game before the game launched, or didn't read basic descriptions saying that it was turn-based, then got disappointed. It's a well-polished gacha game that doesn't lock exploration and story quests behind stamina, with several dozen hours of fun content on release.",Positive
"This is a very nice game! As a player who's played Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd, this game is very different!! Its a turned based game which is something new for me, which is very cool. Characters have much much lore, personality, and unique things about them which is not a suprise! The way the game is very dark and filled with lore but still has a funny atmosphere and jokes are amazing!! I rate this a very nice game, 10/10!!",Positive
"Absolutely fantastic game, consistent content, incredibly generous, amazing story, couldn't recommend it enough! Mihoyos other teams could learn from the amount of love they put into Star rail and how much they love their community!! Free 10 pulls every patch, qol resin reserve and resin cap increase, and with 1.6, a free 5* you guys are doing absolutely everything right, amazing jobüëèüèªüëèüèª",Positive
I like this game because it's nice. idk if this is a bug or something because whenever I open it it's always giving me the error code 1001_3 something like that it's always like that but I can still open it like I have to open two times just to play but now I think because it's updated it's NOT LETTING ME play the game idk why it's always like this I don't think it's my internet because my internet is good it has no problem. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS!!,Negative
it has amazing graphics and loved it from the start but when i exitted the app and then moments later opened it again i was kinda weirded out that it asked me for my gmail and pass so i did when i logged back in the same acc it reseted its really dissapointing and just heartbreaking since i finally got the character i came to play the game for,Negative
"I can't play the game anymore; my phone can't handle it. I was able to play HSR on my device without a problem when it was first released, and now I can't play it anymore! The more HSR updates there are, the less my phone can handle them! My phone has only 4 GB of RAM; maybe that's the reason it can't launch the game properly. I am sad. I'm so broke to buy a new phone, and it feels like I wasted my time playing this game, and I also feel like all those grinds have gone to waste. I am heartbroken",Negative
"The games graphics was overall cool and the fight cutscenes are so amazing! For people who keep complaining about the gameplay, you guys need to be aware that all hyv's rpg games dont have to be like genshin impact that can move at your free will and so. Feel free to stay there and just dont bother to leave bad reviews here. As if complaining about that can change anything.",Positive
"I justify that Honkai Star Rail is one of the best gacha games out there! Honkai Star Rail opens lots of opportunities to explore, fight, find out lore, and even do a gacha pull. I gave it 5 stars for it's gacha pulling, graphics and I can even use it on my phone, what I mean is it can take a lot of space and storage, but it isn't as large as their most popular game, Genshin Impact.",Positive
"Mihoyo went overboard in a good way with this one. Graphics shouldn't be discussed because it's mihoyo, everything is gorgeous especially hsr is in the ""honkai"" family. Turn based might be boring for some people but not for me, it's been fun and enjoyable but the most important thing is less time consuming because i could just auto the stage. Well all i could say is this is their best game so far",Positive
"If you enjoyed Genshin Impact because it reminded you of LoZ: Breath of the Wild (and also because it's a great game in and of itself), you'll primarily enjoy Star Rail if you're a fan of Persona 4 and 5 and JRPGs of that ilk (Older Final Fantasy games, Chrono Trigger etc.). Not only that, there's so, SO much content provided in here basically for free! If you've played Genshin/Honkai Impact before, you already know the quality of experience is going to be amazing here as well! 10/10 from me!",Positive
Phenomenal polish and immersive story. Character building is top notch! So many genuinely funny moments that have me loving the characters more every time I play (I played in beta as well). This is NOT your standard cash grab or overly generous gacha game. This is a fairly monetized game that delivers quality for every dollar invested.,Positive
"Since day one I haven't experienced any lag or frame drop even with every setting at max with is cool. I'm not comparing this game to genshin just because it from the same developer. I have play this game since it got released right now I don't have any concerns, we'll see after a few weeks or months... and I will update my review",Positive
"This is by far the best turn based rpg game i ever played, has good rewards (10 pulls every patch, rewards for special occasions, a free limited 5 star etc...) and the story is thrilling with some unexpected plots! Hope genshin devs can be the same as hsr's one day...",Positive
this game is so perfect. honkai star rail is in its first patch and it need time to show its full potential. i tgink it is already comparable to genshin easily.to comparing combat. it's perfect turn based game. some people just think that it must be like genshin to count it as perfect game... worlds and story is very fun and characters are great and graphics and movements of characters are better than genshin. this game is in ita first patch and needs time to fix its bugs.its normal.,Positive
"It is a good game, and it has a great story too, but the main problem was when it comes to CUTSCENE, it was started to get framing, and the voice began to crack too, so i couldn't enjoy the cutscene at all, please fix this",Positive
"This game look really nice and very fun to play but unfortunately,I can only play this game on my sister's phone. I really hope that there's a Honkai Star Rail Cloud version like Genshin does so I can play it on my own phone. Nevertheless,I really love this game. The playstyle,the characters's design,the gameplay,and the storylines. Honestly,everything is just masterpiece. I love it.ü§ç",Positive
Drop rates are absolute Garbage. I tried playing this on my phone when it first came out and now on PS5. And not a single 5* roll unless it was guaranteed after doing so many rolls (pity rolls). Also unlike other games that let you restart if you wish that can't be done. It takes 30 days to delete your account. So unless you plan to spend thousands of dollars you'll never have great characters.,Negative
"Nice hud,combat,scenery and really were it's set. Honestly i never liked genshin impact and for me this is kinda like it. Still a nice game for a mobile. I think it was planned to be released before totk so they have the right to say like ""we made it before totk so they copied us"" but honestly a good game. Long to download but alright. Kinda laggy.",Negative
"Usually enjoy playing this, however the 2.0 update released today has broken the game. Struggle to install the update, and then when you get in, it crashes after about 15 seconds of play time. This is on an S22 ultra as well, so not even a phone which is that old. Needs fixing, usually would be a 4 or 5 star game",Negative
"I really love this game, it's like a mixed version of honkai and genshin, it's super fun and it has a much good pity than genshin but I don't hate genshin, and the downs of this game is, it can automatically fight for itself, I don't want autofight cause it will look like im not playing the game. And the lag is the problem but I think it because my phone specs is not good enough for honkai star rail and genshin. I really love your game and I hope this will get a lot a downloads.",Positive
"Game is very fun, but balance and character availability decisions are questionable. Erudition (AoE) characters are greatly underperforming. Later content requires 2 teams, but if you were unsuccessful in pulling a 5* healer, it means you have to run a team without healing, due to there being only ONE 4* healer available. One of the elements (imaginary) has only ONE available character, which is ALSO a 5* exclusive. & the only upcoming imaginary/healers that we know of are also 5* exclusives",Positive
"I'm having fun of this game and I love it very much, but one thing that makes me feel unfair is the gacha system, I pulled for 10000 star rail for seele but I only get one. I have been playing this game since it was out and I really love this game, but I'm having a bad experience of pulling character, I will only get a 5 star character for about 90 pulls.",Negative
"In terms of graphics, gameplay, story line, and mechanics, it is worth a praise. But the framedrops is ruining the game. Please optimize it so that more users will enjoy playing it with atleast a minimal framedrops.",Negative
Gameplay is pretty fun overall. But.... The pull rates are so unbelievably stingy and the amount of pulls you get are stingy. You can't have low pull rates and low pull amounts and expect a game that runs on different characters to feel good when you get none. The pity system resets anytime you pull any character. It just feels like another game where the wallet is the MC,Negative
"As a previous Genshin and Honkai 3rd player, this game takes the gameplay from Genshin and the story aspect of Honkai and makes it the best of each. The writing is quite interesting. I'm hoping to see a lot more! I'm not a big fan of turn based, but I could get behind this. I'm hoping to not get bored of this game.",Positive
"It's so pretty! The graphics, the characters, the game overall, is amazing. However i think that maybe we could like- have more maps? Idk. Anyways, good game ü§© (uninstalled genshin just to try this one out now i dont wanna leave this game üíÄ still like exploring sumeru tho)",Positive
"I love this game. I have played genshin for 3 years, and I think honkai star rail is 100 times better. The graphics are better it's less demanding on mobile than genshin It's optimized way better than genshin. The story is consistently good And is probably the best gotcha Game story i've seen. And the developers actually listen to the community. It's worth your time. You can get addicted easily so Be careful and don't spend too much The game Is a free to play game and you don't need to spend.",Positive
"I am extremely pleased with the launch and first month of honkai star rail, the game runs perfect no real game breaking bugs or glitches, the graphics are just what you expect from mihoyo very clean, animations are top tier and the design and aesthetic is on point for both the world's and characters, this game is also one of the funniest I've played in a long time the writing and sense of humor is refreshing x the only downside is the gatcha mechanics don't pull for everything unless you whale",Positive
"Honestly, love this game. Everything about it is so unique and cool. The only complaint i have is after the new update my game keeps lagging very badly, randomly,whenever i ran, or started the battle . It has never happened before the update and i don't know what to do.",Positive
"Fun game, free to play friendly because of the good reward system, nice plot, good character designs, challenges are good without being boring or overwhelming, nice open world for a game with limited co-op experience. 10 out of 10 game, so far really good.",Positive
I love it! I actually love the story more than genshin. The turn based battles and the cutscenes are so pleasing! I haven't had any issues so far. Hands down one of the best mobile games I've played.,Positive
"I usually dont review a game but this game is really fantastic. The combat, characters, musics, and the world design are marvelous. And the best thing every patch theres some new endgame and the upcoming patch, we can get a one free copy 5* Dr.Ratio. I played a lot of gacha games and this is the 1st time a dev really listen and appreciate us the players. Thank you Hoyoverse and keep up the good work. And congratulations for the awards that u won recently. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!",Positive
"I have read those that gave 1 stars review. There are 2 main types. Those with game loading issue/technical difficulty (which is understandable) and those with skill issue. They whine about game being unplayable unless you spend money on gacha or grinding is a problem. But reality is I play this game without paying a single dime yet and while my luck in Gacha is pretty bad, all of the free stuffs they gave us is more than enough. I didn't even spend that much time each day either.",Positive
"Seems like setting the resolution to ""very low"" causes the game to crash. Already reinstalled a few times to reset the settings so it doesnt crash. For now just avoid ""very low"" on resolution settings.",Negative
"Down to 1 star review.... Game has just become an Idle simulator. Getting more of the same character gives you small percent boosts. I came for space things but the game feels like idle auto battler with honkai characters but story like genshin BUT lack of story of ""trailblazing"" instead you are stuck in these linear ""worlds"" that are as big as 1 city.block....Overall nothing making me want to keep playing as I see every update is going be a lackluster update. BTW I spent 150$ not.small spender",Negative
I wanted to like it since the graphics and storytelling was nice. But the progression and the battles are too slow for me. Not a big fan of turn based games either and this seemed promising but the controls just feel weird words are too small and the battles just aren't fun. Maybe I'll try again some other time.,Negative
"Idk, if this a pattern between Honkai games, but I feel like no matter how much I play the game, my characters don't feel like they become stronger. The game requires you to exert too much effort just to reward little. Just playing and seeing my character do little damage is tiring, my attention span can't take it.",Negative
"It's a Great game and the ist slaps and I would especially love it if it made it to console ngl but There is one problem tho. Whenever I try logging in I keep getting the same error for when I log in,my wifi is ok and same with my data but I keep getting the same thing even when I restart my phone and app. Overall 10/10",Positive
"Everyone who says star rail is bad is clearly a genshin only, and is mad hsr is better than genshin imo. The pacing is amazing, it's not difficult lmao you're just bad at building... it gives a LOT of f2p resources and jades. The only thing I'd change is for the artifacts farming, it'd be better if the rewards were increased, because 40 power for 2 single gold artifacts at tl60+ is a scam:)",Positive
The thing is that I felt very sad just BC and cried so much because I couldnt finish my daily training and it caused me a stomach ache plus head ache. so I would like that the daily training wouldn't be time consuming and since my characters can't do a lot of damage. I couldnt do the echo of war just because my characters right now are level forty and I know that I could do the level up thing but I just wanted to pull you know? I just don't want time consuming daily training rest of the things,Positive
"best game ever, character design are good, free tickets, and it much easier than just locking how much we need more to compete the place such as cloudford, and alot of free stellar jades, the best game ever I seen, this game deverse a 5 stars of course! and we all can't believe we will get Dr. Ratio for free, I am very glad",Positive
"In love with this game! The game devs are so so generous, the graphics are wonderful, I love where the story is going, and the personalities of the characters are so well thought out. I love the music, the events, the mechanics, everything. Can't wait to see where it goes!!!",Positive
"Love the story and characters! Events are fun and rewarding, and the Devs are pretty generous with premium currency. It's one of my favorite games to play on PC and mobile while at work! I'm trying to think of a downside, but I honestly can't...go, play it now, you're welcome!",Positive
"I have never had fun playing turn based games or even gacha based ones at that. But the story, designs, references, and usability of all units (even 4 stars) and unique team comps make this game one of my favorites. The banner system is forgiving (lose your first, then your next is guaranteed), and pulling for signature LCs isn't even necessary. This game has stirred up a lot of drama with Genshin, especially with Dr. Ratio and Lantern Rite, but don't let that soil this games enjoyment for you.",Positive
"It's a beautiful and nice game where the story also feels complete, everything is really decent, the only thing that bothers me is that even after downloading this huge size game it still eats your data so much that it worries me about my data limit as a mobile user, genshin is also big but I can play that all day without being concerned about how much internet it takes, I get 2 gb internet on my phone and this game drains it quite literally, please make the data usage optimized.",Positive
Easily one of the best game i have played. Nice story and turn based combat. Fantastic music and very f2p friendly. They are constantly adding QOL features and very in touch with the community unlike gensin impact. A must play.,Positive
"Very much enjoy this game, great story and systems but shocked to find it doesnt have controller support! This is especially weird considering it does on PC and consoles... And the fact that Genshin has support too, this needs to be fixed!",Positive
"This game is a revolution of Gacha games. As someone who have played a lot of Gacha games, this one (although has similar aspects to Genshin) has impressed me by a lot. The characters look amazing and very satisfying to use. The content doesn't feel forced and it feels like the developers genuinely care and listen to the players! This game have a bright future and hope they keep up the good work! üëç",Positive
"Gacha rates aren't as bad as genshin but roll for who your favorite character is. I am strictly f2p and this game is doable without needing to roll for the limited characters. The grind levels cost a lot of stamina and it is only enough for 10 minutes of gameplay. The story took 1 week to do. Grinding for materials is kinda boring but having auto battle makes it manageable. I played since launch and my trailblazer level is now 70. The story, music, and characters are very good and entertaining.",Positive
"Incredibly done, it shows how much effort and love is put into the game, the dev team is fantastic and listens to the community. It's f2p friendly, you can beat all content in the game and get the characters you want as long as you're dedicated.",Positive
"Good story and characters in a gacha game? Yes, please. Great soundtracks at times (especially boss fights). A bit more generous than Genshin Impact with free 10 pulls given in top of 90 pulls earned. Game mechanics are solid and the puzzles are entertaining. Not bad, just waiting for events and skins, do these justice and this can easily hit 4.5-5 stars. Edit: Gave insane amounts of free stuff - 10 pulls and a free 5 star, genshin cannot compare!",Positive
"Games exciting, the characters and models are high quality, possibly the best game for me rn.",Positive
"Mihoyo keeps learning more about how to deliver unforgettable experiences. The story, characters, music, and overworld all take a step up from Genshin and HI3. The gameplay is very ultimate focused but the inclusion of talents is a fun wrinkle that makes each fight unique. Bravo!!",Positive
It's a great game but freezes and crashes very very very often I can hardly make it through battles especially boss battles But if you don't mind the crashing and having to restart boss battles halfway through its a great game,Negative
A challenging and fun turned based game. Character designs are so good. Interesting story. Filled of easter eggs and exploration is fun even though it isn't open world. I can see myself playing this for years.,Positive
"After already putting in quite a bit of time(Didn't get in beta) my honest opinion is; the game is amazing almost all the way around. It is a refreshing change from their other games, and the storyline continues to amaze me. The only downside I can really talk about is the gacha aspect. Once again; the pull rates are dismal at best.. I have made several accounts and have done over 240 pulls in total... besides the guarenteed 1 in 50 pool; I haven't pulled a single 5‚òÜ.",Positive
"I love this gameü´∂ the lore, the characters ,the animation and rewards everything in this game is just magnificent",Positive
"Cool characters and graphic. If you guys seeing this comment, i hope for more nature places. It would be great",Positive
"Dialogues are awfully generic and characters don't have any charisma or personality, they follow the usual anime tropes and cliches, your mc has amnesia and has a special power that makes them special and is liked by everyone, they are mute too. I wouldn't mind this that much if you could skip it and if there wasn't so much braindead text. Generic artstyle, dialogues, characters and plot. The combat seems pretty good and interesting but the game doesn't want you to play.",Negative
"I want to give my loving praise to the writing team, I love how there's interactables around the world and that they have such silly writing it just adds more charm and fun while exploring. The character interactions are nice and reasonable too. I love how the responses for the MC are more varied in some dialog responses. The writing definitely won me over, it feels more natural and well-thought out and I hope it continues with the same quality. Looking forward the the journey ahead, cheers!",Positive
"It's genuinely the best gacha game there is. I played this since it came out on both mobile and phone, free to play over 2 accounts and so far have had no problem with feeling like I need to pay to play. The game isn't repetitive, the characters are great and there's a lot of humor worked into the game. The developers actually listen to the community. 11/10",Positive
"Love the game 10/10 but like half the particles just have bright pink texture and completely ruin immersion, it affects some enemies, the dash effect and some backgrounds (Edit) only 2 days after my bug report they gave me a fix, fast work, love the game still, Really if I could i would put 6 stars",Positive
Its an incredible game but needs to be optimaized,Positive
"Hello! Just wanna say the game was fun the lore is interesting the battle was fun But I have an issue with logging in to the game, its always say ""login error pls try again later"" For the past 2 weeks. I hope it won't be an error like that again. Oh well the game was awesome!",Negative
"I'm changing my rate from 1 star to 5 star. Although the dialogue has no skip, the game is still great. The graphics, the characters, the UI all of it are great. I'm enjoying the game, but still not reading the dialogue.",Positive
"Login error, please fix it ASAP",Positive
Its an amazing game that has awesome graphics and the audio I get is amazing!Not only that but I like the story as well; there is also the fact that the enemies aren't one shots( except for some parts) the gacha system is pretty cool to.I have no complaints about this game and it's hands down amazing!!!,Positive
"Very fun game that I reminds me of games on Playstation or Nintendo Cube. But, it was done all night last night due to maintenance. And then after the maintenance they took it down again. It's a more involved game than what I have time to play and if I can't even play when I do have time...",Negative
"The game just sucks. It's nice playing the turn-based part of it and the quality is nice but the actual story is extremely boring. Most the male characters are too bland and the females once again have weird clothing designs, why do we need to see the buttcheeks hang out of a character that looks 12 at most? The game also takes forever to load and the character system is messy",Negative
So far I'm really enjoying the game. The story is very interesting and I really like how thought out all the characters are. My only complaint is that the game tends to get laggy kick me out every once in awhile. It gets to be super frustrating especially when you're in the middle of a boss fight.,Positive
"The gameplay is enjoyable but the relic system is so terrible. Farming for the right main stat is already a pain, not to mention the right substats and right substat upgrades which is like one in a thousand relics. A system full of RNG doesn't make the game enjoyable.",Negative
"Graphic is good but story isn't that strong like at beginning we start with a weird lady playing ""air"" violin which looks very out of context. Yes sure there probably is a lore and reasons but as i mentioned that's how it began. Character design feels like combination of the company's other game series. And it's a very stereotype turn base game. Don't really see reasons to play so I stopped within 20min. I feel too generous for even giving 20min to try.",Negative
"Even though there might be some glitches in HSR, it is still a very entertaining game, with multiple characters that are very detailed and have great lore, including their story quests, this game is by far the most entertaining and addictive game I've played, and it's rewards for certain activities are great, I would definitely recommend this game to most people who's willing to do Turn based games like this, it's main quest is extremely fun, overall HSR is an amazing game",Positive
"Good, but I do have a simple issue. Why the f*** wrong with your side quest?! It's too long even longer than the character quests! It took me 45min just to complete a side quest that give absolutely 30 jades! And some exp",Positive
"First week of playing and cant stop. SSS+ Tier animation, story telling, character development, plot, and one of my fav the music during the boss fight, truly a masterpiece. Cant wait to progress more. Kudos to the developers and all who work to bring such a amazing game.",Positive
"Good Optimization, good design, good story, easy to understand, the progress is too slow and rewards are pretty low, unless you like to spend a lot of time here, this it not your game.",Negative
Much more playable on mobile than Genshin. The grind is more paliable since it more controllable and takes at least 10 mins to complete dailies. Genshin requires more delicate controls and playing on mobile is more of a handicap than anything. I get nightmares on the thought of playing the Abyss on mobile.,Positive
"Amazing game! But I have a problem, everytime I log in the game it gets stuck in the loading screen. I have to clear my cache everytime. I have no problems with Genshin Impact though. It would really helped if it can be fixed. Thankyou...",Positive
"There's some bugs in the game like in game sound,log in error and framedrops. Please optimize the game. But the graphics, animations, characters and story is really great.",Positive
I just started and it's amazing!! Good job it's smooth and has a good combat system and story üòÅ,Positive
"Love this game, but I am extremely disappointed with Hoyo's refusal represent poc in their games. Do better.",Negative
This is my first time playing a turn based combat game. So far it's awesome! Good part they give an option to speed up the process in fighting since it takes time for their ultimate and animations,Positive
Star rail story is so sad and awesome I like it. Graphics are much better.,Positive
"Absolutely superb. It's hard to believe we get something this high quality in a mobile game. I don't just mean the graphics either. It's a joy reading through the dialogue, story and miscellaneous reading material in the game (unlike Genshin at times). The gacha is what you would expect in a gacha game, but there are some improvements here compared to Genshin. Can't wait to see how this game grows and develops.",Positive
"The gameplay is very smooth, the graphics are beautiful, and the designs are some of the best. I don't normally like science fiction stuff so I wasn't sure how I'd feel about this game, but it's very addicting. I rate 5 stars. Really the only negative thing about it is that it's addicting, I stayed up til 3 am playing it. People hating on the turn based combat clearly haven't played many jrpgs (which I would assume is what inspired this).",Positive
"Pros: Great graphics, music, animation Cons: Terrible storytelling, little events, slow pacing, lots of running around, repetitive gameplay, steep powercreeping, P2W elements (huge duplicate character and lightcone powerups) It was very impressive initially, but after JUST the first 2 arcs (Herta Space station and Belobog), the pacing, story quality and content all went down significantly, while powercreeping was astonishing. Infinite clone mechanics before first year anniversary, wow!",Negative
"I love this game so much. The characters, the story, turn based combat, etc. The game is actually much livelier than genshin will ever be, as well as the exp per level ratio is MUCH NICER. Im level 44 as of typing this. Why I'm not giving it 5 stars is down to one reason; the character stories. The character stories aren't as in depth as genshin's are. Arlan's story for example just feels like his day to day life, rather than what his background is. If there was more room, I would type more üòÇ",Positive
I love how the creators designed the characters and dialogues so far the story has been very engaging and interesting unlike paimon the characters don't feel annoying the turn based system is a breathe of fresh air also the art and ultimate animations are just super smooth and pretty. 5/5 No complains so far except that the farming of XP materials is a bit challenging at the moment.,Positive
"I rate this game 3/5. I love the game and it's graphics but the problem is when i play it, there's an error the errors name is ""error 1001_3"" and i changed my dns and many more but the error is still there. Please fix this! This is disappointing.",Negative
My story is stuck and no matter how much I restart my phone it is still stuck and I can't exit out of the story,Negative
"Needs some optimization for Poco X6 5G devices, I'm playing on Very Low Settings, 60fps but somehow my FPS is capped at 40fps",Positive
"I don't know if it's my device or your game is just glitchy on mobile but the loading screen is alright, but when I try to click play, it's just a black screen. I couldn't even step into the game.",Negative
"So far, no problem with everything. The only problem is that the game is highly unoptimised. This cause overheat, unstable fps, and crashes. Would be nice if there's a graphic option for opengl for better performance.",Negative
I am a honkai impact veteran at level 90.i downloaded this game just so I could play an entirely different game but with the same characters cause I still love themüòâ.,Positive
"Been really enjoying my time on this game so far. It's very reminiscent of older JRPG's, just with some newer gacha mechanics. All of the characters I've been introduced to so far are quite memorable with vibrant personalities and great voice acting. There's tons of media references in this game which I quite enjoy and a lot of the reading material is actually quite good.",Positive
"No controller support for android is my only problem. It may not be a big deal for some, but I want to use my controllers for these games. Not everyone has a PC and I don't like apple products. Hoyoverse needs to make it fair for everyone and not just to the highest bidder. I love the game, it's great and I like the turn based play style. People upset that the fighting isn't like genshin should go play genshin. Their not going to make the same game 2x. It let's you know ahead it's turn based.#DB",Positive
Big fan of Honkai Impact 3rd & it's the new member in Mihoyo verse so I have to give it a try and I loved it so far. The story is very interesting as our main Astral Express members going to all the different planets in the universe to have an amazing adventure. Also I'm not a fan of turn based games but I don't know what HSR have that I'm hooked to this game. Enjoying my journey so far & excited for the future.,Positive
"Game is great for the most part but relic system is terrible, I've been building characters for months and months to no avail. Doesn't feel good just leaves me disappointed every time I come on to spend trailblaze",Negative
"Great experience overall, really good pick up for people who quit and want to com back, great, setting, badly written parts of the story tho. Controls are easy and is phone friendly.",Positive
"Start game, ok, confirm server, ok, start game, ok confirm serverüòê never did get to the game after 10 minutes of doing this back and forth ü§¶",Negative
"Good graphics and visuals, in game rewards from events are satisfying, f2p friendly as well",Positive
"Its pretty good,i like the story and the way they handle big events,unlike genshin they dont delete them and you can replay them for some rewards. I dislike the way stellar jades/primogems for this game are handled,its very close to how frequently genshin rewards players in terms of quantity but there are more opportunities to squeeze a few extra wishes,but they are better in terms of character giveaway events. Also has decent endgame",Positive
"Very good game. Does take a pretty beefy phone to be able to run at any decent settings. Would recommend pc version over this due to performance and battery drain, but still a very good game :) Edit: I read a LOT of the one star reviews for this game and all I can say is, to those of you complaining about the lack of a skip button, pretty much EVERY SINGLE game out there that is similar to this has got a lot of story and reading in it. So stop complaining and just read.",Positive
When i'm download for 1st time i can log in INTO normal and not to long to log in. The next day the game is keep gimme code and when i'm play is take a LOOOOOOOONGGG time to log in pls fix it.,Negative
"Simply amazing game. Outstanding graphics, very well developed characters, amazing graphics, engaging storyline oh and loving the voice acting as well. English voice acting in anime games is usually awful, but is excellent in this game, keep up the great work development team! This game is epic!",Positive
"(I can only rate it now based on what I had played in the beta before.) Firstly, if you are expecting a genshin-esque experience - it'll be a 50/50! But the game is gorgeous, the models are stunning and unique per character, the story was beautiful and rich! If you have enjoyed Hoyo games before, this is a very clear step forward. Of course, if you are also coming from Honkai, it is more similar in regards!! But also not exact.. but to me, in the best way. The OST was captivating, truly.",Positive
"The combat system is vastly different from Genshin Impact, so don't go rating this game lower stars just because it isn't the same!! In my opinion, it's so much better than Genshin. Better story pacing, amazing pity system for obtaining characters, and an overall interesting combat system!",Positive
"This game is so fun to play,but sadly they doesn't have a coop sistem.I hope that they will be add a coop sistem in the future üôèüèºüôèüèº",Positive
"I really enjoyed this game, great graphics and turn-based gameplay. But why 3 stars? Cuz it took me 4 days for me to not be stuck in the log-in page. I dunno why it keeps saying log-in error, right after I click start. I checked my net, cuz maybe it's the reason why, but its working just fine.",Negative
I loved the first part of the game but when it needed the other update added on it just started getting annoying because I have literally took off most of all my apps videos and pictures that I would like to keep and now I'm not really sure of how much this game is worth when you just take off you're past memories for a game..,Negative
"A turnbased RPG with roguelike gameplay modes, likable characters, and fun gameplay. This game has gacha mechanics with terrible rates, but you get enough currency to guarantee at least two 5Star characters, and most 4Star characters are viable options. MTX are quite pricey for what they offer. You might want to stick to the monthly currency pass and/or the season pass if you plan to spend money. I'd give this game a rating of 9/10. It's a good game with great visuals and outstanding music.",Positive
"I was worried that it would be too much like Genshin Impact (which I already have). Instead, I was treated to lovely new fighting mechanics and a whole universe of new characters to explore. Honestly though, it's been pretty good so far. Also, I think it takes less gacha rounds to get a 100% chance, although I might be wrong on that (haha). If it is true, then it's a bit of a blessing for non-paying players such as myself.",Positive
"game is good, but poorly optimized for mobile devices. better played on pc or console.",Negative
"After this new update, every time i open honkai star rail keeps restarting my phone... I already re-install and clear cache still same, at some try i stuck in main screen but when i touched to start it will restart my phone, pleaseee....fix thisss ASAP !!! I often play this game in this same phone and nothing happend , just after this new update this problem arises I used pocophone F1 android, memory space 65GB left, 6GB RAM.",Negative
"Mid. All around, just mid. That's it. Nothing new or interesting about it. In fact, I'd say that it being a turn-based RPG takes it a step down from what Genshin was. At least with that game, the combat was a little more than simply ""watching characters on the screen fight while you sit idly by and watch, except for pressing a few buttons every now and again."" Just another disappointing gacha game in a long line of disappointing gacha games. Pom pom's presence is the only saving grace it has.",Negative
"Basically a ff wannabe. Characters look all the same as other games of theirs. Dragging story scenes, slow animations that is agonising to watch that it feel like it should be played with 2x speed. Nothing new with same old assets but became a turn based which is boring to play. Should just stick to genshin or honkai if I were you.",Negative
I like turn based games and this one is Top tier when it comes to story telling!,Positive
"I can't get in first because it always says error. I need to log in 3 times to enter the game. Please fix that. But overall, the game is great and smooth. I also like the story and the characters are great",Positive
You get to a point where a certain character is needed to progress. If you don't have that character you're screwed. Must think me stupid I guess.,Negative
"Honestly, 3.5. 4 on gameplay but 3 on the gotcha aspects. High quality and as close to a classic rpg as I've seen in mobile. My main complaint is that they are incredibly stingy in resources and pull rates are terrible. This is one of the few games I understand players rerolling on. Whoever you get in your first few hours, is going to be your main for a long time.",Negative
Very good game the only thing that's wrong is that it's pretty big on PC and I lost my old account.,Positive
Overall this game is great. The story and character design and development are top notch. But the combat really turn me down. It's strategy turn based rpg but really easy and makes people boring.,Positive
"It would be 5 stars, but, I'm trying to log into my main account again but it keeps putting me in the wrong server for some reason. It's getting quite annoying, I've already tried uninstalling and reinstalling and that isn't working at all.",Positive
"I finally uninstalled. It starts off good. Clearly polished. The problem is the rewards aren't worth the grind. I made it trailblazer 50 and once I saw the resources I needed, the time it took just to get a few, and the amount of characters I had(I had six 5*), I knew I'd be bored before I could enjoy this again. Nothing feels worse than getting a new character knowing you have to grind for weeks for it to catch up to your highest. Battles are way too long for characters with 2 abilities.",Negative
"I love how generous the devs are in every update,I also love how they take good care of their game and their players..overall I love the gacha system,the story,and the gameplay. Amazing app for everyone who likes turn-based RPG games!!",Positive
"Absolutely beautiful. I mostly play it on pc but the fact that it runs super well on my phone I can enjoy it while I'm not at home. The animation is gorgeous, the story is good and I love all the characters so far. Super excited for the future of this game <3",Positive
If any of you genuinely struggle with the games difficulty literally get good that's all I can say just use a brain or something idk,Positive
"I don't get people who expect this to be ""Genshin"". It's NOT Genshin. This game is in a totally different genre, a turn-based RPG. I really enjoy how it has the nostalgic JRPG vibe but with great graphics. The quests are pretty fun. Definitely my kind of game.",Positive
"This is the initial Reaction. Review pending. Above all Else. I'm loving the exploration. From looking for chests to lil robots, The rewards are even premium currency so it makes it worthwhile and fun. I accidentally Warped on the banner trying to click on The Tickets to find out what the tickets were for so that's like 900 Stellar Jades Down the drain ( The premium gems used to Pull on the banner I just learned) The combat is like Final Fantasy 10 is it's nice. Will check on how P2W it is",Positive
I really like this game the fight animations are really nice and it's really fun and I love March 7,Positive
"Fundamentally, it is a good simple game, with fun and unique characters with enjoyable stories to follow. The game is, unfortunately, plagued by the genshin curse: God awful summons rates that are designed to gouge you. Not only that, the game has the genshin no content loop: log on, spend stamina in 3 minutes, and have nothing left to do. Dry and hardly any content. With all the negatives, it's still a fun and simple game to pick up, play, and put down whenever. Which is the mihoyo policy...",Negative
"The plot is good, the game isn't so bad.. The charcters are pretty and hot. The gatcha is...",Positive
"Lot of people are comparing the game to Honkai Impact/Genshin Impact, don't be that person. It does have a few Easter eggs from those games but this game is a bit different. It is turn based but as an old school final fantasy fan this brought me lots of joy. I also appreciate the system for pulls where if you don't get one you like within 300 pulls you can pick a character. It's fun but as usual I'm stuck at a wall where I need to be a certain level to progress. Love the game though",Positive
65+ hours into the game as a F2P player and the game is alot of fun. Alot of talking going on but story is decent and engaging but at times..just can feel like it runs on and on.With out spending a dime I have acquired (4) 5* units just not Seele or how ever u spell her name.Now after 65 hours I have lost my desire to play there is no ps5 controller support but PC players are able to play without any limitations...maybe down the line(when it's comes to ps5 console) we'll get controller support..,Negative
"Love the game, except for the fact that the audio is completely broken on my phone. The voice acting is wonderful and it is upsetting that I cannot hear it. The sound only works when clicking buttons in the notices menu. I have not muted anything, my volume is up, and the problem still persists after complete reinstall. I'm unsure how common this issue is as there is no fix online. There is still no sound even with headphones.",Negative
"Better than Genshin ngl. Not being biased but the Dev team treatment here is just way too good and actually rewarding. Games engaging but of course there are times that it was tiring but at the very least better optimization and rewarding. Instead of giving a forced petitioned 13 Wish, game's actually helping players to earn Jades in the current event and gave free 5* last update. 11/10 Genshin. Could. Never.",Positive
"Need more event, reward and need more unique enemies. It will be awesome if Combining certain hero skill generates new skill in battles like chrono cross. Not just weakness element. I have played many many turn based games and still got the same mechanics.",Negative
"Very good game, the only issue I have is that it's almost 30gb and 2.2 isn't even out yet",Positive
"I love it like the histori,characters and the new zone to explore and most important the music man i so godd nice work HSR",Positive
Please improve optimization for mobiles. I've recently started receiving a lot of lag.,Negative
"One of the best turn based game i ever played. Simple yet very challenging. They are so generous on their rewards, they listen to their players feedback. I will keep supporting this game and looking forward for more end game content. You did great guys keep it up.",Positive
"Overall the game is quite addictive, i just have only one problem so far. The game just crash whenever i want to log in the game. I'm using POCO X3 PRO, and please fix the problem ASAP so i can enjoy the game without any problem. Thank you ....and have a great day...",Positive
It has better storyline. The characters are very awesome.The boss fights are insane,Positive
"Absolutely love the game on PC but on mobile, it's unplayable. Even with the lowest graphics, the game will almost always crash upon entering a battle.",Negative
Totally generous in giving Stellar Jades and totally worth the pull on characters. End-game contents are so cool and a lotü•≥,Positive
Managed to log in once but got a bug during silver wolf's ult in the tutorial. Was forced to exit the game and come back but it keeps saying login failed error 1001_3 üíÄ let me in and play pls üíÄ Edit: Managed to fix it myself. Im all good üí™,Positive
Cant really enjoy the game as my account is being jinxed whereby it always lose 50/50. Maybe developer enjoy seeing the player suffers. The upgrading resources also limited to very low amount which hardly get purple grade material per run. There is no joy in reaching higher level because the amount of upgrading material is just marginally better than what i could get before reaching a higher level of equilibrium. I'm really not sure the developer aware about this problem,Negative
Started playing in a few days after the launch until now and i can say that im satisfied with the game. Tho everytime i tried to log in the game it shows log in error and i had to refresh and try it again. Hope you can fix it.,Positive
Soo ummm there is a bug that let you see through walls well not really but when I start the game the train is not there and when I log in the only thing I can see is the galaxy and I can be able to see the chest and the items are floating so please please fix it I really love this game so much (ps same goes with Javillo six can't see walls floor and I can see floating items and chest around the map it's like an x-ray is turn on),Negative
"It's basically geshin (treasure boxes, destructible objects, secret hidden treasures, gatcha and reward system) and honkai 3rd impact but with turn based combat. It's not open world (kinda like the H 3rd levels) but you don't experience any repeat levels and they're pretty decent sized. The gatcha doesn't appear to be as punishing as other hoyo games. Only downside is can't skip dialog or cutscenes",Positive
"Everything is perfect as always, folks. But i hope you guys can update the audio quality at some point. Because it's highly different from the PC version where the audio is clean but on mobile, it's kind of noisy and pinching my ear drum somehow. I mean what is say and i say what i mean. Go check it if you don't believe me",Negative
"This is a good game, but I have issues about the in-game graphics. There would be missions that require observing or finding the objects, and unfortunately for me, most of the objects won't load, including the ground. I hope this will be fixed soon.",Positive
Brilliant game!! Surpassed my expectations in gameplay. The turn-based fighting is incredible and the open world aspect is seamlessly woven into the gameplay style! If I could rate higher then 5* I would. Another masterpiece!,Positive
"Well i love to play it on my phone, but there is some issues that i faced when playing the game, like neverending loading screen, sudden black screen, sometimes when trying to fast travel to pom pom it glitched and the char is outside of the train.....",Negative
"Great game in terms of visuals, voice acting and story so far. Fresh feel and doesn't feel like a chore to grind. The character mechanics are fun and strategic for boss battles but you can auto for the easy mobs. I think this game is a scientific study. They are testing how fast they can make someone blind by damaging the optic nerves with all the flashing or stimulate epilepsy. Please save our vision and enable us to turn off the flashing when using ults.",Negative
This game has great graphics. Great voice acting skills. But I wanted to find a game that is more open world. This is space and inside a ship and hit and slash. Not my cup of tea. Also it overheats my phone and runs the battery down super fast.,Negative
"HERE ME OUT EVERYONE i dunno why people seems so disappointed with this game. Most of them don't know yet or smt this game is tur based and imagine it open world game like genshin. I mean this is turn based game and it's really awesome, for me the bettle is interesting and also the story is amazing. Character build and others also cool. I really love this game, i love starrail!üñ§üñ§üñ§",Positive
"The Game was great! Instantly became one of my favorites, the graphics and the characters are so cool! But though I wish in future updates players will be given the option to jump .",Positive
I find the turnbase fighting weird and I don't like it very much. I do like that there is sort of a stealth mechanic and I can sneak by enemies with out being spotted or to avoid a fight.,Negative
This game has very interesting storyline. It captures you and makes you want to keep playing. The battling and missions are simple to complete. As well as fun memories and fantastic animation.,Positive
I don't do negative reviews but I'm pretty disappointed so far. I haven't played Honkai games but I did play genshin and love tower of fantasy. I played 4 hours and its mainly story scenes. The exploration areas are small. I'm spoiled by bigger maps. My character looks homeless and can't customize them and the game teases constantly about customization yet doesn't deliver. I wish to climb things. Can't. Fighting is turn base. I wanted to like it. Feels like downgrading so far.,Negative
"For a turn-based strategy game, there is a lack of strategy here, with only 2 skill options available. The open world element feels dull, with a short fixed path, 3-4 enemies and useless items in 'treasure chests'. The gacha rate is awful, and the mission rewards don't feel very rewarding. Lastly, unskippable dialogues that require you to wait until the very end of the scene to tap to the next line even though the text has already stopped. I have several more points but 500 characters limit are",Negative
Really cool for a TBG. The break mechanic is so satisfying to pull off(and the sound of it *chef's kiss*). The Visuals are good and the movements are so smooth. The dialogues are funny and the main Trio are the cutest. 11/10 so far.,Positive
"It's a OK RPG, it lacks the ability to easily play around with effective team comps and abilities due to the gatcha and heavy investment of in game resources to make any character usable. I'd recommend any other ""classic"" non micro transaction RPG over this.",Negative
"I HATE how you have to control the character: like a game that uses a controller with knobs, but instead you use a Tiny round spot on the screen & it is So FRUSTRATING to try NAVIGATINNG the character. I could not play this game for more than 10 min. without getting mad at it. Cellphone games should always just be tap the screen where you want the character to go. I got no where at all in the game because the character & surroundings were too DIFFICULT to navigate",Negative
"Dialogues are funny, game mode (simulation universe) are fun and repeatable. game is more suitable on phone comparing to genshin. As usual, the downside is character and equipment are locked behind gacha wall, which some people might not like it.",Positive
"Have been playing since day 1 of release and the game in just a short period has become better and better with every patch update, the story and content is alluring and a great game for both casual and hardcore gamers as the game has more end game content and permanent events players can enjoy everytime, at there own pace. ‚ò∫‚ò∫",Positive
"I just beat the first world of this game and I'm blown away, the story is an absolute masterpiece, it's had me feeling every emotion known to man, every little thing I see, hear, and experience has my jaw dropped or given me goosebumps! I absolutely can't wait to keep playing this!",Positive
3 star because me and many people have been experiencing a bug when me and other people log in the game it always say login error occurred please try again later it have happened to me 50 times now please hoyoverse fix this bug me and many people really want to play the game so bad üò≠ if you fix the problem THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOVE YOU HOYOVERSE please respond üôÅ,Negative
"A lot of people hate on the game for being a ""genshin clone"" but the only similarity I see between the two is the art style. 5 star characters don't feel anywhere near as rare either. And the turn based combat gives it more of a Persona 5 feel",Positive
"Very great turn based game with awesome characters and designs, no issues so far. Its a grind to level up characters but it is what it is i found it quite enjoyable, definitely worth a try.",Positive
"The theme is very refreshing (Space travellers). Gameplay is engaging. Lots of different ways to play, no p2w wall. Having lots of fun and cant wait to see what else they bring to the game!",Positive
"Game devs, please help!! I love this game! It's perfect for me, but I only installed for the good Mistplay benefits. Unfortunately, I had an interruption during download and I'm getting no points for playing. I want to continue playing but I don't find it worth it right now without my points. Don't get me wrong, the game is worth playing in general, I'm just prioritizing Mistplay due to my financial situation. Please, is there anything that can be done? I'm devastated.",Negative
"This might be the best game ever, they take the joke too seriously and guess what they're give awaying every 5 star character possible! The best! I love the graphics and the story is so good and the quests are really easy to do.",Negative
"this is the best game I've played especially for turn based. I'm lovin the characters, the lore, aesthetics and the graphics of gameplay üòçüòçüòç i hope we have more events in the future and keep those characters on rerun please!",Positive
"This game is unexpectedly good!! I did not expect myself AT ALL to get addicted to this game, the story quest is amazing and bronya's character development is chef's kiss. This is like genshin era for me all over again where I find myself grinding and just exploring the areas nonstop.",Positive
"If I could rate 0 I would, it seems all cute, and it would be cute yk if I could get into the game. I entered everything into the horrible glitchy horizontal screen and won't flip to vertical, and every time something went wrong. Either the register button didn't work or my passworda ""weren't the same"" when I literally copied and pasted them into each box, or sometimes I just couldn't type. Fix your game, I couldn't even play it.",Negative
"Wish it could have better offers. Amazing story, but those normal packages too expensive!",Positive
"I LOVEE the genshin and honkai feel of the game. It's not just another honkai, it's a mix of the two and that's what I love about it. Everything about the new game I just love. The new game play in battle, the character designs up to the scenery of the game is just amazing and beautiful. I love it so much. Dont know why anyone could hate this gameü´∂‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
After updating to the new update the game keeps crashing whenever i try to play. Before the update i can still play it without crashing but now when i try to open something in game it crashes. Hope you can fix it,Negative
"This game is NOT for people with little patience. A LOT of places in the map have those ""invisible barriers' that block you from going wherever you want to go, so, you'd have to find another path. And since this game is turn based, you can't move freely so it feels even more slow. Many parts of this game have limitations which I don't really like , especially the blocking of paths that shouldn't even have a reason to be blocked.",Negative
"I love the game , it's story, it's exploration but it's starting to get too big , I would really appreciate if you could add an option to delete past quest resources just like in genshin .",Positive
"I tried this game on PC, and its great but when i downloaded the game on my phone, the game keeps crashing when it downloads the files, so i cant play it. My phone runs PGR well, so i dont see the problem why the game keeps crashing. I have 20+GB of memory in my phone so thats not the problem. The mobile experience is pretty sour currently",Negative
"very good game, i like the story and characters, the gameplay is also fun, the teams you can do are nice to play... but i gotta say, bad servers and connection, this game is literally the only game ever i CANNOT PLAY with 4g with MAX signal... literally all the other 4 games i play work on my 4g, which at least 2 need 100% constant connection, and they work, HSR doesnt, there's also the fact the ping in this game is abysmal, i get 20 to 30% more ping than any other game i played from same region",Positive
"You'd better make sure your device can handle this game, if you want to crank the setting all the way up: 15Gb!!! I'm sure the game is gorgeous, and a blast to play, but my phone can't touch it. I'll give it 3 stars, because the product description doesn't warn you of this. Have fun, everybody, I'm sure this is a really incredible game!",Negative
"The game is fun but I have an issue on android. Some textures don't load properly and just show a pink square for example when I go to characters it shows a big pink rectangle spanning my screen, but when I open it on my laptop it all works fine. I use a galaxy s22 and have never had issues like that with any other game",Negative
It's good but when I start trying to play it keep saying about wi fi and There is no wi fi but when I look There is wi fi,Positive
I really enjoy the game and each of the challenges especially the simulated universe,Positive
"If it's not turn based game I would have loved it,but turn based game is kinda restrictive,ü•∏again its has amazing system friendly to players,but turn based playing style is not a thing for me and the 3 stars is for other amazing futures in the game.",Negative
I really love the game but the cut scenes never run properly it's always hang and sometimes it even closed the game even though the game was said to be run smoothly in 6GB Ram mobile phone . Please do something about it or tell me if i am doing something wrong,Negative
"Gameplay is great, awesome art, bosses and events get harder as the game progresses making players find and create better strategies with powerful characters. I do wish the map to be more interactive like letting players do some fun parcure",Positive
It is really realistic but it took all my other games just to get Honikai Star Rail to work... I am not very happy about it üòí üòí I HATE IT,Negative
"Nothing much of a game, just like any other of turn based games. It helps with their godly improved character design. The story itself it's a meh, I mean sure, they somehow good, but bruh the story is full of jokes.",Negative
"I really like Honkai, this game has given me more happiness with all the awards than Genshin could ever do. One of the things I don't like it's that we can jump and the areas that we can do to, I just wanna explore and some areas in some places don't let me and I don't really like that. But besides that I love Honkai Star Rail",Positive
"The story is really engaging, and character designs are top-notch.",Positive
"The one thing I really hate about this game is the relic system. Otherwise it's great, the characters are interesting, fun to play and have cool designs, the story is nice and the music is awesome.",Positive
I am uninstalling this game. The game is good but the new Sunday boss is too difficult. Please ease the difficulty.,Negative
"for people having white screen etc , laggy or delay .. go to graphic setting , set resolution to normal , character to high , anything other than those 2 , you can turn it off or set it to lowest .. its still looks better",Positive
"Been playing on PC since launch, and I love the game already, but.. Game is literally unplayable on my phone when I switched there. Its so laggy, and I get an error 1001_3 every time I try getting in the game. Gamplay experience wise, really really great! Mobile experience, utterly abysmal. 5/5 on PC, 0/5 on Mobile, cuz its not even playable.",Negative
"I could say this is a really turn-based game. But the only thing that I don't like is Seele's ultimate. I want her ult animation to be more creative because as a five star unit, she deserves a pretty ult animation. Speaking of rewards, this game is generous and rewards are amazing. That's it. I like this game.",Positive
I love this! But the issue is when I battle and use march 7th to defense or go too characters And pull It kicks me out of the game I don't know why it does that then I started to get laggy experiences it's getting annoying I Also have good internet I'd have to uninstall the game and start over again But the game Awsome,Negative
"I'm gonna be honest with yall, this game is my FAVOURITE game because of the gameplay and the story, this game's story IS VERY GOOD like literally everything makes sense and the dialouges are sometimes funny so you dont get bored because of formal writings everyone is doing, also the combat DAMN I LIKE IT eveything is good the graphics is good and the mechanics is INSANELY GOOD but you need to learn how to use the specific character and thats literally the best part of this game.",Positive
"Probably THE best game I've played on my phone of all time, actually the best game I've played of all time PERIOD. I've played genshin before, but its beaten out by this game by alot, I've also played honkai impact and it's massively beaten out, I even forget that sometimes I'm technically playing a honkai game. Tldr, amazing game if your phone can run it, worth a shot if it could and you won't regret it",Positive
It is a fun game with a great plot the game offers a lot of gameplay that is action packed,Positive
"Beautiful graphics, interresting universe building, excellent waifus and husbandos, godlike music, characters so filled with flags that we might see a dark story ahead. Dont let the stigma of turn based game deter you from trying. Arent the greatest games to ever exist also turn based? Like chess, pokemon, persona, etc..",Positive
broo the quality is so good but i just hope that it's more like genshin l.. like you can touch the water and jump also and for the task the trailblazer task is the mose amazing but it's few i recommend to add more trailblazer task and other task too and i was saying earlier i recommend too to make the trailblazer can walk to water can jump no object like there's no blocking there way,Negative
"The game is very fun but after the 1.1 update, i couldnt play the game anymore and the game wouldnt load in properly, ive seen other people experiencing the same thing with the train during the loading screen not loading in fully so please fix these bugs and issues, thanks",Negative
Amazing game I love it so far it's been amazing and also a lot of challenges when you reach TL 65 it's truly where f2p players will have a hard time since it's very hard at that point because your enemies are all above LV 82 while your highest level that can be reached is LV 80 so you have to use all that stock up knowledge that you have accumulated while playing it. This game has been so fun for me thank u ‚ù§Ô∏è developers for making such an amazing game I hope it will stay playable as an f2p me.,Positive
"Really like the game but the ungenerous gacha, time gating, and absurd amount of filler quests is kinda ridiculous. The amount of extremely boring unskippable dialogue got me to stop playing tbh. No game with this amount of dialogue should force you to listen into every single one of them.",Negative
I wanted a Sci-fi Genshin. So I'm definitely the target demographic. This game is very fun and easy for anyone to play. I like that these controls can bring more players in that are not good at playing an action rpg (genshin). Enjoy.,Positive
"i gave the first 5 stars but after the jing yuan update, i got some glitches like my screen goes white when using natasha's ult and becomes very laggy when jing yuan's ult. I do not know why. maybe my phone doesn't support it but all my settings like graphics and others are low. I hope honkai star rail can fix this problem because I really like this game",Positive
"There's 3 main thing that lead me to uninstall this game after 2+ patch: 1. The equilibrium level ( world level in GI) , if u accidentally increase the level to 8. YES this are not adjustable unlike genshin. This could potentially brick your account, even small mob are lvl 80+ 2. The grind in this game are too much if u want to play content in equilibrium lvl 8. Equilibrium lvl 8 means lv 80 squad + gear and traces 3. Low quality event compared to genshin or even hi3rd",Negative
I take it back. Please fix the hanu/hamster knight mini game. It's unplayable on low end devices.,Negative
"Easier gameplay than genshin , love it. Top character design, generous devs , great character balance, the fact that 4 stars are good and the 3 star weapon are also viable, great story and and good environment is great and all. But the Free Dr.Ratio is the cherry on top for me to continue playing this game cause i as a player feel appreciated. Great job honkai star rail hoyoverse devs. Keep up the good work and i wish you guys success.",Positive
"Played over a hundred hours, the free pulls that u get is not even enough to get a single five star that's why they're generous about it and just a bunch of thrashy heroes all u get",Negative
"I enjoyed this turn-based rpg so much. The game is pretty much fast-paced, interesting semi open world, great music as always, characters interaction are all cool. Game contents much better, and grinding time :) Glitch is the only issue on my device. I'm turn-based enjoyer played this since day 1 server open so this is a *5 for me",Positive
"The story is generic. Some of the characters are good, while others are plain stupid. The gatcha, as in many games like this, breaks the game and makes it not fun. I plain the game to have fun, not stress myself with pay to play mechanics and outright greediness.",Negative
"Ok. The story is very intriguing, and leaves you waiting for updates. The character designs are fairly nice, and appear to take inspiration from Honkai Impact 3rd (Hoyoverse IP). Combat wise the game excels, simple to understand, yet intricate. No apparent bugs, and runs smoothly with the proper settings. Better than Genshin (Another Hoyoverse IP), but, similarly, it has it's flaws. Gets insanely grindy late game, almost to a crawl. They do counter this with plenty of freebies. Not bad.",Positive
Pretty awesome game. Story is great as well as the old school turn based combat,Positive
"I've been on the loading screen for over 1h and half a minute, and it still says ""seems there's an error 100_1"". I've been trying to get in but it seems it is still there even when I tried closing the game and coming back again",Negative
This is a beautiful app with good colors and graphics my only complaint is that some of the fighting scenes are almost impossible especially the Equilibrium fight I've died so many times and have only been able to beat one bot (both bots are level 29 and ALL of my characters are level 30) and I've tried everything I can't even progress in the game until BOTH bots are defeated,Negative
"the story isn't that interesting even though they put out so much reference still.. its not that good sad they didnt add skip button so i have to leave my phone in auto mode, but the animation when using ultimate and boss doing ultimate during a battle are cool enough",Positive
Enjoyed the game but seems like i need a separate phone for this. Eats up too much phone space. The last update wanted to download more than 6gb of additional resources. Had no choice but to just delete the game and it gave me more than 10gb of free space.,Positive
"Probably the best turn based game out there imo It got pretty much everything you need for a game like this Fairly new and already have alot of contents Unique gameplay pair with great effects Through this game is quite laggy I wouldn't expect it to be more laggy than the company's previous game ""genshin impact"" Still need more optimizing for lower end devices Looking forward to it!",Positive
"Very good game. Excellent even, haven't found a game where it keeps me going for days until now. Definitely recommended. Great art style, graphics, mechanics and overall everything! Keep up the great work!",Positive
"Best game ever, all the farming complaint I had about genshin are solved, nothing feels like a chore, the characters interact all the time(not just in story quests) so it feels like a true adventure with friends! 10/10 I have nothing but praise for this game. Keep up the amazing work hoyo ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç",Positive
"I like it at the same time I don't like it I pre-registered this game a few months ago I was really excited overjoyed but when it was released oh god was it laggy every time I log in it kicks me out saying error or whatnot I didn't mind it that much cause it let me in a second time so far it was good but I got a problem lags, weird movement the head keeps glitching for all characters fyi I was still doing the tutorials so üëç I was really excited yk but it made me disappointed at the end.",Negative
"Do you like genshin impact, do you like using your head or just over lvl fights to win, or do you like a game with more refrences and memes in one line of dialogue then most games can contain, do you want free to play units that are actually amazing then this is the game for you its so quirky and fun to play all the vatious game modes are fun and the world is intresting to explore.",Positive
"Another great game by Hoyoverse, the makers of Genshin Impact. This time it's a turn based space age adventure rpg, charactere and story is very well fleshed. The gameplay is easy yet entertaining and has its dept, the game has an auto battle mode so it's very time efficient as well, the daily tasks are quite easy to do so on overall it takes much less time than Genshin. However it is a bit more grindier than Genshin, butthese games are more of a marathon so play it at your own pace .",Positive
"Hi, this game is really interesting and fun to play the mechanic in this game is similar to fgo game got counter role for me it's easy to understand and I'm really like the game but there's a problem in this game when I start playing the background turning in to white and it ruins my mood to play the game but it makes me thinking is it a bug or what?I only can give 3 stars but will rise the stars if the problem fixed",Negative
"One of my fave games now. Love the story, the side quests, the characters, the events, and the fact that the devs are very generous with tickets and jades and other stuff - I played a lot of gacha games and most of them are not like that. Hope the devs will keep this up and thank you for this game.",Positive
I like this game it was more fun than genshin impact bc it's so funny in another way and the choices that we can talk about in personal opinion and emotions in game üéÆ . I also like the characters that have their own stories and personality that very good and details. And my personal like is that I can this game until I sleep that a good thing bc I can't sleep,Positive
"It's interesting at first, but I recommend playing a offline turn based game. ( GG, but they tried, sigh = / needs a lot of storage. If you like the music good for you but the grind is no fun after a few characters.)",Negative
Doesn't get more free to play than this in a Gacha game. You can complete every event and quest without spending money. Most (feels like all) mobile games require money to complete events. You can catch up to endgame content in 2 weeks unlike other games where it would take 2 years.,Positive
"Needs more optimization. I'm using Tecno Pova Neo 2, and it isn't as smooth as it should be with the lowest graphics possible. Optimize more so it can be smooth. Story and graphics are wonderful. Just needs more optimization.",Negative
"Help i suddenly can't login and I've been trying all sorts of ways for it to let me in, login error 1001_1 keeps popping up. I love this game a lot and I don't want this thing to keep happening",Positive
"At the beginning, I thought it was just a regular turn-based game with genshin/HI3 theme. But turned out mihoyo offers new experience of turn-based game with fresh mechanics and packed it with amazing story line. Great job!",Positive
This game is absolutely pretty prettttttty good !!! Enjoyable and fun with all those anime characters,Positive
"People who seriously try to play ""MMORPGS"" (especially full blown 3D/PC quality graphics) seriously need to get f'en lives. Play that shhhh in your rents home (cause u know u still live with them) on a PC. Like, ""mobile"" gaming and MMORPGS shouldn't even be in the same sentence. Plain and simple. People MAKING games like this with this stupid assumption it's ""good"" need to f'en stop. If you have the TIME to be playing an MMORPG on ur phone, end yourself. U are already a failure. Facts.",Negative
"I loooove the game so much, however i recently had to change my phone and now i can't download it because I don't have space and it can't be downloaded in an sd card",Positive
"Cool game. Lots of free pulls, nice difficulty curve, reasonable farming, runs well, and the story is pretty good. The dialogue can be hilarious at times, too. And the combat is satisfying",Positive
Just let us playing on Intel HD already!!! I can't even get to play the new story!,Negative
"I'm not big fan of trun-based games but this is an exception. Amazing game, with amazing and unique character designs, the story is really well written, the soundtracks too. The wishing system is also much better than genshin's and overall it's a fantastic game totally recommend if you like trun-based RPG games and anime.",Positive
"Same issue with Genshin. Incredibly unfriendly to F2P with the energy system, you can get maximum 4 full runs of equipment grinds in this game at max stamina, and stamina refills get progressively more expensive the more times you do them. The only way to level gears is through trashing other gears, so Ive ended up with an insanely underleveled team despite making it through the entire story and all but 2 of the side quests. Story is good, art is pretty. Fix the levelling system please.",Negative
Worst turn based game i have ever played.. Others might like it because it's similar to genshin. But for me turn based and Genshin Impact does not go together. I have palyed lot of worse turn based games. This one is the worst of all. Enemy is too tanky for a new player. Plus has a shield... As a new player you can't have dps of all the elements that's impossible. And without proper weakness it's impossible to kill. Plus no immunity available from the bad effects.. In Genshin you can move.,Negative
Its a beautiful game with funny characters. The battles are amazing.,Positive
"Love this game! Pretty f2p friendly and the characters are well designed. Also has an autobattle feature. The relics all need to match to get the bonus though, unlike how Genshin can have one offset pc",Positive
That perfect game can your team make something 1 female character miror copy like ultimate or just enemy weapon as her regular weapon like and explore more about kafka past story,Positive
"the story and graphics is great. it basically a H.I.3 in turn based game. the gacha is good compared to others i guess . it is also f2p friendly, the free characters can make it up to the latest content without any pull. also a lot of contents that give you a lot of stellar jade so you can use it to pull characters later. this game is so much casual not like genshin. easy to grind except the relics and its specific stats you want.",Positive
156 pulls but still not getting the character i want on their banner is crazy (character in question is aventurine) the character warp wish rates are poor and could be re-looked at,Positive
great game and story! lots of contents to do,Positive
"Spent half an hour downloading 2.7 GB update data & creating an account, only to find it essentially unplayable, crashing half of the time when starting it, and the other half the gameplay is choppy.",Negative
It is cool. Feature. Anime. 3d. But where is the earth? Isn't it supposed to be spawned there?. Like you can't create you're OWN human üíÄ even the character that can have a heal ability can heal him self. But the REALLY good thing about this game is that you can LITERALLY turn off you're phone if even you're still having a cutseen perfect 5 stars because the loading. 2x. Rate it you're self it üò∂,Positive
Very well written main story with great side quest! It is surprises after surprises with great cliffhanger,Positive
"Big Time Data Waster. I can't see why this game uses so much data, I can play a MOBA and use 1/10th of what this game ran through. WoW uses less data than this game even in 25 man raids. If you have a limited amount of data per month: Do Not Install or Play this game. It WILL eat through a lot of your data in an hour. A Lot! So much so that I am uninstalling the game because of it.",Negative
I've been waiting for months to play this game in android and it finally releases i was so excited to play but the problem is I can't log in even how many times ii tried updating it but it's still the same even now please fix the error so that i can play it I'll give a 5 star if the issue is fixed thankyouu!,Negative
"Fantastic game. I love how the trilling events never ends, they just keep on coming. Controls are great, so as the graphics, music, etc. I just super love this game.",Positive
"Hsr costumer service can't even solve their own in game restrictions to player ""too many request, try again later"".",Negative
"I love writing in this one, for me it's much better than in Genshin. Very nice implementation of JRPG mechanics. Music is blowing me away. Plus turn based combat makes it much comfortable to play on mobile. Very satisfied",Positive
"Best gacha game that I've play so far, but my luck isn't great",Positive
Good game love the combat but the game tends to crash way more often than i expected i could just put my phone in my pocket mid combat cause im in the middle of something important and its a instant crash until the crashing stops this isn't a 5 star game honestly ruins the experience,Negative
"Started playing recently, all went well until game started eating up all of my device's memory... after last update had to unisntall as it was already using 26gb and still needed more to download the patch... too bad as i was enyoing it, but i just couldnt sacrifice anything else on my device in order to free up space...",Negative
"Love the game and combat. Also I'm giving it 5 stars to try to counter all the people who are complaining about this game since it isn't genshin, like come on it was marketed as turn based at every turn but you just want to play genshin. If you did or are thinking about giving a bad review just because you prefer genshin combat don't. Some valid criticism is the lag and bugs but not the combat.",Positive
"+ Pretty good story + Excellent visuals, characters, world, acting +/- Fun but hollow turn based combat (essentially color matching for breaks) - Usual Gacha grind/greed/burnout you'd expect -No skip dialogue option -No controller support -Typical progression walls -Junk side content -Horrible rates Fun side game. I expect most will drop at endgame when they realize it's just another grind machine to smash more and more artificial walls that's considered content. Solid 7. You'll see.",Positive
"Honestly I did not expect this game to be even better than genshin impact. The gameplay is actually really fun, the gacha is way easier to access and get more characters since they added quite a lot of features that are way better than genshin's, and also you get so much more rewards, like almost triple or double. This game is just so good so I can't give it any less than 5 stars.",Positive
"Loved it when I first played it, but the grind just got way too boring and the return rate for spending Stellar Jade on Rail tickets was never enough. It pushes so hard for whaling, so I'm gonna leave it to them, as it's just not made for the average/casual user üò© Rich people only! Trailblazer return rewards are also just awful, the survey is an utter waste of time. After the initial Stellar Jade TR rewards are received, it's back to the boring grind.",Negative
"Unplayable, picked up first yellow item on the dungeon and game got hard stuck and couldn't tap out, how?",Negative
"this game is always stuck up in the base station. what should I do to explore in other places, it's boring, there's no activity.",Negative
"It's gorgeous, very nice Japanese dub. I really enjoy the story. But it somehow lacks something and I don't know what. When it comes to pulls I never had such bad luck in hundreds of games. I don't know if it's ment to be like that bu in 100 pulls I would expect at least one 5 star. I might play it once in a while",Negative
Overall the gameplay is good. Yet the main problem is the error in logging in even though I have tried logging out for a while and get back in. Hopefully this would be fixed.,Negative
"Best Game ever,Still Playing Until Today Hope I can Get to play this game Untill Eos.",Positive
"Wonderful game, I love hoyoverse games as always they dilived well on this one! Gameplay - 9/10, new gameplay feels relay good and newbie friendly Story (thus far)- 8/10 Character design - 9.5/10 Music/ost - 10/10 I love how characters show expressions during dialogues, cutscenes and even battle. I loved the EN dub I have yet to try other dubs but JP is perfect as always",Positive
"This and genshin impact changed my life for the greater good. I love these games so much, they're absolutely perfect.",Positive
Love it! The gameplay is really cool and give off more of a chill vibe than the one on genshin. The only problem is that ever since the 1.5ver update it stops running on Intel device.,Negative
"Well polished game with a fantastic sci-fi setting. HSR probably has the best writing of all Hoyoverse games from the start, and is easily on par with AAA paid titles. Turn-based combat is well done and surprisingly engaging. Characters are gorgeously designed with excellent writing.",Positive
"Best game I've ever played, this is my favorite game of all time, and I absolutely love the characters and their personalities.",Positive
"Man it is a master piece. People might complain it is not like genshin but srsly it is a total different game and the combat system, graphics, character design, skill is far better than genshin u get a super good gaming experience even if it is not a open world . (So stop complaining this is not genshin it is a total different game )",Positive
Saw reviews about the game and today decided to try why one star it has been over 15 mins and all I can witness is a train traveling the universe. Give props for the new vision for a mobile game but conversations to small to read. Hope to see improvements may try again. Great voice and animation.,Negative
"Overall, just a great game. Beautiful characters and worlds, awesome voices actors across different languages, no need to pay money, easy to use interface, what else could you want?",Positive
Game doesn't work. Won't go beyond the start screen showing the train and the asteroids.,Negative
"I was really looking forward to playing this game until I happened to read the permissions for this game. I have no idea why this game requires access to my camera to take pictures and video, change my network connectivity, or even use my flashlight, but some of these permissions seem like an invasion of privacy. And I've heard people say ""oh, it's to better the game experience"", but there is a difference between improving a game and knowing everything about your player.",Negative
I've waited for this game to release since 10 months ago but now i cant even play it the game keep kicks me out when im trying to download the data... pls make it compatible for low end devices maybe change the log in screen to non-moving one to reduce the lag i rlly want to play this game :(((( and i dont have the money to buy new phone,Positive
"Pretty visual, great story, nice turn-based system. Really could be improved on the mechanics though, the turn based system is not novel at all.",Positive
"OK Hands down one of the BEST JRPGs I have ever played, the gameplay is engaging, the story is so interesting and the characters are just so darn cool! For anybody who is a fan of JRPGs give this game a try and if u are a fan of genshin u will def be a fan of this game!! (Note* I've played this prob for at least 7hrs so far so this is an early review but if u can't tell I'm having a great time so far!)",Positive
Its high quality among all the gacha games on the market. Kinda stingy but it is what it is. (Its a hoyothing but you can get by with whats given to you),Positive
It has a great storyline. SUNDAY WILL BE PLAYABLE TRUST,Positive
"0/10 gacha , the pulls feel like garbage needing obscene luck to get a 5 star character only layered by another luck factor of getting a good/wanted character , 5/10 story, pretty bland stuff a lot of unecesarry fights , 9/10 character design, the artstyle is very good and the different places you go to look amazing , honestly the only good part about the game , 7/10 gameplay , its grindy but somewhat enjoyable , progressing the story after a while feels like a brick wall hitting game , 3/10",Negative
"rating this a 1 star for now. whenever i try to log in and start the game, it always says ""login error"" and i don't even know why. i've tried logging in lots of times but it still shows the same thing whenever i try to start the game. it's getting pretty annoying. edit: i'm giving this a 4 star now because i can finally log in, but minus one star because i still have to deal with the ""login error"" for like 2-3 times before i can actually log in to the game.",Positive
"plsss help mee mihoyo, the background of my game keeps disappearing, and i see others struggling with the same issue, i waited till the new update where the new danheng with horns one but its still the same, i had also tried clearing the data and let it download new files but its still the same. i had also tried uninstalled it but its still not working plss do something mihoyo. the bug is like, the train is quite long to the edge of the screen but mine just cuts it in half.. plss help fix this!!",Negative
"Have been playing since release date, The game was very great but they are times that I get bored of it but kept playing everyday. It lacks content for end game players like me and relics grinding was very hard to us p2w so do somehing about it? And is it possible if the characters will have skins soon?? Overall the game was very great!!",Positive
"at first I thought it was lagging but no, it was lagging during the internal download, after the internal download was finished it didn't lag and after I played it it was the best like other games honkai impact and genshin impact and the character part is really beautiful and handsome fuhh it's really a power game ‚ù§Ô∏è and this my review üò© good game developers üòè",Positive
"I haven't fully understood the game but in a ad it said I could get 80 warps and I thought ""hmm maybe I could use this 80 warps to begin playing"" so I download and get nothing. I don't know why, but no 80 warps for me. So, 1 star minus, for I guess baiting and lying to people of the ad, but please tell me how to get 80 warps for free, and I fix this post.",Positive
"I really love the game, it's one of my favourites, but the space it takes on my phone it's a lot, half of my memory, and it makes me incapable of playing. I was looking forward to Robin and Boothill, and the new updates. Guess It should be for the next time.",Negative
"IVE PLAYED FOR 11 DAYS ALREADY, I LOVE THIS. THE PUZZELS, MAPS CHARACTERA, AND EVERYTHING IS SO COOL!! PLEASEEEEE MAKE MORE. YOU HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT. NO MATTER WHAT ILL TRY TO LOVE IT. I LOVE YU MIHOYOüî•üî•",Positive
"Initial download the game crashed twice, once I managed to download everything clicked to start game and continued to crash with even loading into the game. Think its worthy of 2 stars since I can't even play",Negative
The gameplay? As good as turnbased can be. The characters? Since its made by hoyo of course they all look great~! Their animations are good too! Something I like about this is that ur chars don't turn chibi when in combat which is unlike other gacha tb games and makes it unique imo. Now the chat system actually fixes Gi char problems because here you're not hoping for quests just to get to know ur char. In here u can get to know and bond with them better~ would've wrote more if I could lmao XD,Positive
"This is really badass game, actually in the first plays i thought this game is bad because its turn base game, almost 2 years of playing genshin impact that is why i prefer real time rpg but but when i progress in hsr I'm shocked because the storyline is great, the plot is great, graphics and the character design this game is 100% 10/10, so yeah‚ù§Ô∏è, keep it up developersüíóüíóüíìüíìüíì",Positive
"Love this game, although, I suggest the game produces more stellar jades for pulling the characters.",Positive
"I'm really sorry for this rating. I'm casually playing the game then suddenly it says error 1001_1. I don't know what to do, I restarted and check my data and it's all good. I cleared the gacha and data but still showing the error sign. I don't want to delete the game because I love it. If this still occurs then I have no choice but to delete it. Hopefully you guys can help me.",Negative
Absolutely amazing way worth your time 100% better than genshin impact from what I've experienced so far I'm trailblaze 40 and still absolutely loving this game the characters look amazing and is full of what feels like endless content and that's coming from someone who plays on a potato laptop with lag such a good game that it's worth it,Positive
Very good story telling and nice characters. Maybe there can be more than just two attacks. And I very miss a function to individualise your character.,Positive
Been playing it for months and still loving it till dis day!!! Edit: Game is overall still enjoyable,Positive
Graphic =perfect Story = little long but is very exciting Gameplay = it's somehow strategic and action and after a playing many times it could be boring but this game has lots of event and mini game and they are exciting,Positive
It's a fun experience even a year later. Abaolutely love the new additions every other update,Positive
"Any maps I play on Hard or higher difficulty I get this weird lag where it makes me occasionally miss notes that I definitely hit correctly. I can't complete any songs and it's frustrating. I have a Galaxy s23+ and never had this issue on my old s10...I play on Lite and shut off effects, close all other background apps etc. I still have problems.",Negative
"Very fun,have a good arstyle,cute characters,good plot ,love everything",Positive
I have mobile network but i cannot open it say network connection always.,Negative
"character designs, storyline and everything's amazing. perfect to kill time with and you don't need to constantly be active to save your trailblazer energy since the game stores it for you. love it",Positive
"Game stuck at that train in space scene. I don't know if it froze completely or if it just takes way too long to sync, either way there was no information regarding loadtime. Unacceptable and a waste of time.",Negative
High quality cash grab. Writing and RPG elements are unreasonably good for a gacha game.,Positive
"I love the characters and the story, having a mix of open world and turn based fighting is really a good change for a genshin player like me :) and I also really appreciate the way there would be random messages at times from our friends like March 7th and Dan Heng, and the game is generous too, keep up the good work hoyoverse <3",Positive
"Love this game very much . Graphic are insane , the gameplay is very satisfying and the battle is very strategic. Moreover, the story is very epic and dramatic. Keep up the good work @Hoyoverse . Hopefully more excitement and suprising update will be more and more merrier.",Positive
"Simply the most amazing game I've played on mobile, and I've played almost all searching for a game like this. Beautiful graphics, immersive story, no real limit on gameplay and good community. I can't say enough.",Positive
"It's a good game. The playstyle is my type, and the characters design are amazing - animations badass as well. Looking forward for the future of this wonderful game, continue walking the right path, Trailblazers! üëç",Positive
"hoyoverse please fix this , the train werent showing up , is it a bug? , if you fix this issue , thank you , ill be giving 5 star",Positive
"I absolutely love it. The game is like a breath of fresh air. The characters, story, the music (the biggest highlight) everything is spectacular. The game is one of the best of it's genre. Definitely recommended, go for it!",Positive
"graphics are awesome, smooth, i have just tried this game and basically you take turns to attack people, which really isnt my type of game, it had really good potential and amazing graphics, if you like turn making games this game is for you, its one of the best turn making games i have seen, with amazing graphics, again this isnt my type of game (: .",Negative
I did enjoy this game in the beginning since the art and story made the game come to life however after playing for a while the game becomes boring and hard since your team won't hit big number and their is so many and I mean a lot of stats that affect each character. For me also I felt that I can get my character but the artifacts is a lot harder to get certain substats I feel that this game has potential but I do not think I would play this game tbh,Negative
"Gallagher is gone and now I need therapy. Unplayable and uninstall because he's gone. He's the best character ever and it was unnecessary to erase him. Yes, he's playable, but he is canonically gone which sucks. He's a great, he's handsome, I wish it would've been different.",Negative
"Great game, as much as I enjoyed Genshin it got a bit overwhelming for me personally and took up too much of my time. I prefer this more linear style and love the turn-based battles. Really enjoying it",Positive
"UPDATED: Thank you for the upcoming free Dr. Ratio!! What a nice gift from the devs. Keep it up and continue to make great content!! üòä Enjoying the storyline, the characters and the game features. Hoping for more exciting content and challenges. Also improving QOL and optimization on mobile in the future patches. üëçüëç",Positive
"Im telling you people, Honkai Star Rail is better than Genshin Impact. Yes, Genshin might be a little better if you want greener scenery but Honkai Star Rail's wishing system and character design surpass Genshin, I say. Absolutely love this app and how you can farm with the help of your friend's characters. That way you can try out other characters at the same time and help your friend get rewards. Also love that you can just press auto and afk sometimes. 5 stars forever!",Positive
"This game is wasted on a mobile device. Talk about not improving. You can fix the quality. You can fix the farming issues, centered around an obvious plot. There are so many things that can be done, refuse, LISTEN to the common voice.",Negative
"One of the best games i played so far, this is a good game but im giving it a 4 star because there are some bugs or issue while playing the game one of it is that it randomly freezes on cutscene, please fix this thank you",Positive
"The game is pretty good, I honestly like the characters and stuff. The characters are handsome, especially ‚òÜblade‚òÜ<3. I find it good that you can have a support character in your team when you're farming for relics and stuff.",Positive
The crash issue in loading screen has been solved. Game can be played again like usual. But there is a bug or whatever it is when battling stages in MOC suddenly it can be supeerrr laggy and end up force close again.,Negative
The title screen is unnecesarily heavy. Please add an option to make static title screen. Even the main game is not as heavy as the title/loading screen. I've played on pc since release but the mobile version is way too heavy.,Negative
"This game is good but it lags and crashes when you want to fight. This is not the first time I get a crash when I want to fight, sometimes when I want to upgrade my character it also crashes.",Positive
Love love the game! Although I have experience more crashes and glitches since 2.0. Hope the team can get on this so the experience is a bit smoother!,Positive
"Combat is top tier. World building is top tier. Gacha system is ridiculous. I hate using that word, but I won't be investing more time as the drop rates are awful for anything or anyone useful. I haven't had a character drop in the last four banners.",Negative
"Very mid experience that peaks after first area, inconsistent interactions with characters post quest lines resulting in conflicting information. Strange voice acting inconsistencies within side quests where characters will randomly talk but then be not voiced the next dialogue.",Negative
I played on the first few months after release. I finished the first planet and stopped playing for weeks. When I was gonna return only to find out my account got deleted. It was confirmed by their CS. I never deleted my account on any games ever. Thanks for the first few months. Will not play it again from the start.,Negative
being playing for nearly 6 months. Still enjoying it. would like more ways to get trace materials so I can play with other characters. Good visuals and story,Positive
"As for today after penacony update the game keep getting shut down while playing simulated universe, and it increasingly annoying since usually i clear SU very fast, but because of this bug, it kind of annoying to login again and again after the app getting crash and shut down by itself..",Negative
"One of the best game i ever played. The graphic is eye candy, the gameplay is fun (and comfortable for casual players), the devs and the community is very great, also the story is the best. 10/10 should play.",Positive
after the newest update the game sometimes crash while i was playing there was time when i was in simulated world and it happened my used skill point didnt return and i lose the raid... wasted so much of my time and ruin my mood. i dont have problem like this before that update sigh...,Positive
"Different take at the turn based combat genre.Even the story is different than your usual gacha game it has up's and down on story but when the story hits it's gonna be one of a kind, very free to play as well, most of the characters is insanely strong.Thanks for making a great game Hoyo.",Positive
"Personally as a Pokemon games lover, the turn based combat system felt really good. And the story of this game is really awesome, the background track. Everything is just so good.",Positive
"Since im so busy with life now but still want to play game, honkai star rail helps me a lot. The auto battle really conventional to me. I still can log in n do daily missions while doing my works every day. During weekend, i'll do the event or any quests.. Still enjoy it even though im busy.ü§≠",Positive
One of the most laid back fun hoyoverse game i have ever played! Though the bad thing is that the mobile version needs a high end device since lower end devices tend to lag and not load the environment,Positive
Ok I play this game all the time.with that said I'll say this DO NOT waste your time pre-downloading the resource package when there is an update that requires you to update the apk from the play store (maybe it's just me) because it will for some reason give you a log in error after the title screen I haven't the slightest idea as to why,Negative
"This is one of the best game I have played, the art style is 5/5 ,the character design is 5/5 ,gameplay is 5/5, but the summoning system is 4/5 as it is hard to get summaning meterial & chances of 5star character is low but othe wise ths is one of the best F2P game And the story of the game is great to I hope is stays like this or get better",Positive
"Turn based gacha game, if you're into that you'll love it. You can earn a lot of the rewards without spending which is nice. Very story driven with plenty of side quests. Overall a great game for mobile.",Positive
"Got this on ps5 so I thought I would download on phone s22+ to carry on the story while on the go. But it seems to keep crashing which is a shame, as I would love to be able to keep playing on phone when I can't get to ps5. Hopefully it will be sorted soon üòä",Negative
"One of the best game available on mobile, whether it is by story, graphics, music, deepness of the lore... Star rail is a really complete experience. I had exactly zero issue on my device (Xiaomi mi 14) and I've been playing (On this device) for months",Positive
"I love the game , really good lore , cutscenes , character, only problem is that the game has lots of graphics glitch and a lot of time stops working , I know it might be due to my phone butt still i hope u guys fix this I want to play this game",Positive
"I like the story of the game, gameplay is also pretty good we also get lots of free rewards and the character design are top tier, but i sometimes face login issues and the optimisation of this game is not great at all",Positive
"I personally love this game. I've been playing star rail since it came out and I can say it gets boring after a while, you know? When you finish all quests and stuff. I love the character designs and the story I guess. Please let me get Blade's light cone üôèüôèüôè",Positive
"It lags during cutscenes, and it takes a lot of space, but aside from that, it is fun and has a really good story.If you end up playing, have fun trailblazing.",Positive
The game is quite fun and this is my first experience of actually delving into a game with a story. The character designs look great and the combat system is fun. Looks like Hoyo is really putting up their best effort for this game,Positive
"Story is starting out good, but the more we are into the story, I feel like being punished for not playing the previous Honkai game. I feel like missing a big chunk of information and it really takes my enjoyment away, be it inside the game and in community. Sorry, but I have to drop this game. I don't want to spend my time playing a (previous) game I'm not interested in just to understand this one.",Negative
"Hello ,I have been playing hsr for a mouth now and I am constantly facing the problem of game stoping in between it's really annoying, since I have to restart the game every time it happens and trust me it happens quite often I have never faced this type of problem while playing genshin on my Android phone ,sadly I have to back to playing genshin if it's not for this problem I would have stayed longer except for this HSR is definitely the best turn based gacha out there love it 5/5.",Negative
"Not bad, but moves way too slow for me. I'm more interested in the game aspect than the story. This is big on story and has long pauses of storyline you are forced to go through and cannot skip.",Positive
"This is my new favorite mobile RPG. I have been experiencing frequent crashes with the recent update, but the game is good enough that I'm willing to stick with it while they work out the bugs.",Positive
"Oh my god, this one just exciting, fun and addicting! Love the graphics, cutscenes, mechanisms, puzzle and a lot of references. Hope this journey will be an awesome one.",Positive
"Hello, I love this game and the model (details) r amazing but when everytime I try to fight a boss/enemy. It will kick me out sometimes, Please fix this because it's kinda getting annoying.",Positive
"Definitely the best game to play than Genshin Impact. It seems like this game is an unserious playground for Hoyo Developers. The quests is mostly summarized than Genshin's long dialogue, and even with limited exploration, the treasures are really bountiful with jades. The events that you missed can still be playable, Hoyo should improve the reward system in Genshin but if this is about being equity in Hoyo's games then I understand. Still being the best game.",Positive
"Lately 1 out of times i entered combat the game crashes. Please fix this. It is really annoying that once in a while, I have to open the game again.",Negative
"I don't know what changed recently, but the past few weeks this game lives to crash and freeze. I have a feeling they'll fix it soon though otherwise, this would be 5/5.",Negative
"It's fun and good, the graphics are amazing , the only thing I don't like is the turn based style but oh well, also it has great rewards and features unlike some other game from this same billion dollar company",Positive
Too much content with very slow progression system. It takes forever to clear content and sometimes you cant beat story because you are underpowered. No skill needed since its turn based combat,Negative
"I love this game. But when I came back after 4 months of not playing hsr. I used my Facebook account to play hsr, but when I came back and logged in again, it just restarted and I'm disappointed because I've been using that account for 6 months and when I came back all of it is gone. My wasted time. I hope you fix this hsr",Negative
"The game is rly fun, i can still grind in auto mode while doing school works. The design is good as well as the storyline but ever since i updated the latest version the game kept crashing pls fix T_T",Positive
The only problem I see with this game is summoning rates are terrible too low. The pity rate is set too high. The amount of free pulls given to you is so low it's laughable. Even with the 80 free pulls they are advertising 40-50 of those come from getting to max level. They gave me 20 free pulls from the start but they were not even gold tickets they were silver tickets. That's the only bad thing about this game comes down to the summoning flaws and them not giving out enough free pulls.,Negative
"Superb for a Mihoyo fan, may be also great for someone, who did not met with the Mihoyoverse before. Story although interesting in the beginning is somewhat boring at times and character naming is confusing (looks like alternate reality to the one from HI3). I recommend you to try this one and make your own judgment. P.S. Updated to 3 stars: Each new world apart the first one is less enjoyable and increasingly boring and filled with meaningless dialogues.",Negative
Hsr is a very good turn based game all the turn based games that I used to play are very p2w and hsr is perfect for Me the audio the animation and the gacha system seprised me because it's all f2p the game doesn't have adds so everything is not annoying some bugs change and ruin the game but if you contact mi hoyo on there website or email you can inform the developers about the problem and they will get to fixing those bugs honestly i like this as a genshin it's too good this is perfect for mee,Positive
recommended game for you who have a busy schedule but want to relax a bit. i love this game so much because it always have enough content and easy to play. anyone who loves turn based combat will love this game.,Positive
This game is really fun and the animantion so smooth i love this game so much but..when i want to play this game is really long i have to wait for an hour and the data update just can't finish 100% is stop then has error message say that the storage need to delete so i try many time i had deleted and try again and again but still didn't work im so sad about this game and mad too i hope you understand and fix it,Negative
"There is so much content, it's amazing, the music is beautiful , the gameplay is thrilling, and the rewards are generous. I wish for the quality of the next updates to be at the same level of the last one. It's a pleasure playing this game.",Positive
This game is very good and the graphics is also really impressed for mobile and I also love the characters design they're all very good but can you please add Kafka and Blade back to the game so I can draw for it I haven't download at the time of the release date,Positive
"Great visuals, straightforward turn-based gameplay. Only complaint is the gear RNG. Getting a decent piece only for the rolls to go into flat def is... not a good feeling.",Positive
"after deleting and redownloading this game, all of which was done on the same google play account, my saved data has reverted to an earlier save and I have lost everything. However, my Genshin Impact account, again played on through the same Google play account, still has my old data. what the heck?",Negative
"I love this game, however since the latest update this now only crashes and doesn't even get past loading the resources for the game. I'm running it on a Samsung s22 ultra, there's nothing at all that has changed on my device, so unfortunately the problem lies with the latest update",Negative
"Very fun game, awesome graphics, and a very interesting story. Also, if you want a game that shows some skin..(*_*; and to those Karen's reading this, NO, THERE ISN'T ANY NUDITY (yet*) *hint hint developers. ( Ôºõ-ÔΩÄ–¥¬¥-)",Positive
The game is fun and gives me a lot of rewards. The storylines are fun and enjoyable since not only that it gives a well deserve awards but it also has unique plots and stories that can be witty or dramatic,Positive
"I don't like the play style. I understand if some people my like it, but what's the point of me fighting? If I don't get to choose who in my team goes next, I feel useless when fighting games are like this, and the story suffocates me in a sea of lines things happen fast and I don't understand",Negative
"Game keeps crashing, cant even have it open once its loaded more than 2minutes begore it crashes. I have tried restarting my phone and app but its of no use. I cant even open any of the menus.",Negative
This game is fantastic if you love turn based RPGs. It's also extremely free to play friendly and really makes you feel like your time is valued. The devs really do a great job and I love the new worlds. They are really vibrant and full of life. I'm a really picker gamer so this is high praise from me. Great job Mihoyo!,Positive
"Downloaded this because I wanted to try playing on my phone with the progress I have on my PS5, so I create an account, try to link it, turns out you have to *create* the account directly through the PS5, because, for some reason, it won't let you link with existing accounts, so you HAVE to make one on the PS5, so I delete the account I just made, and now I have to wait 30 days for the account to get deleted to be able to try again. Amazing. Thank you.",Negative
I'd give this game 5 stars but farming for relic is the worst thing ever. You grind for hours just to get something mediocre most of the time. You barley get any resin to craft a piece with the main stat you want and even then there's no garentee that the substats will be good. This is only problem with the game and the devs probably aren't going to change it because they count on the whales to spend money on energy to keep farming for the perfect piece. Please increase drop rate for some stats.,Positive
"Let me start by saying, I want to enjoy this game. I like the combat style and the writing has charm, but another potentially good game is ruined by gatcha. I played long enough to do 100 pulls (Ten 10-warps) and was reminded that to actually play characters you want, you have to get lucky or shell out a load of money and still hope to get lucky, considering the only SSR character I was given in 100 warps was the guaranteed one at the end of the 5 reduced cost pulls. I can't recommend this game.",Negative
"Good customer service, fast response time and the way they handle my problem was good. This is a fun game, I like it a lot. Good characters , setting and story. The gacha is... Ok other than the way gacha is handled (super stingy) I love it .",Positive
I love this game. Everything about game content is fantastic. My only issue is that it causes my devices to get very warm. I have been playing for months and I am still enjoying this game. If you're into RPG'S you must have this in your library. Enjoy üòâ,Positive
"I have written this review just to address a fatal flaw with the game. So I am on the Jarilo VI, and i am doing the mission The Eighth and Final Rule. I go to Sampo's location and..... Sampo is nowhere to be found. I am extremely irritated because of this due to the fact I cannot progress with the game because of this simple bug. I may have to resort to resetting my progress but alas, please fix this",Negative
"Poorly optimized game, uses way too much memory for a turn based RPG, I am using a 695 5g 8core processor with 6 gigs of ram and a 4 gig RAM boost spend more on your game rather than marketing and I'll be happy to come back and give money as it stands I'm not playing a mobile game on a platform where I keep real games",Negative
A very good game which requires a lot of mind play and strategy. It is also easy to grind for materials and has a vast world to explore and many enemies to defeat,Positive
üíØü•∞ü¶ã‚ù£Ô∏èüåπTruly I am in love with this game. It's so hard to find a game with full size characters and being able to fight other characters and walk and run to places. Thank you for creating a timeless masterpiece! ü•π,Positive
"It's a very good game, but when I download it on my new phone half of the train dissaperdü§£ü§£. And the map is broken, about 78% of it dissaperd but I can still walk and hit the invisible wall. So PLS fix this for me, and I'll give 5 star :)",Negative
I really like this game but please fix the invisible textures in penacony i can still continue the story but its confusing to solve like path puzzles because i cant see any doors floors and the walls this is also happening on my laptop please do something about it,Positive
Edit: I finally got a device to run Star Rail and Oh boi WHATD I MISS! The game is still so much fun and really well done! The backgrounds are so stunning although the character designs are kinda repeaty atleast the new ones at Penacony looks so great! And y'all delivered!! Loving the game as much as I did the first time i played the game. Cheers!,Positive
"I watched the 1st anniversary stream. It was good but I am disappointed. I wish they would have given us a 5 star character selecter. like on that selecter we would have the characters that had already had their rerun like seele, Kafka, blade, silverwolf and maybe one 5star from the standard banner. or they could have gone with the mix of rerun and standard banner 5 star characters. and they could have given us the selecter as the reward for some in game event where we participate. üòûüòûüòû",Positive
The main story quests are pretty good so far. Doing dailies and weeklies are much more convenient than in Genshin Impact as of version 2.0. The map design and character design are top notch for a Hoyoverse game at the level of Honkai Impact 3rd. üëç,Positive
"Lots of Elating lore, Eazy gameplay to understand, Exploring is rewarded, Intriguing characters, Fun mini-games and events imo, Immersive zones, Generous Dev's, Silly humor, Farming worthwhile Sub-Stats for relic's is difficult tho. Give it a try :]",Positive
So far it's a good game however. I am very worried at the rate of power creep... The energy system is like other Mihoyo games except HI3. Very limiting for those who are active. Don't expect this to be a main game unless a major update drops. This is more of a sub Gacha game.,Positive
"It good game and everything but I ain't going to download it on phone since too many downloads and I don't have patience for that, not bad game just I'm not going to deal with so many downloads I thought I finished until suddenly another huge download, I'm good but if you have good wifi and fast Internet be my guest and play it.",Negative
"Edit: Freezes after login, doesn't even proceed to a loading screen before it force closes, cannot get to settings or anything else. Samsung S22. Haven't even been able to play, downloaded, logged in and then won't get past 15% for downloading resources because it freezes and then force closes.",Negative
"The update doesn't work. I've tried updating it for a few hours now. Even by uninstalling the game and reinstalling it back, but it doesn't work. I've already checked my phone's storage and etc.",Negative
"In this latest patch i encountered so many screen freeze mid fight, and it's really annoying, i had to restart the game and start the battle all over again. Only in this latest patch, it was fine in 1.6. Please fix.",Positive
"Well, it's suprisingly good yet interesting but I'm a bit unsatisfied, that everytime when almost logging in the game. It always gets out from the app!.. even though it's a bit annoying, I still liked how interesting the story was.",Positive
I really enjoy most of it but I often experience stuttering in almost ALL the cutscenes which really ruins the experience for me who just wants to enjoy the story.,Negative
Really wish the login screen didnt solo tank the hardware requirement this badly lmao. Felt like back in few betas ago the title screen dont even have the lag issues. Could really help having non particle spam version of the trails in main menu.,Positive
"Good day, I play this on my pc and I played it alot on my old phone(samsung 21FE) and it worked perfectly, I have now upgraded my phone to the samsung 23FE and the game freezes every 3 mins how can this now not work on the new device? I have been playimg since launch and this is now hindering my progress.. please advise when fix will be implemented.",Negative
"It's a really good game, No problem in Downloading and During Gameplay Good Graphics and Voicelines, Especially the English and Jp Va 80 free pulls wasn't a lie, you can get it the more you play, Good Job Devs. but i don't think It is made for low end phones that's why there's so many complaints about it. For negative reviewers get a job and buy better phones. Lol.",Positive
"It's a best rig game I play, character are very good but their level up is bit difficult. You can't continue the story until you level up. BTW game is favorite üòÖüòÖüòÖ",Positive
"The game is great, The graphics are pretty, but I always encounter a bug that makes the textures invisible. Please fix this,",Positive
"It took me a couple of tries to get into this game, but man, I am addicted. Hsr is so much more generous than genshin. The story is phenomenal. I love the characters. Earning Jade is so easy. And the auto battle feature for those who hate fighting 24/7? Chefs kiss.",Positive
"Play the game since April , I never try any turn base game before but this one grab my attention , I really like the character design . The story telling is well made and have impactful scene. I hope there is more to come in this game ><",Positive
"Hello there.I've been playing Honkai Star Rail for over a year so far with no issues.But I just encountered a problem today.The game kept stating to reboot due to a ""network error"". So I am confused since my internet is working just fine.Anyways,thank you in advance for taking you're time to read and respond to my comment.Have a good day.",Positive
First few minutes into the game and it crashes mid fight. Got killed and was waiting for it to load for like 2 minutes.üò≠ Looks cool but that little moment made me frustrated and I deleted the game. üôÅ,Negative
"immaculate. gorgeous characters, if not for a lack of representation (as with most hoyo games). turn-based but not in an unbearable way. it's incredibly fun, and beautiful, and by god are these devs generous.",Positive
"My hsr penacony map didn't fully load, I restart my pc like 2 times, and it still didn't load, what do I do with it. I can't see the ground and wall. Plz help it's hard to explore my map if I can't see the route",Negative
"I love this game since it was first release, i often play this game when i have some free time, i absolutely love the new characters, new updates, and the story quest aswell! I overall rate this game 5 stars. Good job Hoyoverse for this game! (This game drains my money haha)",Positive
"This sucks. I'm going back to Arknights Pros: -fun character designs -genuinely impressive graphics and animation for a gacha game -remarkably good voice acting -combat has just enough strategy to keep you engaged -tutorial does a decent job onboarding new players Cons: -Ui is a mess, especially the store -light cones. The drop tables are watered down to nothing with the f'ers. I did a bunch of 10-pulls with the starting tickets they gave me and had multiple 10-pulls with 0 characters",Negative
"I LOVE IT!!! This game is absolutely amazing!! I cant get enough, the characters, the missions, the music, EVERYTHING is stellar!!! 10/10 would highly recommend!! :3",Positive
"Awesome job with this game. Art and gameplay are in the top. However, some content are very repetitive and unrewarding. Meanwhile, the best rewards are locked behind setting up strong teams which you cant set up because it takes months to reach that level and a big wallet to pull the characters. Edit: I appreciate that we have more free rewards but events are still too low and the gacha is still at predatory levels. Aether Gazer in 2.6 will have the best gacha system around with a 90 guarantee.",Negative
"Playing since the official release - fun gameplay comparable with fights in the Persona series! Also a better story than Twilight. Update: Gameplay gets repetitive and boring, skill caps are too high.",Negative
Difficulty spike in story mode too high. Not much abundance unit had debuff cleanse and most of if are premium unit while STORY boss had bunch of crippiling debuff. Character naming sense also horrible. Please dont translate character name. For example hanabi and hotaru sounds like actual name but when you translate it to sparkle and firefly its sounds like stripper stage name. Just pick western or eastern name and stick with it. Skill desc also too long and confusing. Simplified it,Negative
"Such a fun game. Also a lot more rewarding than genshin impact, graphics is also really great and the fighting style is okay, puzzles are way too easy sometimes though.",Positive
"Pls fix this bug, the beginning of the game the place that you can't go into suddenly opened and i enter it but the moment i started exploring the area it trapped me i was in the farm of the beginning of the game pls fix it i cant progress longer if I'm stuck üò≠üò≠",Negative
The game is really good I swear but the major problem is that it keeps lagging and crashing hoping that y'all can fix that issue it's been 5 months and still the issue hasn't yet been fixed I wanna play it so badly,Negative
"Amazing storytelling and art. I've been playing for almost a year, and every major world update brings so much more to the table..Penacony sets the bar extremely high! As far as gacha rewards go, HoYo is extremely generous compared to other companies.",Positive
"In short, I love the fighting style in game, music, and interaction with the NPCs in side quests, but after finishing boss fight with the Svarog's character, it'll slowly turn into a P2W game. So, brace yourself if you think about playing without paying.",Positive
"game keeps crashing despite my phone specs being great, clearing my cache multiple times, restarting my phone and uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Will not be reinstalling for some time.",Negative
"Best F2P game I have ever played. They give generous rewards. Easy to Difficult gameplay. There are tons of end-game content, and the story is quite good. The story is mature and deep.",Positive
"The fights are too hard, I literally spent over an hour to defeat a monster; the game doesn't involve you; the battle turns makes it boring and the only reason why I gave 2 stars is the rewards, when you least expect it you are given 10 wishes, clearly the favorite child of mihoyo.",Negative
"I played this game since release and stopped playing after a year. My phones battery drains like no tomorrow, and it heats up my phone like its going to set on fire. Not only that the game itself it is huge and continues to get bigger with every update. How can this be a mobile game with the amount of GBs this needs",Negative
"I absolutely love this game. However, while downloading the new update my game keeps crashing less than 1 minute in and I can't do anything, my phone has more than enough space for the update and it makes no sense. I was hoping there was some way to fix this?",Negative
"I feel like you really need to check the writing of this game, because some things in the storyline don't add up, like how Jingliu's story just added more confusion than anything. Not to mention the fact that you brought *real discrimination* into a game with Sparkle, which was not really a great move. Other than that, the gameplay is fine, albeit laggy during cutscenes...",Negative
"Honkai: Star Rail is a great fantasy sci-fi game. I'd recommend it if your into that! there's loads of story to go through... (Depending on your playstyle). A bunch of hidden things, and a bunch of characters to like. Great job.",Positive
"I'd love to tell you about the game; it has a pretty home screen but half an hour of googling Reddit results and I still fail to make it run for more than a minute without crashing, on a Galaxy S23. I've got to give it 1 star by default.",Negative
"Whenever I am in middle of fights, the game suddenly have connection problems even though my internet speed just fine. And whenever I try to login again, it gave me errors. Please fix this! I am in Asia server using Phone Poco X3 Pro.",Negative
"Nice fun game that doesn't require insane upkeep. Dailies take 5-10 minutes max. Takes a little work to get a team going, but once you do it's not bad at all.",Positive
"Every content that offers Stellar Jades are almost unbeatable on higher levels now. Old characters are easily outmatched by newer characters in terms of meta. So far the worst game direction, I would give this zero stars if I can. After attaining the game of the year, everything is mid to garbage tier now. Genshin has significantly better balance than this.",Negative
"I can't even play the game. I have never downloaded this game before so I've obviously never played it before but I tried 3 different email addresses to make an account and all are ""already in use"". I even changed the pw for them incase someone used my email and it still won't let me log in. I have no idea what the issue is, I've never had this problem with any other game. I'm not wasting another second on an inept game.",Negative
"Unfortunately i leave bad rate since i should uninstall this game twice. I cant enjoy the story,event too bored and weird, Late game content need specific character to pass, and s### always lose rate off !!!",Negative
"Great characters design, cool animation skill and better gameplay than other game (only my own opinion) well, more or less, this game totally can be categorize on top role playing game and I hope more up coming update can make this game get more better.",Positive
"Game is Phenomenal but it won't work on my brand new Android Tablet. Just bought my tablet today and tried downloading it but it will say error downloading resources and it won't fox itself. I've tried deleting it and installing it again, but nothing. Really hope this gets fixed.",Negative
"I tried to like this game but can't. Get bored pretty fast. I like the visual, character design & easy daily mission. But that's all. Story is so-so. Sometimes the conversation/lines are forced to be funny. You're forced to bond with pink Paimon who somehow end up taking more spotlight in cutscene & dialogue than the protagonist itself. Okay, protag is introvert. But give other character their moment to shine. You have many. No comment about gacha. Overall I prefer genshin.",Negative
The game keeps crashing all of a sudden Everytime I go into battle in mid fight the game will crash and I'd have to start over that's really irritating and annoying considering it didn't do that before,Negative
tbh I really like the rewards and getting a 10 pull every update is really amazing as someone who reall sucks at saving jades or primos üòÄüíî,Positive
"This is what I feel. 1) the cut seen is good 2) the story is complete and interesting 3) the gameplay is a bit boring 4) we can use a friend's character to get the material, this is very helpful to me.",Positive
The writing is amazing and full of my type of humor lol. The game have a lot of improvement that I hope was in genshin... Still hoping that genshin will adapt some of hsr mechanic such as the specific artifacts synthesis and everyday dungeon to make it easier to grind and farm. The trailblazer or the mc can be the most op and useful in game and still be use late game which is amazing since the trailblazer are hot so I want them always on my team Hahaha.,Positive
over 60 pulls for the new character and still nothing. the drop rate is horrible.,Negative
The graphics and story is great but the battle it's sucks it's like a old game the you wait for your turn to hit I hate game like that,Negative
"Very well put together game, doesn't demand too much time. Turn based gameplay but doesn't become stale, gotcha fundamentally but most all characters can be used at all levels of play, f2p totally valid.",Positive
"The storyline, character's, graphics and every thing is amazing! Tho.. I really wish they would add a chat feature where you can chat with friends. Afterall we all wanna interect with eachother too :D",Positive
"In 2 days, i can only login to the game once, other than that is always failed and make me returning to opening screen again and again before receiving messege said loading error Edit:Download it again, but it getting worse. I can login easily but the game glitching everywhere, especially, the floors and the walls",Negative
Nice game but i always lose 50/50 gatcha banner :((,Positive
the game is okay but it kind of annoyed me when we have to down everytime we open the game on the other day!!!,Positive
Please make an option to decrease equilibrium level. I can't play story quest and I can't beat new boss.,Negative
"Best mobile game experience I have had to date! This is a real treat in all aspects of the game, voice actors amazing, story pretty interesting, amazing combat and very far to f2p players. This is the gold standard for mobile games in my opinion.",Positive
Trying to update the game and it keep crashing while in mid update. I uninstalled and that didn't work.,Negative
"I've been trying to play this again since I've forgotten a lot about it, so I went to make a new account. After playing the tutorial, it got to the part where I select my character. I selected my character and gave them a valid name, but for the part where you have to hold a button, it didn't continue. I tried going to a different account, but I couldn't since I was stuck on the select screen. Also, there wasn't any audio except for the opening cut scene. Please fix these glitches, Hoyoverse.",Negative
"who did you hire to design these characters?? they're awesome! I love the characters, mostly March 7th. this game is one of the most f2p game Hoyoverse made so far, very detailed environment indeed. I'd never thought a turn based game would catch my eyes.",Positive
"Love this classic Turn-based RPG with magnificent storyline. But, sometimes I was too lazy to read npc convos especially on side-quests. Perfect game for me. I hope the devs will update the storyline. I cant wait to explore another world.",Positive
"Installed once on launch, got burnt out, and left the game. Came back for Boothill. Damn you, hot cowboy man.",Positive
The characters are interesting and fun to use in the turn based combat,Positive
One of the stories I've seen in a long time in a game and me personally. Cannot wait to see what the future holds for this game,Positive
Sorry you guys force a lvl 60 yanging fight while trying to protect Kafka when we only have access to lvl 50 power tier the boss fight is totally over powered between a no weakness yangqing and yanqing basically having 6 turns before you can react you placed the fight at the wrong tier it should be at lvl 60 this was a drastic mistake by the devs super unbalanced you need to think more carefully when creating boss fights,Positive
"Amazing story, great graphics. Would 100% recommend trying it out.",Positive
Game is Good. Good Rewards. Can be Addicting. Good luck on not spending money.,Positive
"good, but it won't render after the update, already tried to set it to highest graphic or reinstall it but it's still looks bad",Positive
"Amazing game, 10/10 graphics. I love it. I don't know how to describe it, but I love it.",Positive
"Too much talking! Do a fight, watch a scene, do a fight, watch a scene. This is just obnoxious!",Negative
Apparently they think doing updates in the middle of the day is smart ... devs are like the people who send trains through the middle of a city during rush hour.,Negative
A really good story aside from the xianzou and the devs are really rewarding ad well!,Positive
I find my experience amazing the story made me cry a lot of the times but my only complaint is why do we not have a room in the express ü•≤,Positive
at some point during battles it tends to freeze after which i have to close the app for it to work again,Positive
It takes a very long time for me to load and it's very annoying i never got to play the actual game,Negative
One of amazing Hoyoverse games ever!! Player since 1.0 and I'm so happy that i am playing this game for a year completely..,Positive
The 2.3 Arc is just amazing to me. I hope we get same quality for upcoming arc ‚úå,Positive
"I love the storyline, plus the turn based gameplay is really fun",Positive
"Peak game. Peak cinema. üëèüåπ * DONT ever do another ""Clockie: Dreamjoy Memoir"" event you need to bonk the one who came up with it üò≠üòÇ* *meanwhile legend of galactic baseballer best game*",Positive
New Boss is hard to kill players without good character setup will not able to continue to the story,Negative
Gameplay is good and the story is good but Averytime cutseen show up is always lagging,Negative
"It is one of the best role playing, story based and turn based game I have played. It has tooo good graphics. And the character skill animations are üòò too good. I recommend this game to you if you like role playing and story based open world game.",Positive
"This game has such good character plot and beautiful fight scenes, I also love the quality",Positive
the whole penacony story quest is almost an entire ff series in the early 20s. I'm satisfied 5*,Positive
"Can login with google account on smart phone,but can't on PC. WHY? If can't please do it equality in first time. Edit: Ok now I can login in pc,How ever I play with other account.",Positive
It's very cool but sometimes there's alot of bugs but it's very cool,Positive
"Love this game. Good story, funny at times. Love the characters",Positive
It would be nice if they added Co-op so we can farm better Relics and Ornaments.,Positive
"i love this game, i think it is best f2p game. One star down, only because my first 5 star was worst in the game, completely useless :)",Positive
Can't use Ult and Map button using a 8BitDo Controller but other buttons work fine.,Positive
Sunday got hit by ‚Äê--------train The story and game play is perfect. In my words,Positive
Can you make simple notebook ingame like to do list because there so much to catch up.,Positive

This game has amazing game play i put hundreds of hrs on it favorite character has to be huohuo she's my main healer keep up the good work,Positive
The best game I have ever played Edit: My problem already got fixed by just uninstalling and installing again,Positive
"Best game ever, generous and friendly to people who has less time everyday",Positive
So I would love to say the game is great but I have one thing is that oleg mouth doesn't move yet everyone else I seen so far mouth moves,Positive

Would recomnded but you have patience to get good 5 star charater but overall I enjoy story I've been playing for few months now.,Positive
Best story I've seen from a mobile rpg in a long time even better the Diablo immortals,Positive
Pathetic. Every account is rigged with some type of luck. My account has the worst luck where I have lost all the 50-50s so far. I have 5 limited banner characters and 9 standard characters (including eidolons).,Negative
"9/10, great story, VA, character design (omg ily acheron), gameplay and events.",Positive
"Great game, played for 150 hours and it's a great way to fill free time.",Positive
I like this game because this game has lot of adventure and more fun ending and sad ending,Positive
"Great game but I'm here because I lost my 50/50 to bailu. Not against the game play or anything. Just here for personal reasons. Give me my Aventurine next pull because I'm going insane. I need him bro i farmed for him for days and his banner is leaving tomorrow. I can't wait another rerun, just give me him üò≠üëä If I rate this 1 star, it has nothing to do with how good the game is. I'm experiencing grief if it happens. Give me my Aventurine /srs Update: Y'all suck",Negative
I have been playing ever since the first day it came out and its very fun and I like the graphics,Positive
"I like only three games in the world, genshin impact, honkai impact, and star rail. I think star rail is one of the best games in the world.",Positive
"This is way more relaxing than Genshin Impact, I love the story and how sarcastic the characters are",Positive
Game is generous with rewards and the game is not much complicated to understand.,Positive
"This game is so good! But sadly I have to devour my gallery to update it :,) I LOVE IT SM AND THE STORIES, THE CHARACTERS!‚ô•",Positive

This is the best game I ever played on a phone. Recommended if you're into games like Persona 5.,Positive
"Train forever flying, game forever loading. Can't even play,..",Negative
"as a honkai impact player, acheron back story brings back good old memories :)",Positive
"Installed for reward in another game, did not give and are trying to work their way out of it. SCAMMERS even beyond the manipulative gacha mechanics lol",Negative
I love this game but can you do something about the storage ? Like deleting past quests plss,Negative
I like the vibe and concept of this game.Diffrent from genshin...i likeee.The story and character design is god tier.Love them so much.,Positive
"1 star for Recall/Defend mechanics, nonstop loop and will waste your time.",Negative
"Want a game that false advertises f2p? Want a game that makes you suffer and force you to do things? Want an unfair battle? Come here. I'm trying to survive as a Honkai Impact, Genshin Impact, and Honaki Star Rail. The things in common between Genshin and Star Rail are whether you pay or lose. Honkai is the unfair and fair one, unlike some things.",Negative
I've kept Trying to Log in But it's always Faling an it's been Already an hour doing it,Negative
Beautiful game! I love the story and content and looks forward to all future updates,Positive
"The gacha pulls are a blessing. They're very generous with the amount of gems needed to pull for a character, which is already hard enough",Positive
"Some quet are so boaring I have to use Auto clicker and gone to watch some anime They wasted their time creating those usles question and Ours to better to give Puzzles then usles npc quest,,, üöï",Positive
The best gatcha game out there! This game has that MMO vibe where you gotta log in and do your dailys to keep up with everyone. Has a cool story too! Ngl i skip most of the dialogue but i was pretty invested in world 2s story and that final boss fight was epic asf. Is it pay to win? I would say yes for your first buy (you get double for your first pull) After yo 1st purchase i would say its not worth spending money. Better off just loggin every day and getting on dat grind. Use the PC version,Positive
"My phone is getting hot for all the downloading, downloading is slow and i dont have material for traces",Negative
"Pls provide skip button, ur story is not that enjoyable and provide not so worth it reward",Negative
"This game is so much fun and really gives a good challenge, especially against me.",Positive
Pretty good gacha game. Has actual endgame. Though it's still quite stingy with wishes,Positive
Excellent Need more optimization for low level device's though,Positive
Are you kidding me..! 19GB To download new version 2.2 .. just I already download all date and restart again.stupid this game Consumes too much GB internat,Negative
Can't really recommend an app that's broken at the account login process.,Negative

"This game is really cool, i love the art and the story very much.",Positive
Can't play the game due to log in error 1001_1 don't know what that means was working just fine until just now,Positive

"The game gacha, relic and relic upgrades trolls me so hard that makes me want to uninstall somehow.",Negative
"Pre-downloaded the resources for 2.3. The game sits at 35 GB rn, bro i can't. Please do something.",Positive
Honkai is the best gacha game. Why?? Because it has : 1. Awsome graphics 2. Awsome and touching story 3. Beautiful characters 4 Mommys... sorry... Mommys...yyyy..... 5.Daddy?..,Positive
Its not much heat right now on poco f3 :) but keepin on optimization hoyo for our satisfied for playin :) thanks once again :),Positive
"Great game, better suited for mobile than Genshin due to autobattle.",Positive
"I have played this game since it came out, and I love the characters and story. Def recommend this game!",Positive
"Honkai please give me my account back, I tried to get in my account with the right email but they keep saying account do not exist, I am very mad about this fact, I have forgotten my password but if keep saying account doesn't exist when I type in my gmail, I will try to be respectful as much as possible I started the game when it first come out and this happen to me when I throw away my time and storage for this, I am tried and disappointed",Negative
Love it just the best and I love the train when wishing and the fighting,Positive
One of the best games I've played ...... and we can expect this from hoyoverse...love it,Positive
The developers are lazy. There's no support for controller. Uninstalled,Negative
This is the most coolest game ever I recommended to everyone that like adventure games,Positive
I hate english localisation. I hate all the outdated memes and zoomer cringe dialogue,Negative
"Nice. The game is now good. It is a struggle to get stellar jade, but still good.",Positive
"Good game, but too much dialog.. sometimes makkes my mood break..",Positive
"I love the lore and characters! Its very smooth, too",Positive
It's a wonderful game with a good story and character designs,Positive
The Game is so Fun to play and still F2P Friendly. You should try this game. Size: ¬±18GB,Positive
"I cant login app by using mobile data, even connection is stable",Negative
I like it's details and I also like genshin impact so I tried honkai as well it so fun playing both haha,Positive
The story has gotten better with time and i think that's something to be proud of,Positive
"Better than Genshin on the rewards for f2p players, not the best but it's improved üëç",Positive
10/10 gameplay. 10/10 design char. Peak story.,Positive
I played genshin on day one and quit about 2 weeks later and it seems this game carried over the exact issues of why I quit genshin... I'm a mid size dolphin and love to spend but when the cost of one multi is $30 and I'll probably draw nothing... Won't be spending. Then the energy system... I literally can't progress any further till trail level 34 but I can't run any dungeons therefore I can't play the game till 20+ hours for it to refill. If I can't play this game I'm playing something else.,Negative
i lose boothill's 50/50 both character and light cone. so yeah goodbye hoyoverse...after 1year i give 5star.. now it's 1star.. goodbye.. and thank you for sweet memories and now worst memories.. i love HSR and now i hate it.. thank you again,Negative
"I love this game alot it so fun the details, graphics and everything is so cute and amazingly beautiful I have no other words on how to say this it's just so perfectly done with the voices and everything!!",Positive
Great game and if you use mistplay you can get paid to play it to 10/10 would recommend,Positive
"Hear me out im having a bug where my sky is glitching in belobog and absolutely crash texture at xianzhou luofu. god, my sky is green yellow and blue mixing together like pixelating and in belobog sometimes a glitch but disappear and appear randomly overall that my issue, please fix this bug and others too. its a great game any way",Positive
The game is great overall because how friendly it is to free to play players the animations are. Another thing the game looks amazing paired with its great story makes it memorable along with its cast of characters,Positive
"A lot of people want this game to be open-world, which I think is stupid considering how much it benefits from not being another genshin impact. And then there are the hardcore turn-based game fans who want this to be a game with an in-depth combat system that will take months to learn. Honestly, just enjoy the game and stop comparing it to others, I think it has enough of its own identity to merit that.",Positive
Takes so long to download data overall it is a great game please fix this,Negative
"It only says login error when I try to start it, help pls Edit: It perfectly works now, all I had to do was disable the DNS on my phone. As for the game itself, I love it so much.",Positive
"Very interesting story plot, character designs and turn based mechanics, however do wish to have 5 character in a team instead of 4 (just suggestions), overall I love this game! Keep it up!",Positive
So far for a turn based game its rewarding and really good gameplay wise the A.I will cheat alot though as they do in most turn based gotcha games spenders will breeze though. good story so far no complaints graphic wise it's definitely looking good but could be better on pc but it's very well optimized so far on mobile overall great but will see how the updates go expecially balance wise for low spending and free to play players,Positive
"After the update there is a login problem ,i tried everything... But nothing changed if anyone know the soulotions pls tell me",Positive
"Unoriginal, takes data, boring, and long story when you start up. Although your chances I noticed of gacha idk if it's just me of getting characters are high. But other then that, the maps and everything are so plain and boring and the characters cant jump or on camera mode do emotes like in genshin.",Negative
LOVE this game and the story. The characters are fun and each event gets better and better. However after preloading 1.6 content my game consistently crashes when I try to start it.,Positive
"Great anime like experience and a great turn base RPG. Even the F2P is good since to provides you with lots of pulls and resources in order to begin your journey. Also, the music is amazing!",Positive
"I enjoyed for a couple months or so, then for some reason the game started to drag, the drop rates are insanely low, it's just not fun the game is simply not rewarding enough. My advice is look somewhere else. Uninstalled.",Negative
"HATE IT! when I played it the whole entire game was loading and after loading it randomly restarted the game and I couldn't do anything! And you need to work on your games because what is this and using npc to say ""download the game NOW"" LIKE COME ON NOW.. WORK ON YOUR GAME OF STARTING IT AND DONT BE SUCH A LAZY PERSON THAT MAKES THE SAME GAME. and honkai please work on this app more better because it will have more downloads if you wouldn't load your game so slow.",Negative
"This game is peak mobile gacha gaming experience, no one comes close. I hope the production and development team keep making it and stay safe and healthy",Positive
Best animated moves &scene Best story best graphics best awards to proceed as a free to play all over worth to play game,Positive
"Stunning & immersive worlds with a great storyline and quality voice acting! The battle system is slick and challenging. There is so much beautiful & artistic content in this game, it deserves all its accolades and more!!!",Positive
"Amazing turned based game very free to play friendly gives a ton of rewards for new and old players with amazing endgame modes and splendid developers and player communication. The story is also quite good but nothing groundbreaking it is a mix of fun, excitement and comedy. The developer are really passionate about this game and it shows.",Positive
"I beat the game 7 days ago, I already did the v1.1 post game, this game surprised me, I haven't enjoyed such a detailed and deep plot and story for a long time, listening to certain OSTs of this game gives me goosebumps spine just remembering the first part of the ending of the story mode... Enjoy, the best this game has to offer is the story and the memes, read everything from the main quest and good game for you",Positive
"It's god awful, just like every other gacha game. But man do I love it, I've been playing it for a couple days now, a bit too much, and the grind can get a bit annoying, however I am all for it, the more time I can play the better, even if it is just a bunch of the same fighting over and over. I also don't mean to brag, but I'm lucky and uh.. I enjoy annoying my friends by bragging about what I have and they don't, and I haven't even spent a damn dime on this game.",Positive
"I have had surprisingly no bugs and issues, like the other guys(perhaps due to superior hardware, hehe). The tutorial is really boring, and full of big words, that you'll just skim over. It's better to watch a yt video to summarise the lore than to do it yourself. Then we come to the first playable planet. It's good gaming experience. Then the second planet, it's China, eww. They use big words, making it hard to understand anything, hate it. The characters are pretty good, the variety is fun.",Positive
"Overalls this is a good game , good story and good quality, and graphics. It kicks me out of the game whenever im at a location with a bad internet , so to inform the user of having trouble logging in, then just check your wifi because this game asks a lot",Positive
"It just wouldn't work on my phone (samsung galaxy s22) it was laggy and the sound was stuttered, as someone with autism that was really annoying! Had to uninstall, I will try re-downloading it in the future see if it improves.",Negative
"FF quality turn based, legitimately feels like you are playing a top tier rpg, with fun combat, great music, and absolutely spectacular over the top skill animations. Don't let the fact that this is a gacha stop you from playing this amazing game. I mostly play this on PC, but sometimes I'll log on mobile while I watch tv.",Positive
I love everything about this game if only they add multiplayer that would be fun,Positive
The story isn't interesting neither are characters its your cliche MC has no memories and the gameplay is very mid at best you can auto it battles are easy. I really don't like you can't skip the story feels forced to read it there's need to be skip button not everyone likes reading it. Gacha system is similar to Genshin which is annoying drop rates is awful.,Negative
"Pretty bummed, New Samsung Galaxy S22 got hot in less than 5 minutes. üò≠ I was really looking forward to playing this game, but even with the adjustments in the settings, it didn't help. Also, if you don't care for turn-based games, then you won't like this game.",Negative
"I'm not biased or anything but THIS GAME IS GOOD, The pity system is better than any gacha game that I have ever played, The game is generous in giving rewards, It has good character designs, good story writing, The only thing that I want to improve in this game is herta's simulation some of the worlds are not beginner friendly like world 3, also the rewards in hertas simulation are not bad but not good.",Positive
"I wish I could give this 0 stars honestly. This game has a 50% chance of just not loading anything when you hit play, and the few times it does work and ALLOWS you to download the rest of the resources, it will just glitch out and stop the download indefinitely. I've deleted the game, reinstalled it, and restarted the game several times and it just NEVER works. A waste of your time if you ask me.",Negative
"It should ve been 5 star but tbh from the last update, the simulated universe is pretty disappointing and frustating, i mean what's the point on having path resonance when the blessings never appear after beating enemy, im using nihility path and i can fight like 6 enemies + refresh and never get nihility blessing. So 5 star is not for this game, for now.",Negative
enjoyable game play. i like it when it was come to combat cause you just need to chill out and think of the strategy. please do more updates on main story cause i was the one type of players that enjoy reading. oh and if you wanna do event story Don't do to tight with lore. just let the imagination of the writer go.,Positive
Ever since the 1.1 update the game has a lot of bugs and glitches more lags and specially when I try to click the pull banner automatically forced closed Unlike the previous update even though laggy at first.. no bugs and glitches I hope you could fix this and more optimized in low end phones,Negative
The game is fun and everything the only thing is lacking is the story itself. It's somewhat slow and not like other games I've played (like genshin impact) but I really love the style just probably make the storyline faster and more of a understanding story.,Positive
Dude its an amazing game but taking up over 20 gigs on my phone is not diabolical to you guys??? Its like you want my fingertips burned clean off the way this game overheats my phone. Its such a good game tho im currently going through boothill withdrawals bc I had to delete it due to how much space it takes. (Unfortunately I have other uses for my phone besides star rail.),Negative
"It's very casual, yet also, for the more hardcore players, a challenging game. Fun events, an amazing storyline, great characters, and it's very F2P friendly. I've got nothing but praise for this game. Keep it up, Hoyoverse! üôåüèª PS: Thank you for the free Dr. Ratio <3",Positive
"This game is absolutely amazing and stunning! It brings to a whole new world with the animation, characters and amazingly beautiful music!! I can't wait to experience more of the content it has to offer. I 100% recommend!",Positive
"It good game, every character have unique abilities and you can create your own team with you preference. It good turnbase for newbies player turn base, but still challenging for veterans turnbase player.",Positive
"The animation, the characters, the story, voicelines and the exploration is so amazing! I don't usually like turn based games but hsr really changed my mind <3 I love the teams that worked in hoyoverse for this, overall amazing game 10/10",Positive
"This game is amazing. It has been a long time since i have enjoyed and been hooked up on a RPG game of this sort. Story plot, little touches, polishes. Outstanding experience!",Positive
"having bugs and control over my phone Bluetooth connection. Was wearing hands free earbuds to play the games. The BT connection auto disconnect and connect back when I play this game. Does it even having access to my personal info that might leak my private info? ü•≤ Tested with every single app on my phone, the connection only have problem when I tab into this game üòû idk why.",Negative
"Compared to genshon impact it has a lot more better story, especially regarding characters. I love strategic combat system, glad they tried it. I would definitely recomend this game to everyone to at least try it. üòÅ",Positive
A very fun game! alot of good Rewards and good stories!,Positive
"While it is kinda lacking on the skill menu and item consumption in the battle phase, it is still good for a turn based game with the semi open world mechanic. Waiting for Blade to come because he is husbandoable :3",Positive
"Great game, it's fun although it starts out a bit slow. But once you figure out your team things start to pick up. The only thing it's missing for a five star review is controller support.",Positive
"Love the game overall. Though turn based combat isn't my favorite. Dropped it a while ago, but to those that enjoy turn based stuff, this game is actually great and tons of fun.",Positive
"its really good, love the story line, great graphics, cant wait till the release the rest if it, but i will say its hard to level up bc the side missions dont came as quick as they would in genshin impact, so maybe in the next update there would be a better way to get side missions",Positive
"Love the game and I'm more impressed than what I saw when it was first announced, great job! I just have one issue with it, and it's the fact I cannot play on mobile data (error code 1001_1) and would really like if this could be solved in a future update",Positive
"This game totally deserves 5 star rating, but the reason I only gave 2 stars is because when you do summons you have only a 5% chance of actually getting a character. The rest of the time it is light cones. If you had better chance to summon characters this game would be the best of its kind. It has great story and character background.",Negative
This game lacks support to joystick/gamepads. I've downloaded it on my phone but I just can't seem to enjoy using touch controls. That's the only thing I criticize about this game. The rest is very enjoyable.,Positive
It's a good game but please try to reduce the capacity for storage I bought a whole SD card with 128 GB and yet even when I put hsr it took up my phones storage and kept saying there wasn't storage left? All I ask is please try to reduce the amount of storage it takes up.,Negative
I love this game but lately it crash or stop (become black) when i m playing and i had to restart back the game. And theres a money issue: I spend more money than usual in this game expenses and couldn't get Event character. Fix it and I will give Five Star. Thanks,Negative
"I don't like turn based. Star Rail still somehow makes this enjoyable, AND has a good auto-battle for those that want it. As for gameplay and character development, AAA tier. (Serval has one of the most real to life representations of grief and escapism I've seen in games--amazing). Wonderful storytelling on top of endless Easter eggs of comedy. And as someone who's played the masterpiece of a story that was Honkai Impact 3rd, I'm a bit biased but I expect this story to get deeper still.",Positive
"Finally a great turnbased without the needs of stamina (yeah, we could farm materials through monsters encounter like old PS1/PS2 era unlike othet mobile game right now). Happy that it has the same pity system like Genshin. Hopefully all characters get fair share of love from developer (every unit could be a great unit, just the investment and team comps may differ).",Positive
"I am a old player of these companies games (like Genshin). The game is fun with the new characters and storyline. The autofarm mechanic also helps lessen the amount of time I have to spent on repetitive gameplay. Overall a pretty solid and satisfying experience. However, gameplay does get annoying sometimes. Especially since this is a gacha game. You could grind to get gems but microtransaction is the easy path here. In addition, the game eventually gets boring with the grind. (Genshin Grind)",Positive
"The gameplay is addictive and extremely clever, and the monetization knows how to take a back seat to the gameplay experience. A real success story. Honkai: Star Rail is a stylish and engaging turn-based RPG that marries a quirky sci-fi tale with anime-style graphics it's very free to play friendly too!",Positive
"Gameplay, effects, graphics, sound, music, especially for the storyline are all very good and interesting. Keep developing. I love it.",Positive
Just a cash grab. Not worth and it's only decent if you are okay using common characters. The story is mid but the only thing I can give the game credit for are the animations. They are crisp but it doesn't matter if you can't pull any of the characters.,Negative
Excellent gacha RPG. Good balance between the stamina system and content that can be played continuously. Fantastic character models and animations. Meticulous attention to detail.,Positive
The game itself is fine but at the same time it's too big for my phone. I was sure I could transfer the game data to an SD card to save space and whatnot but not even that is possible. Then with the announcement of it coming to ps4 I was excited but again I guess not. Won't be playing much longer sadly.,Negative
"Hey! Zenless supports Type C gamepad! Come on dev, you can do it too, right?",Negative
"So far, they haven't disappointed me as a new player, and the game gives. which, in turn, enticed me to spend to support the devs. If this game ever starts pulling off P2W focus, then I'm changing my review.",Positive
Some of the dumbest ads I've ever seen.,Negative
"Need better skin tone diversity in all hyv games, won't remove bad review until granted",Negative
Worth to play if u like turn based game.,Positive
I love this game but I won't change my 1 star until the whitewashing issue is addressed,Negative
Great game and not wasting much time of your real life üëç,Positive
"great game, easy to play. Gak kikir üòã",Positive
"I've been playing since release and honestly I should've done this earlier. Please address the blatant colourism in your games. For Penacony to have taken inspiration from the Jazz age which was pioneered by black people you refuse to release any characters that aren't white. Aventurine being inspired by Romani yet you whitewashed him. Arlan being the only ""dark"" character and having racist names for his skill and ultimate. Address and fix this, otherwise many will stop paying, including me.",Negative
Worst game ever each update they have long chat and no skip option waste of time,Negative
Love it so far love the Jrpg feel it has going for it it reminds me of my childhood games the characters are so likeable unlike genshin lol and at first I wasn't that impressed but after that boss at the end of the tutorial I was like ok I like this a lot having a blast with it I'm sure it won't take long before the daily grind comes up but till then I'm enjoying it a lot.,Positive
"The game is amazing.Good graphics,amazing voice acting,great gameplay and the design of the characters is just beautiful.I come to like this game more because the missions doesn't take long to finish they are just right.",Positive
"Best game but lag little bit, but I still enjoying this game ‚ò∫Ô∏è",Positive
5 STARSüôèüôèüôè I LOVE THIS GAME I SPEND REAL LIFE MONEY ON IT AND I PLAY IT EVERY DAYü•∞üôè,Positive
"Add a game permanent game mode where you can customize/change skills, talents ultimates, etc. of a selected character with other characters kits. This is just my recommendation because I think it's gonna be fun.",Positive
Not interested in whatever romance TB has with Firefly.,Negative
Great game so far but irritated I can only run it at 60 FPS on my Galaxy S23 while IOS gets 120FPS. Will update review once we get 120 as well.,Negative
It is the best game i ever if you want see big numbers like genshin impact and zenless zero this isyour best game,Positive
"Boring gameplay. Things get little interesting with Aventurine but soon die down. The falling bs with 2 siblings is cringe af cuz it reassembles HI3. Almost every ending has this (Hi3). This game makes me think it's a spin-off of HI. As soon as Acheron said she was Raiden Mei, I deleted the game. Just, I get you want to attract HI kanchou but pls, I have enough. Instead of making it interesting, u only show ur lack of creativity. Utterly disappointed as dayone kanchou/trailblazer",Negative
"I can't stop playing this, I need help!",Positive
"I changed it to 2 stars because the gameplay isn't bad BUT logging in to the game is annoying it keeps on saying ""login error please try again"" please fix this .ever sence Saturday the game keeps on crashing and not letting me play it just shows a black screen and takes me back to my home screen.",Negative
Great game over all. I just have a slight issue where in SU everytime i use the Path of Propagation resonance power my game starts to lag and hang. Only after its over does it go back to running smoothly everywhere else,Positive
This is best honkai star rail ever but genshin will never,Positive
I Really love march in the game its the best also really fun,Positive
"Very good rpg turn based game i've played so far! As a fan of pokemon games (which is turn based obviously) and card games, this game is really enjoyable and offers other ways to enjoy a turnbased game! I also like the very good graphics and animations! Herta go brrrrr, give me that diamond! XD",Positive
"Thanks for the good experience, this game is very chiil and fun",Positive
This game is amazing and plus I love RPG games,Positive
"graphics good characters are good that's a while over all the games, so good in the story",Positive
"I tried the game again after a year, I have 3 accounts, I did 3 multis on each one on the starter pull, I got the exact same pull on all of them, they just switch position from 1 to 3, like litterally the same cards, the same 2 copies of March, and the 1 copy of the other girl you get after the tutorial. Genshin is god awfull at pulling character, but this is just disgusting and insulting.",Negative
"Didn't even play, the registration for this game (on mobile at least) is nearly impossible to do. Then, after about 20 minutes of dealing with the bs verification, it froze on the loading screen for another 20 minutes. So, I had to update AND login again when I reopened the app. Let's just say I will not be re-downloading this.. only got it for Mistplay points anyway ü§£ & My response to the devs, maybe just fix it instead of trying to make me do more work ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm not changing my review clown",Negative
the new patch is too much is so very large.... quit uninstall....,Negative
One of THE best turn based games every character is unique and very good rewards and events 100% recommend,Positive
Got an ad for this on youtube so I uninstalled. I will never play a game I see an ad for since it's intrusive to what I want to see.,Negative
Great game if you sure that you won't be quitting for some time. If you quit and get back after a few months there is already too much stuff left and it's hard to adaptate :/,Negative
"The game is my favourite now. Great story, favorite characters from honkai impact. Graphic is very cool. I can't even believe that the game was created by mihoyo. This is a different level, unlike genshin and honkai impact. I don't want to say that these games are bad, because I still love honkai impact very much. I just didn't expect mihoyo to do that. But gacha system will be pretty terrible after honeymoon i guess. That gacha is not good with that type of game.",Positive
"Game now runs fairly well on a flagship from 2019 (used to have seizures). Played quite a bit, got extremely unlucky with draws as usual lol. Overall a pretty good but just like the rest of mihoyo games, gets really boring really fast for me personally. If you like genshin or honkai impact, you probably should try this game too.",Negative
I love this game but whenever I try to put my graphics higher the place gets laggier and the background just goes white üò≠ (I play on mobile btw) I expect better on PC (haven't downloaded it there yet) but either way its still pretty good. I expect even more good things to come out of this game.,Positive
So far the game has been pretty good I'm glad I pre-register to the game sure for some reason the icon for the basic attack goes blank whenever I'm on the space station map but other then that pretty awesome game can't wait to see how more of the story unfolds,Positive
"It seemed kind of like a real game. I was even able to get my controller working with it. However, the UI was so miniscule, I was starting to get a migraine trying to read it.",Negative
"Game looks great but I'm concerned about the security risk, my security system on my phone tells me your app can open my camera app and start taking pictures without permission, plus it can access your device information so you can get a profile on everyone, so unless this is fixed I won't be able to play this which sucks.",Negative
"Bad , less than 20 gig installation. Sorry , if your phone has less storage . You cannot play this.",Negative
I can't open the game it just shows error. And i can't use internet because i use wifi. Its been fixed. now i can open the game but the whole world is glitching. I can't see half of the world. I know it will be fixed but please make it more smooth and bug free from mobile. I am using a 6 gb phone,Negative
"Great and fun, but while playing ang on a duel there's a bug that it automatically close the game and back to menu of my phone and I need to re open it so I could play it again but it close again, so I hope you could help me.",Positive
"Tha character is good and its a great game for free 2 Play. Not a pay to win game as we all expected for hoyoverse. The characters design and detailed are explendid as expected again for hoyoverse. The story is awesome and I am inlove with Himeko, Gepard and Jin Yuan at the moment. I hope it can be play as coop so I can help to level up my friends. Please make it a coop game MIHOYO.",Positive
Best gacha game I ever played normally i hate gacha game but I love this one keep up the good work!!! (And cool character would be nice :D),Positive
Just wanna say I got SAM and Ruan mei in less than 40 pulls.,Positive
"Nice game and storyline, although I didn't spend any money on it, it's still playable and quite fair too. But I encountered one issue, recently this update making my loading screen become green. Is there any way to solve it? Edit:Noice, it's has been fixed, thanks!",Positive
"Waaaaaalls of meaningless text. Only few characters can make through simulated universe normal and swarm, so don't even bother picking characters you like to the team. Rewards are poor (but there are plenty of them - that's a plus), quests are ridiculous - even humour in this game is forced, characters are usually mean to MC for no reason. Grind is strong in this game - u have to be much above the enemies to even compare to fight and within proper cycles. Gacha, p2w(or f2p if you like strugglin)",Negative
"It's fun and easy to play, the character designs are AWESOME, and the storyline so far is great. It's easy to understand the gameplay early on, so that's not a struggle. On the whole, it's a great game and I highly recommend",Positive
Love this game and the turn based fighting styles are kinda nice actually cause it has auto fight function and yea I can literally farm materials while eating and even studying....Hshshs pretty useful if you ask me and love the characters design. Can't wait for moree nice characters ‚ô°,Positive
"A good game. Fair rewards, nice events. Can play whenever I want without the fear of missing out. Probably would buy passes to support developers, but I don't have money. Anyways spending isn't really necessary.",Positive
Really good game. I maxed my 5* (SW E6 LC 5) in June and glade of it. The story is good the gameplay too and all. I got bored of the team composition of the game tho. 85% of the char are support so the team are always the same 2 or 3 composition; Full Quantum or SW and 3 others. I'll play again when the game will have more character to it :/ Free DR Ratio is cool tho. Pretty good char :p,Negative
"This game gets sooo boring so fast.. just like genshin impact, thete is no skip option on dialogues, which they take 80% of the time of the game Its hostile to new players because they want more action and less waiting for (most of the time) 20 minutes for just the dialogue to finish and then run around for another 20 minutes until a fight sequel progresses Many players already request skip option on dialogues on genshin and its a main reason people abandon these games, and you decided not to",Negative
Whenever I open the game all i get is the login error seriously it's infuriating.,Negative
"everytime i log in on my other account (i have 2) it always ""too many request, try again later"" even if it's first time logging in. It's annoying also not just that. sometimes when i log out my other account and try my other one i can't log in it's stuck at log in screen. I tried to reinstall the app to give it a try but i haven't even logging yet ""too many request try again later"" was the one who welcome me. Such a waste of timeüò°",Negative
game is cool n all but I wish hyv give more representations.. like come on I'm sick of seeing white skins man it's getting boring af like add some melanin bro,Negative
"mihoyo cant really make a good product. 9 years of experience in the industry just to make the most banal game ever. the meat of the game is going back and forth people, what an experience. if the TB combat is good thatd be fine but it isnt. even Lord of Heroes is better and more engaging than this turd. i hope kurogames copies this next so we get an actual good turn based game",Negative
"Most of the one star reviews are either from people who can't download the game, or people who have pre-downloaded it and are mad it wasn't available to play until 4/26. The game is good. Turn based combat is fun, and they balance it well. All my friends and I had no issues with downloading or playing it. I think most of the negative reviews are from those who aren't the brightest.",Positive
This game is amazing but the only problem is if I have a slow internet it just always show error 1001.3 but when I play genshin it just work fine even with a slow internet I hope that this will be fix they should remove the error warning and just put the loading screen like genshin instead of the game quitting itself,Negative
"Absolutely amazing game, with great storytelling, engaging characters and captivating gameplay with generous rewards. Thank you to the Honkai: Star Rail team for providing such a great gaming experience.",Positive
"Breathtaking, seeing that the game already hit 1st in the leader board that one day I knew it was worth checking out. Love the game play and open-world experience! Very fun quests and would recommend to anyone who enjoys any of Hoyoverses other games.",Positive
"after my severe genshin burn out this was JUST what i needed üí™ 2 years of genshin get's you stressed out real bad but i think that if you're looking for a similar RPG experience and just wanna lay back relax and not stress out over farming for primos and still do yummy gacha pulls, then this has got to be ur choice. didn't give it a 5 star tho cuz it crashes sometimes (like just now so im waiting for it to download again while writing this), but overall super fun and awesome",Positive
Unlimited chat dialogues. Reduce that and minus all these chat talks and where you can walk only at some points that's only slowly. Man I play this game right when I'm about to get sleepy . Get fast dialogues available where we can view them if we wanted later like a series watch thing later. I'm about to play not to watch stories that's unlimited goes on an on without a break,Negative
"Even though the issue I've mentioned previously has been fixed, the game itself is still... well, a glitchy mess. Textures not loading, game crashing, etc.",Negative
"The game offers you high quality gameplay and good graphics, as well as good stories, albeit if you already progress far enough, the game become monotonous and boring. But so far it offers various updates that fills the gap here and there, and bit by bit story updates is able to help player to have a sense of progression",Positive
"Amazing storyline, funny dialogues and character interactions, and it doesn't get boring despite me reaching endgame weeks ago. These are some of the qualities I love to find in a game. Let's add an amazing OST and I'm all for it, 5 stars deserved",Positive
No app support for backbone controllers on android but iPhone works fine legit cannot play the game now. Will uninstall,Negative
"This game became bad at v1.1 because it became really, I mean, REALLY laggy. It's fairly laggy at a few seconds, but after that its just pure lag hell. The game quality is at very high even though I set it to very low. So until the devs fix this stupid lag, I'm gonna leave it at 1 star for now.",Negative
"It's a mihoyo game Cons: Needs patience and a lot of grinding (you gonna burn out no matter what so expect that to happen sooner or later) Pros: immersive world, art design and f2p friendly (kinda) But i really want to point out combat system in this game is just top notch I really like this game but i don't like that they didn't launch it on psn on official launch release like they promised Could've saved my poor potato device..",Positive
"I love this game but the new boss is too op in the 1.6 event don't you think? Not many players can bypass it. Please nerf the boss and lessen it's health, not all players can do the event because of the boss and it's too overpowered to defeat many players are struggling it. So please next time don't make the bosses to overpowered on events.",Negative
"Didn't encounter any bugs, I like the concept of the game, it's actually smoother than genshin, visuals are great, the sound design is great, voice acting is the same with genshin, the gacha is... still gacha and the story is pretty interesting. This is my review for now...",Positive
"Good story, good animation, actually funny dialogue at times and f2p friendly (I have got 3 limited 5 stars and 4 standard 5 stars in a little over a month and a half, for reference, at almost maximum pity of 70 or more for half of the characters )",Positive
"I love this game, the story is phenomenal and props on how generous and casual friendly it is! The characters are undoubtedly the best part, all are written with so much depths and multidimensional. Overall, I really recommend trying out Honkai: Star Rail!",Positive
"Not a big fan of turn base rpg, but this one has to be one of the smoothest combat system really engaging and doesn't get boring with the time the amount of tickets and rewards are really generous so far the game has been so much fun",Positive
I love how this game doesn't take itself too seriously. Its nice that the rewards are also quite generous but not the the point it feels unfulfilling considering how they still make us do fair amount of work for them. The story is amazing and the characters are well-written.,Positive
"I love everything about this game, the characters, the story, the dialogues, and the lovable MC. I'm invested on its future endeavors and adventures, unfolding the lores while enjoying new gameplays, I hope it won't get repetitive though.",Positive
"Great game. Turn based gameplay is very mobile friendly and graphics are nicely optimized, side quests are fun and rewarding. Gacha is a bit unsatisfying but does not affect the core gameplay.",Positive
"I thought this game would not be as fun as genshin, but I was wrong, this game is really fun! this game offers something new that is not in Genshin. Absolutely beautiful! the music, graphics, character design, love it!!",Positive
"Changed opinion. From 5 to 2. Game is perfectly designed (graphics, music etc) BUT it's absolutely empty. Got exploration lvl 50 and bought some in-game stuff. Now I see that there is nothing to achieve. Literally you will just spend from 5 to 10 mins a day in this game after a week of gameplay. Nothing to explore and no resources (fuel) to farm anything. Hoping that devs will expand game.",Negative
"A great continuation to the Honkai series. Unlike the three prior Honkai games which focused on 2D shoot-em-ups or the 3D action hack and slash games, this one is more on the relaxed pace with the turn based RPG. It also expands upon the lore and cosmolgy of the Honkai series and the Honkaiverse as a whole",Positive
Absolutely love this game is adventurous the story lines are amazing. Only thing is I have completed all the missions and waiting for some more to come up I do the daily puzzles ect.. but then that's it when will there be knew storyline and missions please,Positive
"Good game, but the menu lags most of the time and I can barely play anymore because the loading always just says ""checking data updates"" and it always times out with error code 200.... Is there a fix since I basically cannot play the game..",Negative
"I like the game. but recently it was having an error. I had to open it 1-2 times. And now it's not opening. I already tried to clear cache and force stop or whatever, but still, it doesn't open.",Negative
"Ive had so much fun with this game and while i debated on giving it 5 stars i have yet to give a game 5 stars as i see 3 stars as average and while yes it has predetory microtransactions there are more ways than ever before to earn currency then older hoyo games and i have yet to experience any game breaking bugs unlike some $70 games there are small things that bug me, interaction areas can be very picky, running from a fight puts you at your last anchor not your closest activated, etc",Positive
"The lag is driving me insane!! No offense but my head hurts so much! I play on mobile and I'll link genshin on this, Genshin has like plus 20GB and works very nicely(I uninstalled it for the meantime for storage) but when I played HSR that has lesser GB it lags insanely! even though they are in the maximum, lowest, I mean the very Lowest! in graphics. I cannot play properly anymore, always. Even the simplest walk and Loading screen has lag. I hope ya'll fix it somehow hoyo! I love your games :'<",Negative
"I'll rate it 2 stars for now. There's so.mamy things to improve in this game. First and should be prioritized is the Optimization. The game's optimization worst than Genshin and way worst compared to Honkai impact. FPS drops, Audio Crackles are also major issues in this game. And Being unable to Customized and toggle the team before fighting in the Story is really Annoying.",Negative
"I love this game, it's literally my favourite one, the story, the character's and overall everything is just fantastic, I still have a tad bit of trouble but it's great overall :).",Positive
"one of the best hoyoverse games I have ever seen, have seen some videos about the gameplay and it's just PERFECTION.üëå the crossover between honkai impact 3rd and genshin impact is the best idea for a third game, but people don't understand that this is just a pre-release and the official is still on April 26th. But I believe that this game will be a big success, the character designs, story, and everything else is too good to be true lol. please continue to further improve the gameüëç",Positive
Engaging gameplay with the best story and characters.,Positive
"Its very nice especcially the cute charachters, but its hard getting New charrachters so keep them coming!!",Positive
"The game is overall fun to play, the major issue is the loading screen-- I cannot play the game because whenever i start playing it either crashes or give me the error login message, please fix this i haven't played the game for a week now ‚òπÔ∏è Edit: hehe, i switched on PC",Positive
"This game is great! Love the art, music, and charector designs. Yhis game improves every update. Would recommend to anyone l, the story is great . It has AMAZING Combat . All and all a good game. Hope it gets even better.",Positive
"Game still seems a bit poor in optimization for phones, using galaxy S22ult. Other than that only complaint I have is the same as with genshin, it's the pull system. Great characters, interesting story.",Positive
"Games awesome but sometimes i freeze and also not see the Characters, and talent icons. And also i get kicked out of the app sometimes and when i talk to a character(Jing Yuan) they sometimes turn black while their body goes away.",Positive
"I like this game so much, But there's a bug when I'm login, after I press ""Start"" the loading bar didn't show up, and it made me waiting 30 mins and still not showing up. My connection are fine cuz I play genshin without a problem. pls fix this asap.. I will return the 5 star",Positive
"Definitely a game where it's based on opinion. It's turn based strategy is very good and very good animation also. The gacha is also very nice compared to other games. If you're looking for a game like genshin impact,This is it. although I wouldn't say this is anywhere near a genshin level game but definitely try it",Positive
It's finally fixed however acheron's burst consistently crash everything I use it please fix this issue honkaiüò≠,Negative
Wonderful game hook is my baby girl,Positive
"Was excited for this reaching the ps5 decided to play on the phone to prepare and get some characters only to find out after it came out that it made a separate account using the same email and can't log out of the ps5 without messing up my genshin account. Been fighting with their ""support team"" only for them to tell me that's its my loss and that there is nothing they can do not even a refund.",Negative
"I would give it five stars, but the game is so short. I was expecting to travel to more worlds, fight diffrent crearures and explore to my hearts content. The main story cuts off short leaving you wanting more. I am so utterly bummed about it.",Negative
"Enjoyed the game so much who would've thought turn based gameplay is still relevant. now with ""auto-battle"", you could focus on the story and can do different things irl. hopefully the dev team(or whoever manages the game) here wont be as stingy on events as genshin had.",Positive
"Really good game overall, tons of back story, one of my favorites being a drama they put out when finding trash cans you can interact with weirdly enough. Ignore gurt's message, there isn't any ads so he's probably a bot, it's disgusting. Regardless, I may keep constantly playing this game",Positive
What a good game and it cost so much gb but it's worth it and it have so many characters that are designed and events it's so much and the story it's sometimes funny the trailblazer/mc makes it a bit more funny and u can fight monsters or robot whatever...,Positive
"It's probably one of the best gacha games out there. It's very convenient for just casual play, unlike genshin impact, where you have to play continuously to make some sort of progress.",Positive
"Amazing game that allows you to quickly level up characters and provides copious amounts of fuel to farm for them. I really hope the gacha system stays as affordable as it is (unlike one of its counterparts,HI3). F2P isn't easy, but it is doable. I love the aspect of being able to auto-fight, which enriches the lore experience. Characters are relateable. ""Texting"" mechanic is realistic to modern-day trends. My only disappointment is the lack of racial diversity and co-op interaction.",Positive
Game is good and been playing since the release. One thing i like to be fixed is the audio. It seems the sound of the game is worse than genshin like it's compressed and in mono. I hope this problem will be fixed,Positive
"This game is absolutely gorgeous and best gameplay features, well depends how lucky players get meta character they want but by using turtle team it's still good game and build best set for characters. This game is amazing even still update Version 1.0, I recommended this game for everyone who likes anime, semi-openworld, turn-base and etc what everyone like about this game.",Positive
Game often stop downloading and asks for reboot. Forced tutorial. Unshippable dialogs. Slow travel. Boring quests. Quest require input from a player which is not necessary. A lot of functions locked until part of story is progressed. Also nonexistent rewards. Overall a terrible game. Uninstalled after losing to the tutorial boss.,Negative
"This game is definitely one of the best mobile games, the gameplay is pretty good, the story is very well developed, the characters are very interesting,There are several other reasons that make this game so good. Anyways, I recommend 10/10.",Positive
My only peeves are battery heating up and why no equipment or weapons in basic treasure chests? Why can't you add basic weapons into them? Also games a bit too complex for mobile and this game feels more action liveplay than turn based its too cartooney in places imo this is a console/pc game not a mobile one alot of stuff in it and most ppl don't own top of range phones which games like this need my s9 overheated in 15 minutes about game needs controller added if its not already. Not bad tho,Negative
Update 1.1 is disaster. On previous version i still can play the game with my Infinix Hot 9 Play although i must restart the game 3 times to be able to play. But now it keep sending 1003 error message or something and keep blocking me to enter the game.,Negative
"Absolutely amazing game, turn based fans rejoice! Beautiful graphics, fun and immersive story with funny little easter eggs too, and a nice skill system. Please don't expect a Genshin copy, this is not Genshin but a unique game of it's own. Highly recommend!",Positive
"definitely my favorite turn based game, with a good quality of story, character, exploration, and animations on some details. <3",Positive
"The game is amazing when I first downloaded it, but now I've been having trouble with constant lagging and often half of the train is missing, the walls, the floor are Missing, and just randomly out.",Negative
It's an amazing game. My only problem is the Belobog festival quest. Topaz's chubby robot guard was so hard despite bringing the right combat types/weaknesses. But it's still fun and the rewards are incredibly generous.,Positive
"This game looks like realsitic! I love those characters and storylines there since I installed there, After 10 days when I installed it, I'm strong already and grind some more gems to get my favorite 300 Draw Character and make me some luck. I'll prefer the game and looks like realistic and I wish, I want to update more storylines there.",Positive
"Genshin is way better... Honkai Impact too. The graphics are pretty, the story is good but the battle system, is not reay fun to play for me. Not being able to dodge and stuff like that, not for me. And also, the character (especially females) are sexualised a lot, but that's a problem in video games in general ig. Woman are not just a pair of booba. Not every woman are skinny asf. Get some diversity...",Negative
"So, first impression, amazing turn based action rpg games, with stylized visual. Gacha as expected the same as genshin. But I still think this game need more optimization. It still a high demanding app, which is cost you a good device to run smoothly. Overall, good exp gaming. 4 star for no free 5 star character.",Positive
"I really love this game, but the devs recent behavior is not acceptable and there are no excuses",Negative
"This game is absolutely astounding. From the visuals to gameplay itself, I can actually ignore the turn based aspect and enjoy it all.",Positive
"So I play both Genshin and HSR on an Android phone. I play Genshin on 45-60/Low-Med Res, and HSR on 60fps/LowRes. And for some reason, Genshin, which is bigger than HSR, runs smoother, despite the fact that HSR is almost 3 times smaller than Genshin. Aside from that, Love the story so far, Caelus/Stelle better than Aether/Lumine both in relevance and gameplay, very interesting characters and questlines. Looking forward to more improvements and optimization",Positive
"Update to my original review: I was able to fix the problem I had with the in-game update, which makes me estatic! 10/10 game, absolutely recommend playing as long as you have the storage for it!",Positive
"If you can get past the gacha, this is genuinely the best mobile game. I don't like playing action games on mobile, but this is a turn-based game. The graphics are good, the story is good, the music is good, and the gameplay is fun. I actually enjoy playing this game on mobile more than other platforms. Also waifus.",Positive
"I love the new update but i got an issues while play it in my phone. When i in game, the map isn't load fully and force leave the game. I tried restart and reinstall it but it won't work please fix this.",Positive
This game is probably one of the best gacha games I've played. The game is really friendly and generous towards free to play players. There is tons of story and endgame content to go through as a new player. The game is really polished and the developers really listen to player feedback.,Positive
10/10 best Hoyoverse game I've played so far (I haven't played Honkai Impact) while I'm waiting for Zenless Zone Zero knowing it's probably gonna be my favorite game out of all of them it take first place right now I love the Easter eggs to the other games and how unserious the game is at time the characters are beautiful and the turn based aspect is very good.,Positive
"If you are a Genshin player, you will easily enjoy this if you are more about strategy and thinking. It takes what Genshin has and improves upon them and gives what Genshin players ask for but never got in Genshin. I also like the setting and story as a Space Sci-fi Epic. I also see this game having so much potential and freedom with its world-building and character design.",Positive
I was having fun till the 2.0 update came and it's been buggy bc it's forcing me to re download the data to the point it making me run out of room so plz fix that bc I don't know why it's making me re download the data when I already did after I uninstalled it nd reinstalled it.,Negative
"Terrible ""game"", I literally autobattle everything. 0 content, the roguelike has no story in it and is essentially a weekly grind (that i'm sometimes too lazy to do). And since its too linear in structure (the only between characters is buffing&healing, the elements = weakness types, skill points are increased only by normal attack, instead of more complex systems like onmyoji souls, no disables besides frozen&imprisonment both glued to 2 elements) the powercreep is going to be terrible.",Negative
"So far, it's good when it comes to story line. But the main issue here is that it's frustrating to play because of the levels and the side quests. As it takes a lot of time to grind. Hopefully this game will be as great as Genshin.",Positive
"It's massive p2w game with uninsteresting events and takes too long to simply hand over the dailies. Characters will get powercrept and not pulling the latest character with a comp puts you at a disadvantage. You're forced to play like this and more, by playing around weaknesses the entire time while your only strategy is to buff your main dps and blow up the enemies ASAP. Also you can't explore and you can't jump.",Negative
Lag is going away now that I have it on lowest quality even with 5g wifi.. also the plot is dragged out. Spend more time watching them talk them playing. Becoming annoying af. And when you move the camera it doesn't let you go up and down side to side moost of the time. Makes finding graffiti take 500%s longer ...,Negative
The Graphic so good and the gameplay is also good,Positive
"This game is awesome,good graphics and the animation it's wonderful.",Positive
2.2 main story is so far the best lore i have ever read in a mobile game,Positive
Great game and all but when you don't play for like a week or so it removes your account. But I don't know if that happens to anyone else it only happend with my brothers account. Please fix this if possible. One of my favorite games,Negative
"Amazing game, I'm sure, but when I don't play for a while, it decides to restart all of my progress once I log back in. It's done this 3 times now and 3 times was enough for me to quit",Negative
"It was a good game, but I was wondering if you could fix a few errors I think. The first one is that the walls always lag, the second one is that I can't access to Eye of The Storm. It would mean a lot if you could fix it.",Positive
"For some reason, I accidentally clicked the log out button but when I try logging back to my account it says account or password error. I checked my notes to see if the password is correct but it was, it's still doing the same error over and over. and then I clicked the forgot password and when it was all done I logged in to my account and then I started at the very beginning of the game, I was crying because all the progress I made was all GONE. Its probably a bug. Pls fix this",Negative
"I thoroughly enjoy this game! The character design is incredibly satisfying, and the battle animations, as well as the skill animations, are simply fantastic.",Positive
i play this game because it has similarity with Epic7 (at least i think so) i just wish the currency for summoning were increase because rn 6 month of saving for your favorite character is insane to me... and the gear farming system i wish we could have more energy to farm more because rn it's really painful but even so i really like the game !,Positive
"It always flashes "" Login Failed, Eror 1001_2 "" then when i searched that eror it vome out it was about players internet connection. But when i checked mine, it does doing great but the game seem to refuse to played by me. I was waiting for it for the whole time, i even pre register. Im hoping you can fix this as soon as possible. Thank you ü§©",Negative
"I've been a fan of hoyo since the beginning of genshin, and honkai star rail in my opinion is one of their best games yet. I love The environment, graphics, storyline, character designs and a lot more Definitely recommend this game if you like turn based games",Positive
"I love the humor, lore, characters, combats.",Positive
"I started playing because of my friend and im glad i did. I didnt expect to be laughing so much until i discovered the trash cans, the person hidden under a manhole, the hotel closet scene and many more. I really hope there will be more funny stuff like these it makes exploring more enjoyable.",Positive
"Love turn based RPGs! Graphics are good, and the story is great so far. Needs controller support on Android devices, that will help with my hands cramping.",Positive
It's fun and the graphics are good but I kepted getting kick out at random times,Positive
I have dowloaded the game before. I lost all my data and had to start all over. The tutorial are extremely invasive. I played genshin impact its very similar. I know how the game works but the tutorial screwed me over more than actually helping me. Loss of data + invasive tutorial. It aint that good + the forced voice for that red head lady is a 3 star,Negative
"EXCUUUUSEE MEEE, I am physically unable to enter this game for it always crashes mid resource download. Even if the resources have fully downloaded, it will still crash. I have retried this so many times for the last few months and nothing worked. PS- Hiii bladie",Negative
"Hosnestly, although its not genshin impact i didn't realize it was an turn based game. Still has the great graphics and great storyline. However, definetly bugs and issues can be found quickly.",Positive
"Very fun game in general, There's some content that can be hard to clear but overall fun experience. The story's great, it is fair for f2p players aswell. Even if you dont have any experience on turn based rpgs you have to give this a try.",Positive
This game is great but it suffers from really bad decisions made from mihoyo. The story is an interesting Sci fi fantasy jrpg at its core and the battle system is just complex enough with characters to be fun and exciting. Music can be kind meh in some places. The issue comes from poor decisions by owner. Gacha system is the same as GI but with less f2p currency. They released the game too early with hardly any content. This is unacceptable. If there was more content idd be willing to bump to 4.,Negative
I don't like the fact that when you delete the game and come back you loose your account and the game restarts,Negative
"I don't wanna give this rating, but.... the offline event at MoA was terrible. My friends in other countries had more than enough freebies while we had to endure the scorching heat for hours only to get nothing! Not a single booth or a merch store. You can't even tell that there was an event!",Negative
"It's a good game with a fine playstyle although i'm experiencing alot of bugs, for example instead of seeing buildings and a floor all I see is a blank white screen & sometimes when I fight enemies everything just freezes and I can't click buttons ;(",Positive
"The game is amazing! But sadly I lost my account and I dont even know why. Im sure that I created that account with my email. and it seems connected with my email too. But when I try to enter that account It sends me to another account or creates another one.I cant enter to my account from other devices,or cant enter from my phone too.",Positive

"Beautiful turn based strategy game, with a decent story, highly detailed and stylish characters and last but not least... it's free.",Positive
Awesome game. Smooth graphic and superb storyline and display of skills. One complain though. My phone is overheating and this game drains my phone battery so fast . But excellent game devs. Just that i cant have an app that will overheat my phone.,Positive
"I. Absolutely. Love this game. I love the characters. The art style is cool, exploring trash is fun. The game is dynamic and your dialogue choices actually decide the outcome unlike other games where all options lead to same outcome. I adore most characters so far",Positive
"It starts out good, and is decently generous as far as hoyo gacha goes. (Still below what I've seen in most gacha) The story is great, and gameplay is decent overall. You can beat it without pulling premium characters, but you probably won't enjoy it. There are occasional difficulty spikes that are outside of a typical difficulty curve. Not good for casual players. The game's community is a toxic, elitist cesspool. Best to stay away.",Negative
"This is a amazing game, I play it on pc and phone but the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the latest update won't let me play, it loads till 2% or 40% then it shuts down, other then that everything about the game is amazing",Positive
I love the graphics and the characters' designs.,Positive
After the 1.1 update the game is totally unplayable it is extremely laggy and freezes almost every second even if I play it in lowest settings things don't change.please fix it version 1.0 was atleast playable but now it's just impossible.,Negative
"You guys are tripping. 1- THIS IS NOT LIKE GENSHIN! Its a turn base game. Don't leave a 1* review just because of that, it's dumb. 2- Imo, playing on pc is the better option. 3- NO you can't skip the stories. It's part of the game. If you don't like stories then find something purely combat based. 4- This game is not p2w in the slightest. If you actually PLAY you will proceed. Stop complaining about everything not being handed to you in the first few hrs. You're supposed to play daily.",Positive
This game is very amazing I love the Graphics And also The Characters I give this a rate of 100/100 I love this game :>,Positive
"The new production from Mihoyo might just be the new game to beat...eventually- as the game currently only has a week or two of content! If you like turn-based combat RPGs, and speak, um, any major language, you should enjoy this. Design-wise, it's flawless. CON: It has a TERRIBLE, below-standard 5 star gacha rate (0.6%) comparable to Genshin, so don't actually expect much if you give them your money. Same graphics quality as the aforementioned. Great VOs. I recommend SR for both mobile and PC.",Negative
IT IS TAKING WAY TO MUCH SPACE!!!!!! IT IS TAKING UP MORE SPACE THEN GENSHIN IMPACT!!!!!!!,Negative
Let me win a 50/50 please I love this game - lost 2 more times after writing this ):,Positive
It was fun but now it won't work bc I uninstalled hsr warp sim and idk what's going on,Negative
I love this game. I started playing it because of boothill and I'm addicted üíã,Positive
"Amazing game! Can't wait for new content. Fun whether you spend money on banners or build up currency free to play. One of the few games it might be more fun for free, every character feels good, unique, and impactful!",Positive
Lack of content is kinda bad for someone who plays HSR at least 3 hours a day...,Negative
"even though I always got hard pity and lost 50/50, love you star rail :(",Positive
Add skip button please! Icame here just for the character!,Negative
"My favourite hoyoverse game so far and it keeps getting better! The combat is actually fun, the QOL is great, Characters are gorgeous and have amazing voice acting and the stories keep getting better",Positive

Because the graphics is so good,Positive
this game is amazing but i will rate it 5 stars once i get sunday/jiaoqiu.!!! üòú,Positive
The game is good and the graphics are great. Only problem is that during fighting bosses and what not the recommended level for fighting is not accurate to the actually needed level,Positive
"Good games, but too dependant on gacha",Positive
"I NEVER WIN A 50/50 IN THIS GAME , AND DONT TELL BADLUCK , 15 LOSE IN A ROW NOOOTT AA BAADDD LLLUUUCCCCKKKKKK, I HAVE A E3 HEMIKO AND I NEVER PLAY HEERRR AND HER SIGNATURE S2 + THIS LOLI HEALER S2 AND STILL NEVER PMAY WITH HER AND HER SIGNATURE S2. JJUUSSTT PLEASE LOOK AT MY ACCOUNT",Negative
Verry good game its verry good but a little bit hard,Positive
Day 1 player and still absolutely love the game.,Positive
For no reason at all I tried to log in the game with my old account I tried my Facebook and Google and my account for no reason is gone pls fix this and my account name is cream or creampuff and the gender I chose is a girl pls fix this mess,Negative
"I love the game, but my account was randomly deleted. No clue why.",Negative
"Love it, may all the beauty bless my games",Positive
"Everything around me is black, I could only see the chest and characters. Why I can't spray in the Ruan Mei mission?",Negative
"Wasted all of my time collecting resources but only to lose the stupid 50/50, please keep yourself safe",Negative
Wish my game wouldn't crash literally just trying to load in,Negative
Star rail in one word amazing.,Positive
"No matter how much the bed shakes, she will not give birth hoyoverse Play like this great game üòâ",Negative
Too much for my taste But thank you for your effort,Negative
How it same size with genshin. Why the old event dont have full reward. NOT F2P FRIENDLY,Negative
Fix difficulty on game,Negative
Probably the best gatcha that anyone could ever play,Positive
It takes way too long to load,Negative
"love the game, so many adventures!!",Positive
"This game is just amazing, and it's f2p too !",Positive
One of the best turn based i have played keep it up,Positive
Edited: Average overall.,Positive
"This game marks the beginning of ""triple A"" mobile RPG gachas.",Positive
"Played a game about saving NPC life from commit suicide. Turns out, the very fundamental core of this game itself, cause major sucide and depression to its playerbase. Back to back pity 80 six time in a row, losing 50/50 indefinitely, nobody will investigate mihoyo for rigged/manipulate drop rate to further increase profit for their game. Utterly disgusting, nobody else who working for this dirty company deserve peaceful night sleep, nor life. You all do not deserve forgiveness.",Negative
"Jing Yuan :3 (I love this game but I don't know how to review it, so just ignore this.)",Positive
"The games is great and addicting. But the stamina system could be improve cause it feels lacking with almost everything has to be farm with stamina. And there's not much content as of now even when I take it slow the content really dry out and the update is still far away. I know this is gacha game but I only hope you can make stamina refill faster or just make some farming content, maybe ascension item stamina free. Edit: They actually increase stamina and add more content.",Positive
I lost my 50/50 on firefly's bannerüò≠ (nevermind i got her at 49 pity and won her lightcone),Positive
"just amazing,.. keep up the good worküëå",Positive
Pull acheron with its nihility gang and the meta healer. Thats all you need for this game tbh,Negative
space train game very epic,Positive
"This gane is really good, but the MB is really big",Positive
Getting better every patch,Positive
If you play Genshin Impact then this is the game for you! I love the characters animation when attacking. It feels like it gives it a Final Fantasy vibe with taking turns on when to attack and strategic planning <3,Positive
Cant open game unless i open it here on playstore,Positive
best turn based rpg with rich story,Positive
"isn't it better if caelus has the most stunning style of all as a main character because if you'll compare him to other characters like jingyuan or blade for example, he'll be just like an ordinary guard in the in the game. I'm talking about the way he cast his skills. too boring to see.",Negative
"Cant pass simulation world 2 even though my characters lvl is 40 and lightcone 40 while having Gepard on my team along Lynx. Leaving this game , its very frustrating. But i love this game alot and i can surly say that i wont forget this game that easily , euch a beautiful gacha game i ever played ‚ù§Ô∏è",Negative
Another awesome game Mihoyo. Nice idea about a turn based game with quality graphics and animation. The auto function is really helpful when grinding for materials. I wish Genshin Impact will have auto too when grinding for artifacts. But overall I enjoyed this just like when I first enjoyed playing Honkai Impact 3.,Positive
"it's a lovely game with cute characters and good lore. at first, it does seem kind of boring, but the second you get to the cities, it's a lot more fun :) gacha animation is really unique! this game is basically a genshin and honkai (impact 3rd) lovechild! this game is very worth your time, promise.",Positive
"Good game, though you do need a high end phone or pc to play this game because if you play on a potato device then you'd start experiencing frame drop and lag, people who are complaining about crashes and lag is probably because they have a rubbish device or rubbish internet,they are they blaming hoyoverse lmao Ôºå Overall great designs and animations of the characters .",Positive
"Amazing game, nice graphics and good story. However after downloading 1.2 update the game suddenly keeps crashing and i had to completely uninstall and install back the tons of GB. Idk if it even works still",Positive
"Generous and just overall a good experience. I've been studying and haven't had much time to spend on games but luckily, this game doesn't require that much grinding (compared to other games üíÄ) while still being fun to play.",Positive
"Literally my favorite game right now. Took all my favorite parts of Honkai 3rd and Genshin and made it into one game. Also fixed the problems their other games had. If you're looking to play another Hoyoverse game this is definitely for you and if to like fun story and turn-based combat, you'll like this too.",Positive
What I don't like is it is taking up soo much of my storage .If you are start the game for the first time you have to download for the game when you press play and it takes up so much of my storage so I can't play and because the storage is to high in the game it should be lower .Because some people want to play but they can't because of storage can you please change the storage so I can't play it anymore and I really want to .,Negative
"The lack of variety in skin tones is extremely disappointing. Especially when the culture was inspired by the Jazz age. I will no longer be spending any money on this game, and any other hoyoverse projects. I encourage others to do the same.",Negative
Balance your team. Equip 5* chs from all paths. Kinda frustrating I can't progress the main story due to losing after losing the pre-match Sunday boss (the trio). My team is lacking path of preservation. Be sure to not pull what you but PULL WHAT YOU NEED for those who played recently.,Negative
Hey... Its a good game and got nice graphics on it.. but after the recent update.. some of the characters idle got bug?? Like some parts just missing ... I dont understand... I hope there update on it.. thnks again for the amazing game. I really like it,Positive
"I love the game, but after the new update the game wouldn't get past loading screen and it would crash, so i reinstalled it and now it has trouble downloading all the resources.",Positive
"This is not a Honkai game, this is sci-fi Genshin Impact. The UI, the equipment, the battlepass, every mechanic is copied directly from Genshin, with a sprinkling of memberberries to con Honkai fans. All the characters are hybrids of existing Honkai/Genshin characters, where everyone is ""what if X was like Y"", with no payoff for Honkai Impact 3rd veterans. The turn-based system is superior to Genshin, as least for mobile, but I expect all the grind of Genshin is coming soon enough.",Negative
"... this game is all about luck. heroes, light cone, even armors also have random attributes. i want to perfectly build my character with my desired attributes, but.. my luck is not good. i spent 10 usd, and i feel its wasted, still got random attributes -,- need to have many trailblaze energy and grind armors as much as possible luckily i found aether gazer, at least i can build my character perfectly and strive to be the strongest",Negative
"I love everything about Star Rail. The characters, voice actors, world-building, story-telling, and even more notably, the developers' generosity. What a truly great experience HSR has been, and likely will continue to be.",Positive
"This Game is My Personal Favourite, The Best Turn-Based RPG Ever.",Positive
"Quite frankly the story is Eh. It the characters dont shut the hell up or they dont at all. Characters designs are whatever. Some fit with the Scfi nature, but others have no place in a setting such as thus game. Combat is genuine repetitive to the point of a being a chore to do. Grinding so many stages just to have a decent chance at a boss or encounter. Gacha sucks as per Hoyo games. Having to wait banner after banner till the unit you need (not want) shows up again. To probably lose the 50/50",Negative
"Game of long dialogue. No skip and boring mission. No one read the dialogue that long and slow. I play this game for battle, character and build stronger.",Negative
It takes a lot of storage. I had to download something that is 3000 MB/ 3 GB. And then I had to download something that is 18+ GB/ 18000 MB. And you need to have a new phone or a tablet or it will be laggy and need to play on low graphics.,Negative
"I truly love this game it's so cool the characters are so unique and have their own little story.BTW the story is absolutely amazing and with each patch it doesn't disappoint.Eventhough it's a gacha game I really don't think anyone needs to spend money,but it's not the case if you want every single character of the new patch because they are just that good and creatively written. Thankyou HSR for giving such a great game to play really appreciated.üëç",Positive
Love the game(story writing and gameplay). Been playing it since launch. It is good as a side-game and to keep you committed into something. Very play-to-win friendly.,Positive
"i love all the little fun things they put for you to explore and make different choices. Plus, amazing characters and the gameplay is just too good. I liked genshin, but this is just way better for me.",Positive
"Smooth loading, relatively accessible even for older devices like my phone and laptop. Quirky and interesting characters with a very promising storyline so far. HSR has certainly exceeded my expectations currently. May you keep up the good work!",Positive
This game is amazing. The story line is interesting and the character design is cool. It would be nice if it was a multiplayer game tho. Overall one of the best games I have on my phone.,Positive
Worst battle event ever in 4.3 If anyone want to download this game make sure spend lots of money to clear content.. You can't beat new event game is for whale.. I am playing this game for 1.5 years & this event is one of worst...,Negative
"Again, with lack of representation. Penacony is meant to represent the jazz age? Then, add poc. But that's my only complaint for this game - even though I only downloaded it once. I uninstalled it a month ago. I am glad I did not come back. I will no longer be supporting HYV games. Do better!!!",Negative
"The male to female ratio and meta-defining characters are insane. We got 2 meta-defining female supports since penacony and 1 future male support (jiaoqiu) looking kinda or about to be bad, not even comparable to these female supports. Boothill getting powercrept right away firefly and getting only 1 trailer while FF got at least 3. ACHERON. The gender preference is showing and i hate it. Since 2.0, theres has only been 2 male limited 5* and bunch of women. In new XZ teaser, only 2 are males. TF",Negative
"This game i used to extremely enjoy a lot, the characters are well done BUT with one issue being the skintones. The skintones are a huge problem in this game and for any other game I've played.",Negative
"Love the game and story, really feels that the developers are putting effort into this. Game mechanics are fun for those who play turn based and the dialogue is hilarious. Music is also a delight and I enjoy listening to it. Can't wait to see what comes next.",Positive
Game has been hella laggy. I have a stable connection and it's having stutter issues for some reason since the last couple updates. I have a Note 10+ and it's able to run at max graphics.,Negative
"This has a fighting system like the original final fantasy games or Lufia fortress of doom. However, the graphics are amazing. The download is quick, and it has lots of different characters",Positive
"I haven't played a lot of this but from where I'm right now , i hate the gameplay cos i have played genshin impact. If it was just for the story I'd rather watch anime, i wish this game wasn't turn based. The animations are nice but there is limitations to your movement at most places and it feels like u're freedom is restricted.",Negative
"Deleted my gameplay after not being on it for two weeks or so,restarted my whole game,I had good characters and alot of them were 5 stars,and they're all gone.",Negative
"All the characters in this game are somehow whiter than I am and I'm pale enough to be a reflective surface. The few characters that have a smidge of melanin have kits so terrible that no one wants to pull for them. Also Arlan's talent names? What is wrong with you. As tempted as I was to spend some money for Jiaoqiu, it can wait until some changes are made~ üíö",Negative
"Trying to control a character in a 3d space with a touch screen sucks. It's not unplayable, just super frustrating.",Negative
"Mad respect for the devs of this game. A RPG that i fell in love with the characters and the way they interact with eachother. A Gacha game were 4* have as much backstory as 5* , and their kit is comparable. I like to usually nitpic and call out what can be improved but all I wish for is for the team working on this game to have the same passion for it as they started even years from now!",Positive
"Gameplay is great, graphics is awesome, only thing is that once you've finish the quests, your play time per day is cut down to a few mins due to trailblazer energy (stamina) regeneration.",Positive
"I love the designs, the lore, the original weapons and attacks that the characters have, the story,... All! The game never stops improving the little things, too, which feels great",Positive
I cat install it. I logged in and then the download starts it gets to 5% and then it crashes. I tried it on two devices and the same thing happens.,Negative
The game is really fun and gives out lots of free stuff which makes grinding a lot easier but In my opinion the stellar jades earned from missions are too low and should be given more.,Positive
"I love it! It is way more fun than Genshin Impact in that it is easier to get crystals to get characters and the puzzles are actually enjoyable. Plus, it's turn-based!",Positive
"I want to download this on my laptop/windows,but then it just kicks me off when I try play I would give a video as an example but I'm not sure if you can do that here. It's basically just March 7th/the logo with ! In red with it loading at the bottom.Idk what to do.",Positive
Amazing game. It's not a game that you have to sink hours into to get results out of it. And you can be completely F2P and get the characters you want as long as you don't go around wasting shards on garbage.,Positive
"It was good gameplay and amazing viewing But the problem is, I turn on and off my airplane mode but I did it on the app which causes it to make me log in again, I say, this is my fault, but now I cant log in, I tried seeing my IM3 but I still have 40gb of quota, I tried opening youtube and tiktok even one of my online games, they all work well so I dont understand why I can log in. .",Negative
Pretty great game despite being a turn-based one. It receives QOLs that GI doesn't have but sorely needs. It's a great game but in no means is it better than Genshin. They're pretty similar for me. The Gacha banners here feel better(look at that light cone banner and standard banner) I won't rate it any higher tho coz it's still Hoyo.,Negative
"Dogshit launcher on pc, down vote as much as possible so they fix it.",Negative
"the experience was ok but the battles are just a fixed camera and u mash some buttons u win and that's it and yes the story is great and all including the music and lore unlike it's impact counter part genshin impact it's just like a beta but with Acheron instead of archon Ang izuma instead of inazuma, I think u get what I mean I'm just saying I was expecting a lot but not that much since genshin is 30gb of storage and star rail is just 10 but still it's enjoyable",Positive
"My gameplay is still a little laggy, but it's super fun to play, especially its story and the side quests. Although my phone is mid at playing the game meaning my phone can handle it but it still lags alittle.",Positive
"Well its really good actually, have many features and qol for players, the evebt is much more fun, but sometimes playing this game feels tiring, my gacha especially so bad, always get spooked always the hard pity (80-ish pulls), it's a good game nevertheless, but for someone who prioritize collecting character, don't hope so much.",Positive
i'm quite disappointed as a new player. I lost my 50/50 two times in limited character banner and EVEN lost my 75/25 two times in limited lightcone banner. The gacha system feels like a scam for me.,Negative
Things that I don't like about the game as of now: 1. You need to walk for long distances just to do a quest. 2. The tutorial is freaking long. 3. You must have a high end phone to play this game or else you'll end up with low resolution blurry game. 4. The combat takes too long to finish even on early stages like seriously.,Negative
The ratio between female and male characters is pretty bad.,Negative
"I enjoy this game a lot, from the music to the character designs , it's all so nice! Sure the wishing system is annoying as always, but it's not annoying enough to drag the game down, not to mention this is a nice change of pace from a totally open world game, I can't explain how much I love this game*",Positive
"This is the perfect example of the best game award. F2p-friendly, not too time-consuming, actually funny and the 4th wall breaking dialogues. The team for this game is generous with rewards too. And as a result, the community is less toxic compared to the Genshin community. No CN VA was bullied because the character's bad and no cats were slain because of similarity towards a character. I would've given it an 10 star if it's a feature on Google Play Store.",Positive
If your into turn based JRPG with diverse characters. Check this game out,Positive
"The game is free-to-play friendly, nice animation, filled with interesting characters and great storytelling, nice endgame which can be quite challenging, but rewarding experience.",Positive
"Love this game. If u are a fan of turn base RPGs, I highly recommend",Positive
"Game is amazing, but it has no controller support on Android but from what I've searched up it has controller support for IOS which is insane to me. IOS only has 22k ratings while android has well over 250k ratings which would mean more people play it on Android and not IOS so why don't we have controller support like IOS. I will not be buying any more in game product into controller support is added UNIVERSALLY. It's unfair and unjust to all the players on Android.",Negative
"There are several things wrong with this game and company. They do not care for any diversity in their games, HSR included. They also have Storage problems and FPS problems in every single one of their games, as you can find in countless of these reviews. I recommend you don't waste your money while playing, or better yet, don't play at all.",Negative
"Pretty good so far, the only thing is that there's a bit of lag while playing, but the battle sequence is smooth. The art and music is just as expected beautiful.",Positive
Game is pretty good and has a decent story but the loot pool is to watered down by cards. It's still overall a good game. I just think $200 for like 80 pulls and having a 90 pull pity is overall not great especially when they want you to pull 6 of 1 character for max potential. I give the game a 4 star but the generosity for the gacha is pretty mid so far even the 50 pulls for a 5* at start is poor it woulda just been better to have a free 10 reroll. Like 2-3 star on the gacha system.,Positive
"I've been playing since release day, there's only one playable dark skinned character so far and his kit is awful, his skills names are awful too. The designs for dark-skinned characters (NPC too) have repetitive and uninteresting. But repetitive designs is an issue on itself.",Negative
Phenomal game with amazing story but after the 2.0 update the game keeps crashing. Usually right before combat begins. Never had this issue before this update.,Negative
"The game is really good, but theres this bug where when i receive or claim stellar jades they decrease",Positive
"I heard mixed reviews, and after playing I live it even more than I thought. The detail, and everything along the lines are phenomenal, the gameplay is smooth and rewarding. Thank you for such a good game, and keep it up",Positive
"Came back to the game after not playing for a while. First fight of the new storyline keeps glitching. It happens randomly during the fight but when an attack is made, suddenly the character attacking just hangs and starts twitching back forth through whichever movement they were doing. Gonna reinstall and try again.",Negative
"Great game, nice story, awesome characters. Les time consuming and stressful compared to genshin. But still gatcha game ofc. I find it better balanced and a lot 4star and free chars are really useful.",Positive
Screen suddenly blank? Happened today,Negative
"I really enjoy this game! The characters are very cute, although the male characters are lacking good character design and look like npcs. If you are a genshin player who is deciding to start star rail, don't be afraid. this will not explode your phone.",Positive
It won't work!? üò≠ Whenever i start the game i keep getting stuck on the loading screen and worst the uia disappeared I've tried reinstalling and clearing the data even the cache it just won't work please help,Negative
"I want to like the game but sadly it have the same system that made me hate/quit Genshin being the relics system. In both games, if I was about to farm them without being limited by their stamina system, It would be soooo much better or if you can use premium currency to refresh it an unlimited amount of times( 10 premium currency per, with no increase cost or daily limit). I doubt this game would do it but if it does, then I be 100% back to change the rating and download the game again.",Negative
"Art : Good; Music : Fine; Main Story : Fine; (world 1 being rushed; world 2 already kill npc which is bad on mu opinions; world 3 has weird story being filled for main story); side story: fine, no extra story for protagonist (seele, bronya so far sadface); Gacha : Good; Voice : Good for JP (No opinion about EN, KR, CH cuz I'm not using it); edit: 7 Agustus patch 1.2 : i hate the script writer so much. overall : 4/10. (considering drop the game) don't try this game if u want happy story",Negative
This game is so bloated with unskippable cutscenes and dialogue. Maps are pretty barren as well. I was excited for this game but honestly in its current state i think its a really bad experience. I dont even care about the gacha rates the actually game is non existent. This is a visual novel.,Negative
"Their slow poses during each chat box are kinda cringe, but other than that it's a pretty good game. I thought it'd be like genshin impact (which I find overhyped and boring) but it's way better üëç.. That is unless you enjoy meaningless long distance travel via genshin..",Positive
"The gameplay, the graphics, the story, it's amazing. I love this game so much. Don't forget the OST too it's so freaking amazing especially Wildfire when you fight Cocolia. It's amazing.",Positive
"Amazing time killer when I have nothing else to do, way more generous than Genshin. at first I was turned off by the turn based combat but then I kept on playing and started to enjoy it alot. Great game 10/10",Positive
"Playing this game has been incredibly memorable, and it offers a great sense of achievement with its unique advantages, such as immersive graphics, challenging gameplay, and a supportive online community, I've made alot of friends during my journey so i hope you enjoy this game as much as i do.",Positive
"Everything about this game is just top-notch. my only problem was the ""force close"" that happened occasionally when I reached the second (close-up train) login page, and there was nothing wrong when I tried to re-verify resources",Positive
"Super fun and easy to learn, There are no issues with gameplay or lag, This game has already shown it has such good graphics, art, voices and the storyline is amazing so far! It seems this game will only get better! :D",Positive
As much as i want to play this I can't. Since there are still no information whether console version will release. Im afraid i cant participate on any events/banner or something that is happening ingame but will still be supportive to this game. I just hope i can still experience this after the release of console... Hope this reach out to you devs.... Just gives us a chance to participate in the same events/banner that is currently happening when the console version is out...,Positive
"I love this game and I haven't encountered any problems until now. Everytime I use Imbibitor Lunae Dan heng's burst my game crashes and restarts my phone. I tried restarting my phone, closing the game but it still happens. I haven't tried using the other characters bursts so I'm kinda hoping that this problem is only on dan heng's part since I'm able to use Bronya's burst with no problem. (Edit: Welt's burst also crashes the game and I'm not gonna try and find out who else can do it)",Negative
"Giving it 3* for now because there isn't enough content for me to get sufficient jades. My RNG is terrible in the current banner. Seeing my friend pull Seele in 2 tries and her weapon in 20 tries discouraged me from spending more on the game as I took 76 pulls for seele, and am at 57 tries (and counting) for the weapon. What makes it worse is that not having Seele now makes it impossible to clear the formidable foes on the map as she's way stronger than the ones you can get on standard banner.",Negative
How bad are the pull rates? I did 8 10 pulls of a lost soul and havnt gotten blade. I didn't even get a character on my 7th and 8th pulls only cards. Being a new player this is off-putting. What motivation would i have to spend money if its this bad. The game itself is alright. Occasionally stutters and crashes Edit make that 10 10 pulls trying for blade and 5 regular 10 pulls from getting the other pass while grinding. Total of 15 10 pulls between the 2 and still no 5 star. What the rates,Negative
It's fun and not as laggy as genshin impact but the auto feature is very broken. It'll most of the time target the enemies with counters and your team will die. So it's ok I guess...,Negative
the game is awesome but there's too much waifu in it...pls add more male char in it..smh,Positive
"The game is very good, the story also is very good, honestly the way they made this turn based game unique in a way that makes it more enjoyable than expected.",Positive
"A fantastic game. The second story arc is weak, but the events and gameplay are phenomenal and the voice acting is stellar. Leaps and bounds better than GI in terms of QoL and improvements.",Positive
"Great game! I have no complain about graphics. It has interesting narration,awesome characters and intriguing story. Only complain I have about is there is no chat feature with friends in the game. Why add friends when you can't even text them?",Positive
"This game is great! I love it. However, can we please get the option to skip cutscenes, and a better filter system for relics and cones in the inventory?",Positive
"It's a nice game, I use it as a replacement for genshin, doesn't take up that much space, fun, addicting. Would recommend to anyone. It lags a bit, but not as much. :)",Positive
"In my opinion, this is the best game from Hoyo. Love the mechanics, the character design, music, background, everything so far. It runs smoothly on both my phone and PC.",Positive
"Login error, its always showing at my screen i did everything that i could and watched some YouTube vid how to fix this login error but nothing changes. i just want to play this game and try it out, but this problem made me mad at the moment. it dosent let me play!",Negative
"not a big fan of the characters, turn based combat or storyline. overall characters are forgettable and its very limiting on where you can go. it's difficult to avoid combat which is painful and boring and characters are one-trick ponies in that they are either dps, buffer, shielder or healer. unlike genshin you cant really make a healer hit big damage. go ahead, try it out, but it's just not for me which is a shame given how popular it is. i dont really get the hype with it.",Negative
I was reading some comments on this game the other day where ppl said that they expected this game to be boring since it was turn based gameplay but they enjoyed it more than they expected and played it for long durations of time at a stretch....so i thought i would give it a go....and boi they were right....the story and graphics are too addicting....a nice breath of air for players who play genshin,Positive
okay it finally login and the game was fun and the story is really good and really interesting the characters design are 10/10 the only problem I have is... again the loginü•≤ I closed the game to do some house chore but when I tried entering again it keep saying login errorü•≤ü•≤,Positive

"It is both vivid and colorful, one of the best RPG handhelds I've ever played",Positive
I love playing the game but there's always an log in error 1001_0 pls fix this error hoyoverse,Negative
Changing to 1 star for the difficulty spike in MoC and PF as well as the upcoming bloated enemy HP you'll be adding next update. The game is becoming gacha whale territory,Negative

"hello hoyo, I'm trying to be nice here but whoever create battle mechanics in Aventurine battle.... I hate them with passion. Listen, I'm an adult with responsibility so I have to work, when I have free time I will play the game to RELAX and enjoy the story. BUT it's frustrating to stuck on some point because of the dumb battle, can you guys at least LET THE PLAYERS CHOOSE THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL??? I'M HERE TO CHILL NOT TO DPS DMG HERE AND THERE. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. I JUST WANT TO PLAY",Negative
"Great game, I love its lag and freezes even though the net is fine and good, love it",Positive
"Some huge lag issues loding the game, but the game itself is great.",Negative
It's awesome. Finished every update first chance I got. Was to excited for the lore.,Positive
Only 10pulls for the big first anniversary ?? Looks like HSR becomes as stingy as Genshin. Won't be spending anymore money (except for skins if they release one day..). Also moc boss resign are becoming as lazy as genshin's... Shame such a great game goes downhill so fast,Negative
Bravo üëè this games storyline is amazing it's been days since I played a rpg that makes me think of it as a 100/10üëç,Positive

Love the game. Would love if there was a story skip button.,Positive
Game is way too big had to uninstall it on mobile really missed playing it I hope it comes to Xbox One,Negative
Better than genshin impact but the artifact and memory got problem another game i played for years will be deleted one day.. mihoyo are not making this fair and easy like why have to go through all the time and efforts just to come out empty in the end nowdays games wants you to spend your money and life on they games people who are working and poor don't have time for that your people never think of the back,Negative

"Way better game than Genshin! I'm playing both games, and Honkai is way more generous than Genshin is!",Positive
"A year later and it's a fantastic game with tons to do and amazing 5* characters like Fu Xuan, Sparkle, Dr.Ratio and Acheron make people happy, as well as the frequent updates for endgame content, dunno if Hoyoverse has different teams for Genshin and HSR but the devs for Genshin really need to learn from the HSR guys to improve their game.",Positive
"Nahhh best turn based rpg game for sure!! In my opinion this is better then genshin,and I'm waiting for Kafka second rerun:)",Positive
Best game ever and the graphic is awwsome !!! So real life .,Positive

"I can't log in since I updated version 1.1, it's always error log in 1001_3 for more than a day",Positive
"Ugh terrible game, gacha shouldn't exist without giving everyone good enough characters to at least make the game playable",Negative
Always have login error i log in 10 times now and still can't open it,Negative
My app is not working for me anymore it keeps on saying that my network is not working but it is what do I do can anyone help?,Negative
Me just trying to play a game and THEN for no reason IT HAD TO DOWLOAD AGAIN I WAITED FOR 2 WHOLE DAYS BUT ITS STILL LOADING work on ur games atleast,Negative
Nice game best graphics but for mobile players this will be some difficult,Positive
When the game got updated my data that i profress got restarted.,Negative
I love this game but the GB are way to much for my phone wish sucks but ya irdk why they want that much GB on android and iso phone but it Wirth itüò≠,Positive
"From the beginning of the game until now, I always give hard pity, just try to get below 40 pity",Negative

Try to load it a number of times and still said needs more storage fmm 36gig not enough well fxxx you,Negative
Can be as chill as you want or as grindy as you want. F2p friendly. The writers know how to be funny and how to twist the knife. It has the single most captivating boss fight i've played in 25 years of gaming. Its the only game I play with the sound on.,Positive
"It's fun and interesting, I love this video game, this is the best.",Positive
"I rate this game 5 star even tho I can't even play. WELL I really want to play this game but my phone tho. I waited this game to release but I couldn't play, It always crash on loading screen I couldn't even make to the first story I'd try everything ""watch tutorials on yt, reset my phone etc.."" but still my phone is vivoy15A I know this phone was really cheap but I don't have a work I'm still a student so I couldn't buy new, please can you fix the loading screen, I just wanted to play this game",Positive
"Lost my account after update, had a dedicated sign on, hadnt played for a couple days, came back, i was signed off and my normal login wasnt recognized and cannot be found, made me start over, lost seele, bronya, silverwolf and a few others. Discouraging in the least",Negative
After update the game become so laggy whenever i use ultimate in calyx its lag af i need to force stop the app,Positive
"I can wholeheartedly recomennd this game to everyone who values the highest quality graphics, ear-melting voiceovers, and mindblowing battles. You can see that many ppl has put their hearts and souls into creating this game and this fabulous storyline in which the more you play the more you cant get enough off. To creators of the game - You guys can really be proud of yourself and your hard work on it, all of this pays off! One of the best games I played so far üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª‚ù§",Positive
"fun game, usual gacha shenanigans for pulls, great design and story, even the side quests have detail. The only complaint i have is that the app takes wayyy too much space on my phone, currently eats up 20gb, i might have to delete it if it gets any larger.",Negative
I love the interactive story driven gameplay. It gives you dialogue options that makes it feel like your choices imprints with your progression. Beautiful character designs and soundtracks.,Positive
"After playing more or less than a week, Im really highly recommend this game! Pros : - Everything is amazing (Graphic, Character, Sound) - Turn based jrpg with an immersive story - An open world but not really open world) Cons : - Gacha for meta character - After finishing all story including side story, sometimes stuck to leveling up and only playing daily - A showcase for p2w Conclusion : If you're jrpg lover, try this game with japaneses languange, and you can feel it like anime story :D",Positive
"The game has really nice graphics and smooth movement and fps, and it has a really good storyline, the combat however isn't quite as skillful as I'd like, but overall I think it is a great game",Positive
Lesser lag and better framerate with the recent update,Positive
"Honestly, this game is really all I play and for an android game, tis good. The gameplay is good and I do appreciate that you don't necessarily have to BREAK yo bank in order to obtain or make characters stronger. Sure the grinding gets tedious. HOWEVER... ü§£ BOY! Does THIS game bring me back! üòë like remember the days with NO NET and we ALL had to WORK to make the game great! So, WELL DONE! ü•∞",Positive
"Is this an anime? This would be crazy!!!! I'm definitely digging this game, and I'm getting paid to play it",Positive
"I LOVE IT. Not because I'm bias, but I actually enjoy it despite being turn-based. The gameplay, the characters, the world, literally everything about it is fun in my eyes.",Positive
"The new swarm gamemode event is terrible, it waste so much of your time for you just being one shotted on the final boss and have to redo all of it again and putting small rewards behind it to waste hours of your life, who would think this is a good idea, i dont understand",Negative
Is it normal to download 13 GB of data just to do pre download?,Negative
"Graphics is good, storyline is good, and details of people are good overall good game but it lacks optimization in mobile in order for low end devices people to play it.",Negative
One of the best turn based rpg with the ease of cross platform. The story is engaging and the characters are quite fleshed out. 10/10 would recommend!,Positive
This is what I wanted from genshin. Genshin open world was too big where I had no time to explore. I had to mine ores and pick flowers which was time consuming. But hsr is everything what I wanted. Just spend 5-15mins daily and weekend on simulator and mirror. My 3xl can handle hsr compare to genshin although there are still lag moments. 4 star because no game is perfect. After all this is gacha,Positive
"Great graphics,and honestly its a really fun game I recommend it for 10+.The only issue I've had with the game was updating version 1.3 but other then that it really is a great game for people who like action and funny dialog.",Positive
Love its lore and character design! Keep it up,Positive
"Wow... Just... Wow... running on max specs are a huge battery drain... but super worth it. I have tried Genshin, and Honkai: Impact... but this is amazing. I love it... I can't think of any mobile game I've liked this much. 10/10 game. Only qualm is my own bad luck... but that's not the games fault.",Positive
Optimize to lower quality especially the frickn train when you open the game the graphics animation on the train is so frickn lag. I'm playing on a 4gb ram phone and damn the train makes it so laggy and takes like 2 to 4 mins for me to tap the start and the worst part of logging in is that after I tap the start the game would notify to reopen the game again and now back to step 1. At least make it simple. I don't mind playing on low quality,Negative
Been waiting for this game only to have log in issues. No definite fix and sis my research that others are able to resolve it with different methods through PC version but what about mobile? Hopefully this will be fixed or I'll think that this game never existed and move on. UPDATE Through research found one solution that worked.,Negative
One of the very best games ever made. 10/10 I love honkai star rail.,Positive
Why does it always show error code 0 when I am on my cellular data while I can play other games and download files at the speed of 2-4mbps because of this I cannot even enter the game. What's the point of downloading it when I just have to stare at the loading screen. And I have already tried all the ways possible to fix it but they didn't work. Please fix this issue ASAP.,Negative
"I am gagged by the new update. The enemies, the whole concept, the design, the special mechanics is fire asf(as always) Perfection and 10 10 10 across the board",Positive
"I stuck on the train loading screen, after a while it pops up a login menu. What matters is the verifying load forever and it said network problem. I don't have any issue with my network connection.",Negative
I love the game its a little buggy on the a54 I turned the resolution to lowest and it started to glitxh out and wouldnt let me in the game without it freezing on the menu but I can still interact with thz ui the screen doesnt update doe..,Positive
"Honeslty i love it People say that turn based games are boring and what-not but this is my first turn based game and i absolutely love it The characters, the story and some small funny stories and cameos here and gere make it ver enjoyable The battle and gacha mechanics are easy to understand after playing for a while (albeit i did play genshin before this)",Positive
"In my opinion, i kinda hate it but like it because i got like good 5 star. that all i gotta say. there will be more, yet. that all.",Negative
the story the music grafic are all amazing!,Positive
"They gave out a free 5 star character as thank you for winning Mobile game of the year award in 2023, least I could do is give 5 stars back. No but seriously HSR is a great Turn-based RPG though the story gets messy after Belobog and grinding relics/leveling materials is tedious it's overall an excellent game.",Positive
"Game so good , shawty got me into gambling addiction.",Positive
As for new player like me. Other codes are expired already. The game was launched in less than a month. The players who would download and play today should be still considered as new. Still would rate 3 stars because the game is great but have a bad management.,Positive
"A very fun turn based game, and a very generous too",Positive
Good game! I have set graphics to very low yet it runs very smoothly. I like the character designs and the idea that you can use phones in the game üëç,Positive
"As a genshin player and fan star rail doesn't disappoint, love the turn based gameplay and much easier to play on mobile than genshin although genshin feels nicer on pc tbh as star rail is far linear but still has an open world vibe as you are able to travel back and forth as you wish. Gives a fair amount of free stuff especially within the first 35 trailblazer lvls for regular summons and guaranteed 5 star characters through starter banner, 300 pull banner and every 90 pulls per banner. üëç",Positive
Love the game but the problem is after the loading to launch the game sometimes it shows error login or the game just stuck at a black screen. Hope this kind of error is fix in android devices.,Negative
Never playing this again. Won't let me sync my playstation and phone accounts. Ended up having to delete my phone account and it still didn't sync. So I basically have to start over. Deleting all accounts and uninstalling.,Negative
"Battery gets too warm when running 60 FPS. Even turned down the graphics to reduce load and attempt to cool the GPU/CPU. It still got too warm where my phone stopped charging due to the battery getting too warm during gameplay. So, be warned anyone that plays on a S21+ Ultra 5G. The game will cause your battery to heat up when running 60 FPS with downgraded graphics settings..",Negative
"After update 1.1, I can't log in anymore. Keep crash error 1001_3. There no issue with my internet connection. I suspect that this game renders very hard, then It affects the network. Please fix it hoyoverse!?",Negative
Great game! Have been playing it nearly every day since it has the turn style and graphics that remind me of my favorite game Xenosaga. Maybe will do a Xenoblade cross over since would be most fitting given Monolith uses a very similar style game play already.,Positive
I would rate it more than this but due fact I could only play twice due to the error codes üòû eg-1001_3 602_1 And I looked for many ways to fix it after going through ways to fix and no changes I decided to uninstall and install it but still the same results I am writing this to hope that HOYOVERSE fix this in there next update,Negative
"Fun, good story, nice art style. This is a turn based RPG. The gacha has terrible rates, but the free characters are good. They are stingy with the end-game energy, so don't expect much play outside the main storyline.",Positive
"I love this game but there is an issue, the game has deleted my accounts 3 times already and making me restart and it's gotten really annoying just now it deleted my account and it was level 31 and it had 2 5 start characters (Jing yuan and welt) I'm giving up the game now because of this but it's a really fun game",Negative
"Been playing since launch. Great story and characters, nice environments, combat is very fun. Endgame has good variety and auto battle makes the tedious farming and grinding easy. Prefer this over Genshin. Oh also this game is more generous for F2P.",Positive
"I'm gonna be honest a lot of reviews of this game are just ""Genshin better ü§ì"" so here's my opinion, if you want a genshin clone stick to genshin. Now I personally really enjoy Star rail, and so far I've had no problems running it on my Samsung Galaxy s22. I love the story and characters and while the fighting system might not be everyone's cup of tea I personally really enjoy it.",Positive
Impressive the story cutscene animation is awesome,Positive
"This game is fun, but I best pull Firefly when she comes up or I'll CRY.",Positive
Beautiful art and open world exploration. Repetitive combat and lots of grinding. Also the optimization could be better: lags even on average devices.,Positive
At the start that silver wolf didn't came it was all good and now it's not. It's been really buggy like the train isn't even there you can only see the npc and not the background or the houses of the game and I really enjoyed the start but now it's not can you please fix this HOYO üò≠üò≠,Negative
"Honestly shock bout bad reviews down there but overall there's nothing happend with the game (in my opinion), so far so good even on gacha, cool music and its enjoyable to listen while afk (on train), for grind its not really hard just manage the time and it's quiet fast, well f2p still can survive even though theres many whales out there.",Positive
"Such a bad game considering who develop this game, first one being unnecessarily using so much data (10GB in 4 days) when playing that was finally fixed by re-installing the game. Now when i update this game, its asking to re-download the original file amount to 6GB. This game is nothing but a failure and no more than a bloatware, so disappointed.",Negative
"i'm having problems lately.. my star rail account kept being logged off and everytime I log in it wouldn't let me, it would say ""Wrong password"" I've completely checked the password multiple times and it's right spelling and stuff but it still wouldn't, it would freeze me for twenty mins, I've also tried changing my password it worked at first but the next day i was logged off again and wouldn't let me in, please let me know what to do... I'm playing on my cousins phone and I used my own gmail",Negative
"This game is amazing, The story in belobog and penacony was good, though xianzhou luofu was kinda underwhelming but its alright! I also love the characters, they are all so loveable and the game mechanics, its just so much more fun compared to genshin. The rewards are also much much better than genshin.",Positive
"The gameplay is incredible and so are the graphics, but it drains my battery kinda fast. The game is well-made, I love the character designs, and it's fun.",Positive
"Best turn-based game I've ever played although the story is a bit bland compared to granblue fantasy but still the graphics, vfx, characters, music, and gameplay is the best of the best.",Positive
The storyline of this game is interesting and hilarious. They also made a messaging system to make players more convenient when receiving quests. The chests also gives rich rewards like materials. Pretty decent for a f2p game. Recommended game to play in 2023.,Positive
"I absolutely loved this game and was very exited when it first came out. I ended up deciding that the combat and story behind hoyoverse's other game, genshin impact was a lot more fun. I hope this game grows to be as big as genshin and I wish the developers luck!",Positive
"It's pretty fun, and the characters are enjoyable with a good personality. The only reason this isn't a 5-star review is because it's been difficult to consistently play the game, as it is always a second pick for me in terms of gacha games. Luckily for you, Mihoyo, Honkai Impact 3rd is the first pick for me!",Positive
Very good game kinda addicted to it but there are some bugs that i accidentally found when switching to low to high graphics the games resolution just became white but overall a good game. But it lags to much not like genshin impact why tho?,Positive
"Pretty cool, The gameplay's not bad and graphics are pretty. The story intresting as well. I hope it won't have much problems in the future.",Positive
"I am supposed to play @ my laptop but then I just got stuck on the Eye of the Storm mission where in our protagonist just woke up & about to rendezvous with April 26, BECAUSE I AM SUPPOSED TO HOLD LEFT ALT KEY TO VIEW CHARACTER MENU The right Alt is fine just that damn left alt, why?! Even on Genshin I have to resort to just pressing Esc or Enter to edit my Serenitea pot or access the menus on the upper right of ingame screen except inventory or character's equip & profile voicelines.",Negative
"I wasn't a fan of turn base or gacha games, but the story and characters really drew me in. It's also pretty free-to-play friendly since there are multiple ways you can earn the currency to get the characters you want.",Positive
"Very fun to play nothing else to say. The character design is really nice, hoping it have many things to do after you finish the main story such as more exploration(chest) puzzle and so on",Positive
"I started playing this a month ago. It was the second half of v1.6, free ratio plus a ton of past events that are playable. And there's free 10 pulls per patch. Genshin could never. So this game is 5 stars!",Positive
"Once i play this game I can't stop.. it's really well made. The character, the story, the mechanics and gameplay is superb. The voice act and music are marvelous. ü§©ü§©",Positive
"Dev, can you please make the default battle speed a little bit faster? It was too slow some attack looks weird and too slow. The fast forward system is too fast for me to enjoy the battle animation speed. Thank you .",Positive
"The game has good graphics, story, gameplay, characters, voices, and its a pretty chill game. But only 1* becoz Hoyoverse please notice my concern regarding the trace materials. Why is the drop rate for blue and purple rarity of trace material upgrade so low? why does it take so much to convert? I would like to suggest you either increase drop rate or just let the conversion be 2 mats = 1 instead of 3=1 because it doesn't seem worth to spend trailblazer power to farm. Pls do something. thank you",Negative
"It's a good game fun gameplay,good story and amazing character design but the amount of grind you need to level up your character is just insane even genshin is not this bad the resource you need to level up one character is just ridiculous",Negative
"Just love the game. Decent pacing, addicting game play for me, and if you like having goals shown to you so you can hunt towards completion it does that pretty well while also having hidden secrets.",Positive
"Sometimes when I play the game my screen would go black, even if I was in the middle of a fight the game would crash... other than that overall, the game is good.",Negative
"Fun game, but it only works on the first launch after install. If I close the game and try to re-open it, it just opens a black screen then crashes. Only fix is to reinstall but then it only runs once. Switched to PC to actually try the game and it's fun, until you hit the f2p dropoff.",Negative
"4 to 1 star. I was happy to be able to play 1.0 but then in 1.1 I kept getting error 1001 or something like that and can't get in. I deleted the game and missed so much events and today I download back, it is still the same. I'm speechless. It was my pride and joy and now I'm just sad and depressed. I'm crying",Negative
"Great graphics but after 100+ times watching animation, I think add option to skip animation on the setting would be great. 3 stars from various of stuck bug though the game.",Negative
I am have a wonderful time playing the game but there is ine issue no matter how much I change the graphics quality my game surrounding became pixelated and the map just disappears i hope this gets fixed and i very much recommend the game if you're looking for a new game to play,Positive
"The devs need to smoothen it out a bit, but overall an amazing game! This game's storyline focuses deeply into astronomical ideas which are quite informative but paired with funny humour; it's characters all loveable. Can't wait for the next updates coming up-- ‚òÜMay this journey lead us starward! ‚òÜ",Positive
"So far, really excited about this game. I love turn-based RPGs (like Final Fantasy and other classics) and I'm excited to see the new characters and worlds! One of my favorite games is Star Ocean, so it gives me those vibes.",Positive
I'm at Trailblazer level 21 and am loving it so far ^^ especially the main character's humorous dialog options and how the characters interact. Pom-pom is also the best and cutest lil bean to ever exist Edit; when is the MC going to get a room on the Express? That would be awesome (Trailblazer lvl at 34 now) Also having trouble logging into the game sadly error 1001_3 (my genshin impact runs nicely on my ps4 connected to the same wifi. I've tried rebooting the router as well with no effect),Positive
"Great game, story, characters, world building, music and voice acting. Game is fun, and retains the same easy to understand menu systems as Genshin while being easier to enjoy on mobile since its turn based and not mechanically intensive for the player. You can enjoy the game fully as a F2P player not spending anything. It even feels rewarding (unlike gacha games from other developers). Mihoyo are the best in the gacha genre at getting the experience to feel rewarding and worthwhile for all!",Positive
"Funny how Google is smart enough to create their own AI and web browser, but don't have the intelligence to tell that if I rate an app 1 star, I'm not interested in downloading it. It STILL comes up in ""Suggested for you"", even though I rated it 1 star. Also, how is this app ""related"" to others? E.G. Bouncemasters has the theme Arcade, and apparently this is ""related"" despite not having the arcade theme. Google, your app store is completely broken.",Negative
"Uuuh overall good game and graphic i like it, and for just info for other who read review its turnbase rpg game so dont expect it look like genshin or hinkai impact. Story are good and gameplay is easy. But ucant skip the story its to much talk for people like me who cant play everytime. That why -1 star from me caus ei need to clik everytime they spoke or wait for they end the conversation with auto.",Positive
"Best game ever. As someone who love older FF series, this game is a godsend. A little bit simpler, but fair enough for a gacha game. Superb storywise. Just wishing that scaling for relic/trace mat drops will be increased a little bit.",Positive
"Good game, but swarm content is just ridiculously hard until the point it made you question what's wrong with your max leveled team. Make it a little bit easier and maybe it will become more enjoyable to play. Thanks.",Negative
I like it but I really wish you could do coop and also chat with friends I think more people would play for that purpose overall I like everything the design the story and characters.,Positive
I have seen many people suggesting this game it's actually a good game the only issue is the lag on mobile yes I'm this wasn't on my phone since I can play genshin I oact just fine but this game who only consume 15 gb of my storage keep lagging so the walls are glitching even the characters is glitching please fix this problem,Negative
"I'm really enjoying the game, the story and characters are great so far. Yes, it's turn based but it handles that mechanic well, in my opinion. Looking forward to more!",Positive
"This game I can not rate yet bc as soon as I logged on, my phone started warming up quite fast, so the cutscenes were very laggy and the music and voice lines were very distorted ill change my review if I get to play the game properly",Negative
"Overall a fantastic game so far. Hands down. Although, I just encountered cluttering sounds every cutscenes, it hugely ruins the experience so i hope the admins get to fix this! :D",Positive
"Great game, love the graphics and since I'm used to playing turn based games I certainly don't mind it, although do keep in mind, this game gives a better performance on newer phones/PCs/laptops etc. Also love the Genshin and Honkai Impact 3rd Easter eggs :))",Positive
"The game us absolutely amazing!! The storyline is perfect, the art stile and quality of the game is top teir! I love all the different stories and puzzles!!",Positive
"favorite game!! i love the way the fighting system works, the music is great, same for the character. the art is pretty and the plot seems interesting, this game also made me download genshin impact.",Positive
"I love the game so much but the game is very laggy on my phone, I can play genshin impact without it lagging but when I play hsr it lags like on 1fps, I have a good ram and storage but I don't know how to fix it, it isn't just a normal lag it's really freezing my game, please fix it I really love this game:(",Negative
"Finally, a turn based game with great graphics that can play smoothly on my phone. Really love the character, lore, details, and combat so far.",Positive
"Stuck on loading screen with train image...duh Edit : after several trying. I able to update and play. The game actually is good, but its just not for me, sorry And, non skip able story is suck",Negative
"Im giving this a one star review simply because after a few days of running normally it doesnt start anymore, ive tried reinstalling, restarting my phone and everything. It doesnt even show the hoyoverse logo, just a black screen. I was looking forward to playing it but alas its broken...",Negative
Great game + nice ost during bosses fight. New players no fret on if you're unable to do the ongoing events and unable to do due to levels. The old events will be still around and can be done whenever you're ready n get rewards too.,Positive
Yes why didn't I just put a 5 star? cause this/the download all resources is so freaking long like this took me 2 days to download all resources. By the way this can carry a useless phone like my itel a70. Yes you think this cannot carry heavy games? By the way I love this game when high graphics. This gets my battery died tho,Positive
"There are so many BUGS! When i change the graphics settings, everything turns white! Not even restarting the app can fix it! There's also a problem where you cannot attach at all!",Negative
"Great game, mechanics are very similar to Persona series so I recommend this game for people that liked Persona. Graphics are beautiful, also UIs! The other thing that boders me is how hard it is to get a 5 star unless you're not a whale (a person who spends so much money on games).",Positive
"There is no controller support. That is all I have say. Playing this with a controller would be the most comfortable and easier to way to play, every android game that has controller support is a better product for it. And it's a shame, game ran alright, looks nice but is unplayable for me without a controller.",Negative
I love the game! I rated it 4 stars because the cut scenes are really laggy but the dialogue is just fine so it's no that big of a problem it runs smoothly for me too! :),Positive
"A great free to play turn based combat game. Only downside is the predatory spending model, but if you just play everyday you can get a few of the characters you want.",Positive
"It is good for now, I cannot give 5 star since it's just new. So far, I like it because it is not very hands on to play so I can do some chores while farming for relics or materials since it has an auto attack feature.",Positive
Amazing! Beautiful! Hope there is romance between Mc and Dan Heng (I love him) . Can't wait for more stories!! However it cost to much to try and get more characters and I hate how there isn't a separate one for the cards. Also can we dress up mcs? Idk why but that'd be nice. For like certain things.,Positive
It's the best gatcha game right now better than every other game. The game is very friendly to free to play players as long as you are patient. The story is amazing with great characters world building and music.,Positive
Before the 1.1 update my game were smooth no bugs and no glitches But for some reason on 1.1 update the floor and the wall keep dissappearing and appearing. Also the train in main menu got cut in half I hope you could fix this bug for us all,Negative
Really Great Game.the story is immersive and has really enjoyable characters. The Game modes and the events are great. The developers are doing a great in adding quality of life features with every new update. The Game is free to play friendly even though it's a gacha game and you can clear all the contents in the game free characters.,Positive
The game keeps crashing,Negative
"Leaving a neutral 3-star since this is as much as issue with google playstore as it is the app itself: how much space do I really need? Clearly, the listed 136mb is just a loader, but I'm not gonna wait through a massive download (only one? one of many?) to figure out what y'all could've just stated clearly anywhere on the app page itself.",Negative
everything is good and i love it so much it become my fav game now but can you fix the drops rate for cavern of corrosion bcus why do i keep getting one yellow drop at level IV??? it's already hard to get good relics and wasted so much fuels bcus of the bad drops rate.,Negative
"Game doesn't require a lot of grinding/time. Has nice dialogue, story, and music. Turn based style combat is great. Really loving it so far.",Positive
"Dialogue clicker 2023. Falling asleep waiting for any gameplay. The ""game"" so far has just been story after story. You talk to characters you don't need to and have to just keep tapping. Will change the review if it gets better but there are better games (even from this company) Changing 2 stars to 1 star. I'm a few hours in now and all you do is meet new characters you need to keep talking to. Stupid waste of time Edited: Fine now. Opposite problem. No content",Negative
"You wanna know what I dislike the most about Genshin and this game too? The energy system, that is why I will stop playing it anymore. You wanna level or upgrade your other characters/weapons/items, you just can't because of this stupid energy system. The end game is just utterly boooooring AF, spending your precious energy on items with garbage stats.",Negative
Very fun but enemies can be hard to eliminate,Positive
It's my first turn-based strategy game in awhile so far I'm liking it when the story seems interesting however when I don't like is that I can't exit the game right quick come back and it just crash is it says I have to restart,Positive
"To be honest it's a good game but it has its own issues, when I opened the game half of the train was gone. And when I got into the game itself everything was glitchy from objects to the enemies itself.",Negative
"Super fun RPG, travel from world to world solving problems! Really varied puzzles and events, and some hilariously off the wall writing.",Positive
10/10 great story and animation keeps getting better,Positive
Star rail is an amazing game love all the references from the past games of hoyo an just the memes lying around it really makes the game hilarious while also having a good story an gameplay if you like games like persona or pokemon that utilize strategy / turn based then I highly recommend but if you came here off tik tok for a gensjin killer the games are two different world apart do not come here with the intention of another genshin you will be disappointed star rail is it's own masterpiece!,Positive
"I don't know what y'all talking Abt but there is no issues whatsoever y'all are trippin maybe get the device suited for the game and the internet it doesn't matter if u have high storage it's the Ram of your device, in any case the game is great I got addicted to it because it's so fun I'm looking forward on future updatesss, the story is so good too, graphics is so satisfying (mommy kafka I love you) I love the characters.",Positive
"nice graphics and characters, but too much dialogue for me and boring gameplay :D im sticking with genshin edit: tried this game again since genshin is ded, I finally reached penacony and everything is more fun. There is more mini games and very f2p friendly. I like how everything has voice acting and the story is not generic and very deep. from 1/5 star to 4/5 :3",Positive
"1. Good graphics/realistic 2.A lot of characters 3.Long download 4.some bosses are hard that u need to kill to move on 5.Everyone love this but some don't because of 20GB needed just for resources 6.Good Game/recommended if u play in PC 7.U better be using your own phone because ur parents gonna whoop u after seeing that 20GB 8.Very Good Game if ur at school to spend time at launch 9.No more lame boring homework 10.Ez to play (WALK, ATTACK, ENCCHANT, WIN) that's all the step 11. Th√§ts √§ll GG",Positive
"Can we Please have An Option to Increase or decrease Equilibrium Level Incase the Story Bosses are Element Specific and We are a new player? Cause Last Aventurine Boss was pretty Tough to Clear and I am stuck on 2.1 story ever since, because I lost on acheron's banner. Also what's worse is, Main event has limited rewards tied to completion of Story Quest, which Sucks. Imagine, you lose certain Time gated Rewards just because Dev's didn't account that not everyone is day one Player",Negative
Love your game BUT I want to suggest that can you make this app's storage lower? Like what you did to genshin (able to delete finished quest and stuff) it kills me seeing 28gb storage of this on my phone this game ain't even in half of the whole storyline and can you compress your cutscenes files and mouse game thingy in penacony too for potato phone mobile players like me???? I mean I'm sorry I have potato phone cause I'm poor but plss it's Soo laggy üòì thanks hope you see this ü´∂ü´∂ü´∂,Negative
I love this app. Although the resources take a while to load. So I just got to play the tutorial. But I love the characters especially Kafka and Den Hang. I have one request tho please make the resources loading screen faster.,Positive
"Great Turnbase game that you won't find any better than this one,Gacha is good with character that have stories deeply connected to the player character design is astonishing!. And I love this game so much, Hopefully that I can play this game till I die in 1000 years later on or even in another life.",Positive
"""Honkai: Star Rail"" is a masterpiece in the realm of mobile and PC gaming, deserving every bit of a five-star rating. This game, developed by miHoYo, excels in all aspects, from its stunning visuals to its engaging gameplay and intricate storyline.",Positive
"I love the futuristic vibe this game have, but I really don't understand the combat system, it feels like a chess tournament instead of a gencha video game and I hate the fact that enemies could deal damage to you",Positive
"All feature are excellent., 1 problem is when you trying to login into another account ""To many requests"" appears. Thats annoying., why? Almost 3days can't login",Negative
"Can't play it on mobile. Game crashes on login. Before this update I could still enter even with the numerous log in errors, now it just force close. Since my PC is dead I truly can't play it anymore, wasn't even able to start the event ü•≤",Negative
Look it's a great game.well made. Grabbed me at the beggining.uninsyalled when they decide to throw 18506 mb at u which is all my storage.game isn't worth my phone crashing. If it was more accessible to users with 60 gb then sure...,Negative
Love this game but please do optimize the game for Android high-end Exynos users. We still a bit lagging especially during cinematic cut scenes. It's terrible.,Positive
"Very good storyline but the gameplay and events are bland, recycled and does not bring anything new even though its hoyoverse we are talking about... Hope that changes in the 6th anniversary..",Negative
"It's good but I have a problem, everything else is loading expect for the map, it only shows it some cut scenes, I've tried fixing it but it still won't show :¬∞",Positive
I was able to download it and play but then it grabbed an extra gig of memory making it over 4 gig without any gaming data. It was a beautiful game but it is meant for a console,Negative
This is my first turn based game before this game I didn't like turn based but this game changed my perspective it has Good story the characters are top tier and very free to play friendly.,Positive
"Dear developer, i hope u can add new feature where i can change mc gender not from the beginning, but during the journey too, i had mistakenly pick wrong gender and i cant change it back :'( i dont want to hassle myself play at the beginning again, im already at end game content. hope u notice my review",Positive
"Breathtaking graphics, engaging story, standout OSTs, captivating character design, and a meticulously crafted turn-based gameplay experience. Good job Hoyoverse!",Positive
I LOVE THIS GAME!! üì¢üì¢üì¢ literally the story is EXTREMELY GOOD AND THRILLING. You should totally give this game a try!! The characters are so interesting and have personality too! Especially the MC/trailblazer,Positive
The game is amazing but there is no way to back out of dialogue once you start it. I even uninstalled and reinstalled it and it still put me in the dialogue.,Negative
"Amazing storylines, visuals and soundtracks, great humor, deep gameplay system without overwhelming UI, plenty of rewards.",Positive
"Its amazing omg, so beginner and f2p friendly, they basically give u 2 free five star characters, the story is amazing, the dialog is really funny, it doesn't take itself too seriously which is nice, they have these cute interactions with Pompom, its really cute, I highly recommend, it doesn't get boring at all, there's alot to do 5 stars well deserved",Positive
Awesome experience and loveable characters. Quests can have serious and dark themes but overall I found them to be enjoyable.,Positive
"Turn-based RPG, unique and lovable characters, interesting storyline, and space exploration! I couldn't ask for more. Hoyoverse did a spectacular job again! Keep it up!",Positive
"Please, make the game less storage heavy. I can't play or enjoy it when it takes up more space than I have on my phone! I want to play and purchase packages but I can't even fit the dang game!!",Negative
"At the start like every game you feel overwhelmed by the amount of content but after a week you done it all and start to see the genshin grind to show up login do daily, 4 relics runs and log out Sorry i will not waste 2 yeaes waiting for end-game like genshin for nothing This is a solo game if you enjoy the story just login once a year for the new planete.",Negative
"Gameplay is fine, the 20 ""free"" pulls aren't really good (you get useless loot from it too.) I shouldn't have to gacha for loot. Also, if it's turn based, make the progression linear and not p2w. Lots of server issues to boot. Drop rates are so bad, that I'm laughing while writing this. Don't download this game. Just a waste of time. There goes 30 mins of my life I'll never get back. ü•± Edit: I uninstalled. I'd rather play a real game, like Final Fantasy or the Persona Series. Lol.",Negative
"Never running smooth in mid-end device, require high-end device as genshin. It's very much stuttering and everything loading slow. (SD680-Android 11-4/64) Note : Game full size 21Gb+",Negative
So called the Tech Otaku will never save the world. The game only tells me the power of money. It sells 3d models and that's all. The original Mihoyo long gone. A good game makes people think more but not pay more.,Negative
Love the game so far.. however as someone who not play any other hoyo game.. i find the 50 50 summon is quite annoying and heartbreaking thing.. cause jade are not easy resources to get as the game progress foward.. really hope for much better system or make jade a little easier to get,Positive
Cool game. Made me learn about turn base for a bit but nothing too fancy. Characters are abundant with fun mechanics to deal damage. Your typical Hoyoverse game.,Positive
"The latest update of the game is unstable. After the update, the game often just stopped working, freezing on one frame and not changing in any way, and in general, the performance and comort of the game decreased due to overheating of the phone after just entering the game. I'm waiting for further updates. I will download this game when it is available to play",Positive
"They add some few things like in boss fight most player are struggling for how hard a boss is like Aventurine, Sam, etc. They should add something like you can use other people's character for support or players can fight them in low like genshin impact.",Negative
"This game has its flaws, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a blast playing this. The music, voices, animation, and combat are top-tier. I can tell that a lot of time and love was put into this game, and I look forward to seeing this game grow as big as Hoyoverse's other games!",Positive
Awful. The turn based combat is the worse. I like turn based games but somehow this game makes it bad. The only good thing about this game is the characters but the story is awful.,Negative
"I have a LOT of time in this game and I do enjoy it. But I really don't know why they put it on the playstore, it takes up over 75% of my total storage of 64gb and that's just ridiculous for a mobile game.",Negative
"Very difficult to play on the cellphone. Takes a long time to load everything e begin to play. I tried a few times, but without success. I gave up and deleted it.",Negative
"Game is good, but customer service is terrible. ""I have my email and password"" but cannot access my account as it says ""Too many request, please try again later. After many days of trying still the same. Contact customer service only to be turn down. Here is my rating on your feedback. Will remove once resolved.",Negative
The game is very excellent indeed but I had to get an update which took more than an hour to load the game and it was only at 40% percent when I came back. I am not keeping my phone on that long.,Negative
"This game is great,but the problem is the loading entrance screen when you want to register is soooo low. It almost took 12 hours to finish loading, and my Internet was destroyed...üôÑüò≠",Positive
"I'm getting tired of seeing this ad it takes too much storage, and it won't even start. Maybe it's only recommended for PC and really good phones only",Negative
"I didnt even get to play! And the loading takes sooo slow for nothing. After it loads ( which takes a long time ) it says "" sorry cant connect please try again later "" so i tried the next day and it said the same thing!",Negative
"One star, first of all I wanted to come back to play honkai/hsr i tried two of my accounts but the game resetted now I need my savings back it keeps going back at the beginning of the first start of the game and it's really annoying.!",Negative
I got to level 50 after two to three months of playing and buying a few add ons. Then I didn't play for two or three weeks and literally all my progress is gone. This game is a waste of time.,Negative
"Hi. Almost 5 star but for me it's only 4 because of when i screen recording or live streaming there's pixel problem , everytime i live stream it's like a television with no channel like. Please help fix that bug for android i dont. Know if I'm the only one experience it. If you reply I'll kidly send my screen record or that bug that I'm talking about",Positive
I couldn't even play this game is terrible in the beggining it asks u to put ur email in and it send a verification code then when I tired to go to my email to check the code as I went back to the game it resets.terrible game.,Negative
"bruh my email was correct but i had no password üòë ""i went to the forgot password page"" typed my email and completed the puzzle but heres what it had to say: ""sorry,couldnt find account"" LIKE WHAT YOU MEAN BRO guys please give this game a one star review (note from future me:same thing happened with genshin impact)",Negative
2 stars.Two Reasons.Grindding for characters takes too long and getting the currency its like little.I had fun when i started but holy hell the story is awesome and cutscene but the grind aint fun.Other Hoyoverse games Is fun like genshin for example because you can dodge in this game u cant.For Beginners u are prob gonna struggle because without heals u are basically dead.Thats my review.,Negative
"Never played any of the older Honkai games this is the only Honkai game I really played. I really like it I like March 7, Astra, mommy Himeko and Stella. I love the turn-based mechanics I like it better than Genshin Impacts direct combat system. The story is ok, seems a bit corny and lighthearted that's not a bad thing.",Positive
I mean like I love the game its great over all but it took up ALL of my storage to where i couldnt even do basic things on my phone and i had 150 GB of storage!! And i have like 5 other games and mostly apps thats INSANE!!,Negative
"Overall, hsr is a great game, nice graphics and cool character designs but I really wish that we could join other people's world too.",Positive
"I played on a binded account many months ago and have been trying to log back in to no avail. I was hoping to have this problem resolved. Apart from that, it's a wonderful game. Please help",Negative
Game is good I spent a lot of time into this game but ever since these high hp bosses came out it's literally so impossible to get pass them and I've been stuck on sam since that thing was released like making bosses very difficult does not make the game anymore fun it's just to frustrating,Negative
"Recently I've deleted honkai star rail because I needed the storage. Now when i redownload it, I log in to my account, but it's all refreshed and it restarted. I'm really sad about this, any idea how to get my account back?",Positive
"I need help! I would have given this game five stars, because it's great, but it won't let me log in to my account. I need help! I love this game so much! I've written customer service multiple times, but no one has ever responded.",Negative
"for quite sometime now, I've been getting an error called ""1000_0"". i can't play the game and that just makes me feel all my emotions coming out, so please fix thisü•∫",Negative
"It's my favorite game of the whole time. The rewards are very good, far better than genshin impact the event are very fun to play. Best turn based game that I have played in my life.",Positive
IMPROVE AUTO COMBAT AI. very inefficient,Negative
Really like this game and the rng can be really bad. But it takes up ways too much space around 30GB on my phone and I just can't play this anymore.,Negative
"New update and new character getting good, hope there will be more other characters from expy other hoyoverse. So far the battle and story is nice and fun, good work and keep up nice updates",Positive
"So i downloaded it the day it came out and had it for a week? I think. The reason i deleated it was because i had it on liw graphics and it was still frying my phone. But great game, just better for pc, I've never played it on pc cuz i don't have one.",Positive
"Great design, fluid character movement, game works smoothly on my device. The game itself is amazing, good storyline, I've found myself playing for half a day straight, I highly recommend anyone to play this!",Positive
"greedy gacha system, awful powercreep, atrocious and blatantly rigged relic system, extremely tedious combat system, boring story with obscenely long unskippable cutscenes, tedious events with mediocre rewards, avoid this for your own sake, the only postive reviews are bots and people who played the game for less than a month.",Negative
"One of the best games I played in my life, the story is interesting even the banter between characters! No issues whatsoever I'm fine with everything in the game.",Positive
"Extremely disappointing sequel to Honkai. It has the same interface as Genshin basically, and it's turn-based, which for me is boring. I thought games were supposed to take a step forward as new releases drop. Honkai Impact 3 was Mihoyo's peak game and after that came Genshin, which was just an open-world with a waste-of-time story and incredibly bad rng. Now it's this turn-based bs Star Rail that regresses. The only faithful part of Star Rail to HI3 is lore.",Negative
It's a good game. I also play Genshin Imapact but this didn't disappoint me at all. Just that if the fighting style was more freely done like GENSHIN IMPACT it would be even more nice.,Positive
The game dialogues are what keep me going. It's concise yet very fun since the lines are very witty. I also like that there are so many easter eggs and the path you'll have depends on your choices. Some even have permanent effect which is so cool.,Positive
"The gameplay itself is relatively simple and enjoyable. The monetization however, is completely atrocious and vastly overvalues what you actually get like most gachas. It's 2.66$ for a single pull, not counting ""first time buy"" bonuses. The pity 5 star, which only has a 50% chance to be the banner character, is guaranteed within 90 pulls (=240$). You can play it and have fun, but don't expect to actually be able to get characters you want.",Negative
"I love star rail, though please make it compatible on my phone samsung A8. It's stuck on the loading screen, even though it has worked before, but ever since the update, it was stuck there.",Negative
Lower the storage and then I'll consider playing it. On phone HD resources took several gigabytes. Without HD the game looks ugly as hell.,Negative
"This is the best game that I have ever player (I've played dokkan battle). Seriously this game is absolutely incredible, the artstyle, the music and the character design! This is a game dev team that cares deeply about their community and the gameplay. I would heavily recommend this game to any RPG Fans.",Positive
"Amazing game!! Very good characters, intriguing storyline, entertaining combat style with great animations Also playable without paying a cent",Positive
"The game doesn't get past the start screen, all that happens is that the screen turns black apparently because the cutscene wont play",Negative
It's a good game that deserves 5 star in every aspect minus the power balancing between the characters and blatant favorism towards the female characters that discourages me from playing.,Negative
"I love the storyline and the graphics, unfortunately, I cannot keep the game due to the mass of storage it needs.",Negative
"Played since day 1 release. Just finished 2.3. The game has got its ups and downs. When it's up, it's really great. I don't think there is any comparable games on the market.",Positive
"Really enjoyed playing honkai starrail and the story line was decent enough to keep me entertained, however this game is no longer compatible on my chrome for some reason and I can no longer play..... Which is devastating to me especially since Blade comes out the moment I can't play.",Negative
"Characters are power crept way too fast. Today's best is tomorrow's second, third and so on. Too much pressure to pull for new characters. Can't keep up.",Negative
Too much dialogues. Some stretching over 30 minutes and there's no skip feature. Story quests are literally story lines from character conversations that you have to read. Too much talking and little action. They could have opted for cut scenes instead of making you click for responses that does not make any difference to the story.,Negative
"Great game, parade of places to go, however it's a memory hog and doesn't let you select which drive to store it in. Make sure it's the only game on your phone",Negative
"Honestly an amazing game Music - 10/10 Graphics - 8/10 Animation - 9/10 Story - 10/10 Gambling Incentive - 11/10 Do play if u like turn based games, just dont complain about the gacha (its optional if ur good at the game)",Positive
"It's so nice! I love the gameplay, I know you it's normal to have bugs since the game is it's baby form but I'm rooting for you guys! ‚ù£Ô∏è Keep up the good work!",Positive
"I've been playing since release tho I lost my first ACC but this game has great graphics, designs and story and every character is deep and well written:D",Positive
"Great story and characters, lots of varied and fun content. Grindy, but has autoplay. Gacha with pity that carries over. By far the best HoyoVerse game.",Positive
"Being an F2P player has never been easier. They throw so much free stuff at you, so much premium currency with each event. The maximum you need to spend is $5/month and play every day to have an OP team Holy smokes, this game file is so big. 100GB Mobile game?!?! 90% of all phones have 128GB storage, max",Negative
"They really need to trend down the gigabyte space that it requires to play this game. I had uninstall it till it required less space on mobile. Till then, it a 1 star from me.",Negative
"Great gameplay, great story, great characters, great rewards, a lot of love from the devs, great grphics, yk every thing you could want from a game, in contrast with a certain game of the same company that doesn't get nearly the same love lmao",Positive
"Honkai StarRail is like hopping on a cosmic rollercoaster piloted by an overly caffeinated space hamster. The plot twists harder than a pretzel at a carnival, and the characters are so quirky they could form their own sitcom. The battles? Think of laser light shows crossed with a fever dream. It's chaotic, hilarious, and somehow still makes sense‚Äîjust don't ask me how!",Positive
"the most not free to play experience in a gacha game ever the pressure to build every single team, and pulling for every single 5 star is so strong in this game, and the fact that every new 5 star is just so much better than every released before them sucks so much",Negative
The game is good and all but the add i saw the game from said it was giving 80 free pulls and I didn't get any free pull but I downloaded the all from the add so I have to remove 2 stars for it,Negative
The game is fantastic. I'm only leaving a 1 star till I win a 50/50 cos the pity system in this game is a scam...until it one day proves me otherwise. Anyway hope you're having a wonderful,Negative
I heard good reviews about the game and decided to try it out but when all the needed data fully loaded I was stuck at the loading page you know the one with the train and I really want to try it out please help me,Negative
"Login Error Occurred every opening the game, it happen once per login, but its annoying, hope it fixed soon, Overall Great. Note: i dont have internet issue, this is like bug or glitch, definitely not problem from me.",Negative
"Sunday playable and me getting E6 Gallagher and Misha when (game is good btw, recommend it if you like silly and serious type of games, I don't recommend it if you don't like turn based games)",Positive
Great Game! Only Downside is it's 10GB right now and I unfortunately only have a 64GB phone half of the storage is already eaten away by system updates and I can't delete family photos on the phone unfortunately other than the space issue great game would recommend!,Positive
"Absolutely adore this game. However, if we don't get the good ending at Penacony, we will riot. Right after we have finished crying. Edit: Good ending acquired!",Positive
"Absolutely amazing , the story is a masterpiece, the game play is fun , + they are so generous with the rewards and the events are so fun",Positive
"This is the best roleplay game I ever played but there are some things that make me don't play this game, I can't open the app, so I hope you can fix that part, thank you",Positive
"The cutscenes skip and grind along, to the point where it made no sense at all. However they're loading these scenes, it's not very efficient. Rip",Negative
It's a beautiful looking app but it didn't work for me,Negative
I can't even play. 17 gigs? REALLY? Do you really need 17 gigabytes of storage to play the mobile version of this game? Idc that it's free when it takes up so much of my storage.,Negative
The game is great my experience with this game is the best RPG The game played so far this year the graphics the game player. It's easy to navigate and complete missions.,Positive
"Overall an amazing experience! Only issue I have is why UK price is more expensive than in Genshin, making it more expensive than US pricing too. ¬£100 is definitely too much to top up without even being guaranteed a 5* out of it",Positive
"Story is great and will only get better, graphics are good. And the game doesn't require alot of time per day, you can auto all 240 Stamina very quickly and get your daily premium currency. And it doesn't punish you very hard for not logging in constantly as your Stamina will be converted in a 3:1 ratio as reserved stamina. You can also get most limited characters you want as long as you skip characters you're not interested in.",Positive
An excellent turn based RPG experience that is playable without being forced into gatcha. They do award alot of currency for free rolls with 2 major flaws; The first issue is limited chars which cannot be rolled for outside of event banners and the fact that the base banner is... Bad to mid with the exception of 1 meta char. The second issue is the amount of currency you get for free is essentially enough for 1 guaranteed pull per month (50/50 W/L) but we get 2 event chars per month.,Positive
"I played genshin to this, it feels like an upgrade especially on the character design and dialogue. I love it. Make the story even more intense! Everyone enjoys a good drama",Positive
"Pretty good game, esp for a mobile game. Seems you can play FTP and it's still just as good. Kind of a throw back to FF turn based play. The graphics are pretty decent as well.",Positive
Why i cant login ??? My internet is normal as always but why i cant login ? Please fix it hoyo and even i cant login on my genshin impact T_T + discord,Negative
"Very good game, but please PLEASE ADD SERVAL CONCERT WHERE ROBIN VISITS AND THE STAGE IS SET INFRONT OF QLIPOTH FORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Positive
"Another great game from HOYOVERSE. Pretty great the graphics and story are the best. Endgame IMO is to much, but they're still great the recent SWARM was difficult aswell, although I won't play it much cause I'm busy now.",Positive
The messages from the characters are the best more of that. Also got Seele and Bronya so only gonna save for their reruns and the other two support characters for them. Looking forward to more content.,Positive
"I like the premise of the game, final fantasy play style. The problem is the game constantly crashes and you have to replay to the last save point. My phone is a galaxy 21 Ultra, not the problem.",Negative
Its to laggy and i cant get into the game,Negative
I like the game a lot and so much entertaining.. and can i have favor? Can you fix the bug i think in android or maybe in my device infinix note 12 pro 5g in the main story continues vid the voice of the characters is more like a robot and the characters is getting slowmo.. thank you in advance ü´∂,Positive
"I am so amazed!!! The technology used to develop this game is superb this is the game I am looking for! A lobby you can roam, a spacious and cute room with accessible books etc (one you can sleep or sit would be nice as well!), COOL 3D world that fits the eye its like real!! So fun to talk to them~ Lastly, game mechanics is so easy to understand the developer really made it concise and awesome! DONT LISTEN TO ENTITLED PPL WHO GAVE 1 STAR, THEY LOVE TO COMPARE AND DEMAND THINGS SO JUST ENJOY~‚ú®",Positive
"I love this game it's fun and fresh from the other game this company has made, but when it use to run smoothly and never crash in me, now it bearly runs and I can't even go into one battle without it crashing yet I can play genshin fine and that a bigger game this this one.",Negative
"Well developed! I can't complain about any aspect. The story is great, as well as the game play. Turn based rpg with a slight action twist. Hit the top of my Playlist by far! Really fun game. I can't wait for more.",Positive
"This game is tragic. The characters have no sense of unity or continuity amongst them. It all seems like left over character designs that didn't make it into the other games. Which is sad because the characters are detailed and it's clear they put a lot of time into them. Not only that though, the auto battling system is honestly OBNOXIOUS. Learn how to play the battles with your own strategy because the auto battler literally kills you on purpose. Also the MC says noice and i wanna kms. ok bye",Negative
"Very good graphics, characters and the turn based system is amazing. However the let down is false announcements of free pulls and the p2w mechanics with pulls just like GI.",Negative
"So far it's miles better in terms of player experience compared to Genshin Impact. It's a game that respects the players time. Great visuals, music and voice acting. Story is so so.",Positive
"Hi. I have a hard time logging in because the game lags a lot when I tried to download its files in the game and suddenly want me to redownload again. I'm tired of this redownload in repeat, so please fix this soon.",Negative
It's a good game but whenever you're playing there will always kicked out randomly and it's getting worse it's the third day consecutively getting kicked and says login error over and over please fix this by the way it's Asia server I don't know about other server.,Negative
Ok so the game itself I enjoy. Equipment summon and level up stuff is similar to genshin. So easy to slide in and play. Not too happy with initial rates for acquiring legendary characters as I have yet to see one from limited summon. However you will get a random pull for one in the beginner summon. Like genshin a purple character when equipped properly and leveled seems to get you progress. So it's not a waste if you get a purple char. 4 star for poor rates on legendary,Positive
"My sister is literally so obsessed with a character on this game. She keeps mentioning the word ""Aventurine"" Every time I talk to her. She doesn't even talk to her own family members because of that Aventurine. Her room is filled with Aventurine merch. Please get rid of the blonde tall gambler. Still the game is good though",Negative
"Maybe its just me but having to download a game that is roughly the size of 2.5gigs, then have to sit through 16gigs of resourses just to be able to play is dumb. At least let me play while its downloading in background how other games especially mmo(blade&rings) can do just that.",Negative
Really enjoying the gameplay and story but only when I'm able to open the game. The majority of the time all I get is a black screen when trying to open the app. Please fix as I want to play your game.,Negative
"the game is amazing, its one of my all time favorite games. unfortunately, i cant play due to storage issues :(",Positive
This game is really good I don't usually like turn based games but the attack animation's for the bursts and the skills they look really nice and are very smooth if you like turn based games I extremely recommend this game.,Positive
"Nice game and good storyline, so for",Positive
It became more challenging but less rewarding,Positive
"Mobile friendly graphics and 3D models, story is nice with interactive and engaging storyline, characters and world build up is nice. Definitely looking forward to more future updates~!",Positive
"This is great game because it has great music, voice acting on each character and more. Also, you dont have to worry about 5* because you can get it for free if you pull 300 times and choose each 5* you want.",Positive
"the game was so good and i like how this game works. i even got bailu and she so cute, i like the characters design, its an amazing works and they deserve it. also it seem that its going to be lots of adventure and storyline to be when we playing it. so far the game is really really REALLY fun to play!!‚ú®üéâ",Positive
"Literally the best game in existence, no complaints whatsoever.",Positive
"the game crash a lot! fix the bugs. the game is overall good but the turn based system does not fulfill me, i like the genshin impact mechanism more. well for now just fix the bugs!",Positive
"Was having a great time with it and put in quite a few hours in my first couple days playing only to have it start up from the beginning on my latest boot up, even though it's tied to my Facebook account. Lame. I don't see a way to recover my progress...",Negative
"Very good game with interesting story, cool animations and with a lot of content",Positive
"The only reason why I downloaded this game was to play with my controller on my mobile device, something rather than the normal FPS shooter to play, I don't know if I've played far enough to even unlock the setting, but it doesn't look like that there's controller support. I'm using a PlayStation 4 controller. Please let me know if I'm doing anything wrong or need to complete the tutorial before I can do anything like that. I'm also planning on a pixel 7.",Negative
"i like this a little more than genshin. though it has a lot of bugs and glitches and such. i really like this battle system a lot. however, my data just kinda vanished one day and now i have to start all over again, so that sucks.",Negative
"its really decent for a game that has just been released. though the starting screen is always lagging everytime i open the game, everything else is perfectly fine.",Positive
"I hate this game, I never even get to the actual gameplay, and it just keeps staying at the login page. also, you need to stop putting ads as it it really annoying and frustrating. fix it now",Negative
"This game is AMAZING! but there is a problem. I need to know why my game is suddenly turning into white? I mean the background in the game? Before that happend, i'm just play the adjusment of the resolution and after that it became all white. Do you know how to fix it?",Positive
"I waited for this game to release because i wanted to play it. The problem is, everytime I try to play the game the message ""error code: 1001_3"" always pops up. I've tried uninstalling and installing the game again, and cleared data but it won't work. Hope you can fix this soon.",Negative
"[‚ÄºÔ∏èIF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY I SUGGEST WAITING TO GET THE GAME‚ÄºÔ∏è] It's a very good games and somewhat easy to understand, but there's a glitch where sometimes when I try a trial character there are a bunch of rainbow bright squares where I think textures and effects should be, I have videos and I'm afraid that if anyone who may have epilepsy plays it could get injured, luckily I'm not but I would suggest to attempt to fix this and if not at least put a epilepsy warning to help protect your players",Negative
"This is a great game, you're more generous here Hoyo, and I like the stories too. The characters design here is good too, and I like the characters physique here, semi-realistic but still look like anime characters.",Positive
The storyline and game play have been good so far but right not I'm stuck under the train and I can't get out. I don't know how this happened and I'd like to give the game 5 stars but I'm literally stuck right now Edit: I'm no longer stuff I love this game,Positive
"I love how this had me enjoying turn base. Very fun and interesting story, characters, and mechanics! Unfortunately I don't have enough space anymore, but I'll definitely be downloading it again once I get a better phone!",Positive
So far this game are good! Its have gacha system like genshin but i guess its better a little bit. Also the fighting style kinda interesting its very unique for me an open world and a strategy fighting style. I like it! Please keep it up and please give more rewardü§ó,Positive
It's so hard to earn Stellar jade. Resources is hard to acquire. Oh my! Giving me a headache.,Negative
Maybe if your registration process wasn't a problem I would give you a higher rating,Negative
"poorly optimized on mobile. on a good run, everything is smooth, on a bad run, it's totally unplayable. it's not a bad game, just needs more work for those playing on their phones.",Negative
Game? Definitely 10/10 or in this case 5/5 but the reason i gave it a 3 is because if you're phone is trash enough on v1.1 you will be stuck in the loading screen because of an error i dont know what happened because it was working fine in v1.0 now I can't really play it on my phone but on my laptop now.,Negative
"Could not defeat main boss, characters were unable to increase levels enough to beat the boss, nonway to gain materials for upgrading levels. Need more ways to upgrade levels, store has NOTHING IN THE WAY TO HELP.",Negative
"I will be honest,I really enjoyed soo much in this game.Turn base game is really ez and not wasting too much my time and energy on fighting just to show of my skill.The real ez to play games.The story is really good to... that's make it 8/10.It may become too repetitive in the future cuz the gamplay not that flexible,but... we'll see about thatüóø.",Positive
"it's honestly a very ""meh"" game. I saw the gameplay footage & was pretty underwhelmed. lo&behold it's worse than I thought. there's zero strategizing, it's all a ""bigger # wins"" autobattler. Story is uninspired, open world is desolate, & it really does nothing to set itself apart. normally I would give it a 3* but there's a lot of shills giving it undesrved 5* so I'm just balancing it.",Negative
"update: bugs have been slove after more than 96hrs, no compensation at all, lost 4days reward + energy. I'm even top up the money the day before the bugs happened, LOL 29lv facing very serious bugs, and I'm unable to continue to proceed at all! ( I have been stuck there for more than 96 hours. I lost all my mission and reward)",Negative
"I'm having a serious issue with this game, I genuinely adore playing it but for some reason the game started to lag and stutter which has never happened before. So I uninstalled it. However after doing so I cannot reinstall the game for some reason. I get a 13mb update and than the game just continues without letting me download the rest. I've tried waiting out but nothing has happened.",Negative
"Houkai Gakuen 2 (GGZ) x FF7 x Genshin. trailblazer's baseball bat reminded me of GGZ at beginning of story where Kiana picked bat to fight zombie. turn-based rpg, picking up items around, reminds me of old FF7. characters, organisation names, weapons are kinda from GGZ. thats nostalgia. character upgrade kinda like Genshin's. I enjoy the story richness as well.",Positive
Boring and slow tutorial. Seeing it's the same people from Genshin it's going to be impossible to level except with level up materials. You get xp from encounters but it's meaningless after a few levels.,Negative
"An okay game but terrible loading. It takes a minute to load the character screen, but in genshin it only takes a sec. Sometimes the game also crashes when it tries to load things",Negative
"For me this game reminds me of Turn based Console quality game. It has beautiful scenery, graphic. But the battle system also smooth. Interesting Char design.",Positive
"(Update) I installed this game again hoping to work but still unable to play, best game honestly for me but I can't play this game anymore. I already did all the way to play this game but there's no hope, hoping to find other turn-based game that would work to my phone also I like playing those browser games from honkai. PS: Genshin is working fine on me at 20-30 fps.",Negative
It is a storyline packed game with fantastic voice acting for Japanese and English great characters design its a turn based game so it's wonderful for on the go and it's 7gb in size which is way better than you think I highly recommend to give it a try,Positive
I haven't been this thoroughly entertained in a long time. The dialogue and character interactions in this game are off the charts and the environments are very pretty too. Overall my first few days of playing have been amazing.,Positive
"Played the Beta and i must say everything from the characters, voice, art, gameplay and story, all of has been amazing so far. Its noticeable that this is another Honkai game as it seems to get the love and attention it needs to continue being an amazing game. Im looking forward to the launch",Positive
"My only issue now in this game is that after some battle, it just turn into a black screen. the music is still playing but i can't do anything. my only solution is to restart the which i know I'll encounter the same problem in the future. fix pls",Negative
The animation and the dubbing is amazing. It really helps to submerge into the story. But the gameplay is rather boring.,Negative
"I love this game so much. It has amazing character designs, amazing gameplay if you are into turn-based combat, an amazing plot, and is easy to understand how to play.",Positive
"The game is fun so far but only downside is how mobile unfriendly it's graphics are. If you are a genshin player, compared to it, this games graphics can be cruel to you. I went by lowest and it still lags. I use the default one on genshin...",Negative
"This game is good like so good that i play it all day and it pretty easy for me to play but the thing is that it took so long for me to start the game, and when i start the game it said Error login 1001.3 and i was confused on why is this happening and i do the login for 25 time just to see the same thing error login that all i see. Pls fix the logins error",Negative
"Amazing game, It's a turn based kind of game (Kinda annoying because of that the develepors are the same as genshin and i'm a bit too used to games that dong take turns just attack) But, Thats only because i play genshin impact, If i didnt and i played this first, I'll be confused why genshin is NOT a turn based game anyways, I recommend you to download it because its fun, WARNING : You might be surprised about how much storage it takes",Positive
"Don't waste your time This is about as pointless a game as I've ever seen. The story is terrible, the characters aren't likeable, the voice acting is terrible, and the entire time it feels like you're playing to get to where the game actually starts. The turn action is bland and unoriginal, unsatisfying and clunky. I really wish I could take those 3 hours of my life back.",Negative
Though it's fun as heck but there's not much characters so the enemy's weakness is hard to counter for example i got yanqing I'm happy with him but because I got no imaginary it's hard to upgrade my equilibrium level so I'm gonna take a break for a few month or when I found interest in the game until then this game is 9/10,Positive
"I keep getting a log in problem. It ruins my experience but that's just it. Other than that frequent annoyance, this game is awesome. I look forward to it's future.",Positive
"Originally, I downloaded Honkai: Star Rail to support one of my favorite voice actors, Alejandro Saab/CyYu. However, in just 2 days, HSR has become much more. Like Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail has such a hold on me, my life, and it probably will control my wallet, too! XD Hoyoverse has outdone themselves once more with such a riveting tale executed in fantastic game play. I'm not usually a fan of Sci-Fi games and stories, but Star Rail is in a league above the rest. Amazing work!",Positive
"Not sure how f2p the game will become since I never got into Genshin Impact but so far you get a total of 80 pulls while playing the game. Though the rates suck and even if you do pull for the limited character it's 50/50 whether you get her at all, but beyond its fun and compared to the gachas I tried it looks like the Devs did put so effort in to this with the story ( what I seen so far) and small little details throughout.",Positive
"Honestly liking it more than Genshin right now (which is made by same company) I like the character's dynamic and the auto combat, the ult animations are very cool and they are pretty generous on giving free gacha pulls. I hope they keep updating Simulated Universe contents.",Positive
Its a great game but i think it needs some optimization I know its still in early stage so i hope it got optimized soon When i play the game my phone just become a nuclear reactor because of the processing But when i play honkai impact or genshin my phone is just fine even without cooler And im using high setting for both of them So im really surprised with how hot HSR make my phone,Negative
I've had so much fun playing during the first few weeks but i slowly ran out missions and chests and things to do. I really hope there's more end game content than just Simulated universe and Memory of chaos.,Negative
"A turn based strategy game that brings the inspiration of the trails series and the products of the honkai verse together, having not only an interesting story and amazing interactions what else is there to say other than this game is amazing.",Positive
"Horrible gacha rate and eventually, it will take a long time to get some good number of pulls without paying! Dont listen to those youtuber pulling with just a few $$ saying they got all good stuff! Mobiles games are now horrible for rates and giving them any money is just accepting this horrible system! Save your money and buy real good games instead",Negative
"Yet another amazing game from hoyoverse. Story is good(too soon to judge), combat is turn-based which is rare to nowdays but refreshing but it is good, world building is nice, music is insane like always from hoyo, characters design is awesome,",Positive
"Truly amazing! I wasn't sure if I would like the turn based gameplay, but it's really fun and all thr characters are amazing! The open world is beautiful for a turn based game and I now play this as much as I play genshin! Keep it up Hoyo!",Positive
Good solo game but there is no way to connect with other players. You can add friends and there is no chat function. Why do you even let ppl add you in the friend list if you cant even talk to them? It just doesn't make sense at all  Ö( ‡πëÔΩ•·∑Ñ÷äÔΩ•·∑Ö‡πë) É,Negative
"Octopah travellers with fancy graphic. What you will get: nice voice acting, flashy skills, ok music and story, terrible drop rate, generic game play, meta beats all just like other game. Need dupe or same grade to upgrade. Nothing is interesting to me. Sadly for all the hype.",Negative
"This game is so good love the character's and stories but there's something wrong on my graphics whenever I switched into low,midium, high, very high graphics everything turned into white pls fix this bug pls I really love this game üò≠ü•∫",Positive
It's a great game but there's this issue where textures are going pink and showing up as blocks. It makes the gameplay quite hard to enjoy since all I see are pink squares instead of effects,Positive
"Great game, but needs improvements for the combat in the long road, otherwise will become repetitive. The writing is really funny at times and overall is really enjoyable",Positive
"I was hoping for a playable experience, however, they do not allow y axis inversion for the camera. This means I get terribly motionsick if I attempt to look around.",Negative
"It's a turn based game, don't expect something of Genshin. Animations are as always top tier. Just like in Honkai 3 the cutscenes are beautiful, all characters have different personalities. Even the Mc can be sassy, nice or silly, it is up to you on how to chose your Dialoge options! And they speak a lot more than Mc genshin. This game is a mix of honkai 3 and genshin. You will find similarities of both games in HSR, BUT it is normal since it is the same game developer.",Positive
It's lagging so bad to the point where I can't even play.. please fix it. I also don't really like how the combat and fights take turns but overall the story and game in general is okay.,Negative
"Great game with nice graphics, story, both puzzles and action, quite f2p friendly. It used to hang a lot in the beginning but runs much more stable now.",Positive
"Story is boring and unskippable cutscenes is just too long, I'm expecting HSR bring something new for turn base type game, but it turns out almost the same as other generic turn base, which mostly just gonna dies in few weeks.",Negative
"Encountered a bug during simulation universe. E.g. Choosing blessing ""Failed to obtain information"" had to restart the game because I cant proceed to the next stage. Pls fix the glitches and bugs!",Negative
"I like waifus and husbandos. A game with compelling story, likeable characters, top tier world building, and banger OSTs. It's free to play, so it's up to you whether you want to be that person who goes yolo on every banner, the careful planner, or the gigawhale who has everyone maxed out. 10/10 will continue to support the game by buying packs and watching my awesome f2p luck lose every banner, game still hella good",Positive
"This game is great and all and in some cases, better than genshin impact but seriously.....the gacha rate is useless as garbage. I did 10√ó summons for seele 80 times and all I got was useless stuff. Same was the case with the another character gacha. Did 10x 70 times and didn't get anything. They just want to extract money from us yall. Punishing gray raven's gacha rate is reasonable, money makes it easy but without money, it's possible too. Uninstalled it.",Negative
"just updated the new update rn. doing that event quest then suddenly it glitched, it keeps glitching that it hurts my eyes, i tried restarting my phone but it's still not fixed;( wanna do the event to farm so please dix this,:(",Negative
"I really like the graphics of the game and what makes it unique is that it is a turn-based game, they really did a masterpiece game, this is my opinion and I've been playing this game since day 1 and I for real really liked the game, the difficulty of the game is balanced and I really like the story, and I can't wait for the next update. If you are reading this review, and you haven't downloaded it or tried it, thrn you should download and try it, I bet you will like the story, the graphics.",Positive
"Please note:I'm only reviewing the pc version of this game not the android version cuz it drains battery and use only if you really wanna do dailies in a hurry!now onto the actual review:better story,better content,turn based gameplay, actual humor and finally:better character designs than genshin impact. Also the graphics look gorgeous on pc and the soundtrack is just chefs kiss",Positive
The game wa good but there is a bug issue like the graphic change quality and the place was pure white after I change it on very low or low graphics is ok but there is a black thing object something please fix this problem. üôè,Negative
"Not enough content, otherwise I love this game. I understand it's new, but from the future update logs there seem to be no more adventure quests. Hope there's more storyline!",Positive
"I like the combat mechanics bc it feels more strategic than in the other games,the performance is very good too with smooth 60fps(galaxy s22)i had no problems with the gambling system (totally not bc i won seelie on 5050)Graphics are,ofc beautiful.The story is ok too.However this game has the same problems as in genshin impact: you will eventually have nothing to do in the game bc you have gotten all the content available rn and have to wait for months just to get more content again which sucks.",Negative
"Wonderful characters with great story! It's a turn based rpg. A lot of fun to play! Beautiful art style! Be warned this is also a gotcha, with how cool a lot of these characters are your wallet may be in peril.",Positive
"Very good game, as expected. But for some reason I have laggy music in cutscenes, also my phone crashes because of it so I spend more time trying to get my phone to work than actually playing.",Positive
Toooo much dialogue wayy too much. You get like 8 minutes of fighting then 13 minutes of dialogue which ruines the feel of the game for me. This game isn't for me but I'm sure if you enjoy solo play with story modes you'll like this. There's also no SKIP button for those who don't want the dialog.,Negative
Good game so far but in the recent updates in the loading screen i cant see the train then after that i cant see the wall or the buidings for some reason. I stoped playing this game for some time now and its still there. Please fix this i can barely play this game because of this bug üòî,Negative
"Quality is still top tier like all of their games, no crashes or bugs.. No inapp glitches/exploit too.. Game is turn based with a little tweak to not bore you, easy auto and battles are not difficult.. And what I like more are the devs that take players' feedback and actually implement it, unlike genshin devs.. I don't main the game but actually spend just to support the game I like",Positive
I'm a big fan of turn base games and usually for gacha games I skip story. The story is very enjoyable and humorous. It never really dragged on like genshin as a comparison. Very chill game with some mini boss difficulty that makes you strategize a bit and feels great to beat.,Positive
"Game is good, system is good , story quiet fast pace especially at Jarilo planet in which not much character development happen for npc where they suddenly agree to fight stellaron and face the perpetrator without much thought. The only thing I'm not satisfied is with my account luck on gacha, it's really terrible especially to lose on pity and get the wanted character at hard pity which around 80-90",Positive
"This game is really amazing! I love the gameplay of its turn based type the animation and effects is top notch, i've never seen such high quality on this kind of genre. Well done hoyoverse!üíñ",Positive
"It became instant 10/10, the music, jaw dropping graphics (personally i loved it) even if it is turn based, i didn't feel like it was turn based. Again i would say instant 10/10",Positive
"It's a great game, honestly. Love it. My previous problem was fixed. Anyway, I love the characters and the game play. Turn based games are new, but it's entertaining in a way I didn't think it could be.",Positive
"After playing for a long while I've seen about 80% dialogue and cutscenes and maybe 20% gameplay including running around the map. Maybe the honkai feels more like a game later on but right now it's a badly explained poorly animated, and most importantly boring show",Negative
"My device turns off every two minutes when I open hsr. Please, make an optimization, because graphics is so good. This turning off the only problem.",Negative
"It's not that good, it's just okay... As usual no skip button for long dialogues which makes the game boring, characters design are very good and cool except for the MC male version, as usual only the female gets the good design",Negative
"It was a amazing game, but after the update there are so many glitches, like the walls are keep disappearing and i had a hard time logging in,.please fix this.... (Sorry for my grammar)",Positive
"This game has got to be the best game i've ever played in a long time, like the content is endless, the characters are amazing, the lore is mind blowing, the plot is perfect and most importantly IT RESPECTS YOUR TIME",Positive
"Best turn base rpg game...great gameplay,fascinating story,superb character and artwork. It will be perfect game, if developer can make this game playale in potato android like minimize effect in battle. I have 6gb xiaomi..but still make my android burn with lowest setting. Thanks for your great work !",Positive
"Game keeps crashing, something about a global distribution error UPDATE: game works well now since whatever was taken care of, combat is nice, characters are generic, story seems pretty straight forward, we'll see what happens next",Positive
"the game keeps kicking me out whenever i try to open it,, i hope they fix this issue,, until then i think i'll uninstall it for the mean time and just wait for some time to let the developers stabilize the game more",Negative
"Great game, I haven't experienced any glitches. Story is well thought out. Only issue I'm having is keeping my team at a level to keep progressing. Highly recommended!",Positive
"5 stars, but there is no way to get jades(gacha currency) after you have finished the story,the side quests and looted all of the chests while there is no event going on; besides the level up rewards and outright buying them with real money(not considering the miniscule amount of gems u get from messages and achievements).",Positive
"advertisement promised 80 pulls. after jumping through a dozen hoops i recieved a total of 20 pulls. also not enough cute boys. as far as turn based rpgs goes the gameplay is extremely shallow. your party gets access to 1 basic attack, 1 skill, and 1 ult each. there is only one equipment slot available. this game has nothing to offer you other than whatever appeal spending money on a virtual slot machine for anime girls holds for you, and if that's what you're after there are better options.",Negative
The game is perfect just one problem (I understand it since it's newly open) sometime my game just froze for no reason or it just crash doesn't everytime though but if it's possible please fix this issue but otherwise this game is really good,Positive
"Either sells your email address to third parties including malware distributors or has had their data compromised and leaked. I know this because I create a unique email address for every game I play and don't reuse it anywhere, yet somehow I'm getting malicious spam on the one I gave here. I like the game; graphics are great. However data safety is not something I'm willing to trade for that.",Negative
"I love this game and play this almost religiously to the point I'm done with almost all of the side quests in this update, but it takes so many resources to use everything I can't increase my trailblazer level, I'm struggling to get any resources to level up my characters and I have no money to support my characters/skills or items to craft. I'm struggling to get things every day. Please help. I need a lot of Exp, money, and drops to sustain myself to get myself to a higher point.",Positive
"Better than Genshin, honestly. Music, graphics, characters, character designs, and locations are top tier. It's hard to believe this game is free to play :)",Positive
"Battle system needs a bit of change, for example breaking shield are not really matter during the battle. Maybe you can change that. Lastly, the gotcha rate is so freaking low man. 80pull and no ssr.",Positive
"A very great game, and generous too when it comes to handing out in-game rewards. Would reccomend to download if you are looking for a time-killer game that you would enjoy at the same time!",Positive
"Amazing polish, dialogue, story, ost, character and world design, memorable locations and story moment on top of a smooth take on turn based combat. Highly recommended if you can stomach gacha.",Positive
"Amazing, absolutely beautiful animation and graphics...... love the game.... although i have some problems... The loading screen lags alot and and The Fps is also Lagging even with the lowest graphics settings.... pls fix",Positive
"After the latest update, the express had lots of missing textures, games stutters even more than last time, and if I'm lucky to even get in, it crashes a few minutes after. Please fix this.",Negative
"I already lessened my expectations knowing it would be a turn-based game but honestly? It's really boring. The story isn't interesting, the gameplay isn't interesting, you'd be watching the same animation over and over. I kinda expected more knowing some elements of genshin would be incorporated but it's really just the art style. Idk. Not my cup of tea.",Negative
"After the latest update, the app keeps on crashing, specifically when I'm selecting characters. This is the first time I encountered this issue. Hope you will be able to fix it soon.",Negative
"Graphics is very amazing,, but it's kinda boring because the gameplay is quite not interesting,,, i thought i could play like old honkai that i can use my fingers to battle and do some strategies to defeat boss and mobs. I thought this game was like genshin and old honkai that you can explore the world.",Negative
"Great gameplay, wonderful art and visuals to match. The build up paces nicely and am looking forward to the progression of the storyline and banners ahead!",Positive
"everything that genshin could've been. the mc is humorous, the whole open world exploration has elements of humor and even horror and i like that a lot. the characters are fun and as a turn based game it's still quite challenging and interesting. 5/5",Positive
"I like the battle system and mechanics,the character design is very unique,the story is captivating and interesting and the rewards are very generous,very f2p friendly which is good for a turn-based game with gacha elements",Positive
"It's great! I love the gameplay and how generous the reward system is coupled with a rich story that doesn't get dumbed down by your child ""travel compainon."" It also allows you to play past events AND get the rewards for that, how cool is that?",Positive
"The game feels like a passion project from the developer. It hasn't been a year yet there are so many QoL updates already. Every patch players get free 10 pulls and rewarding events. There are permanent end game contents, easy daily quest, and stackable energy. The fascinating story and lore captured lots of players heart and still enjoyable for players like me who had no Honkai lore knowledge before.Honkai Star Rail is a gacha game that respects your time and I highly recommend it for everyone.",Positive
"This game is amazing, with a graet story, it was really enjoyable but after the update, i can't seem to enter the game after i log in and it crash frequently, now i can't enjoy it because i cant enter the game now, please fix this problem and thank you",Negative
The characters design is good and the gameplay is fun. Most importantly the game/ characters lore and story is interesting too. Hope to see more interesting updates in the future!,Positive
"Its a good game however, after the Version 1.1 maintenance update... The game was unplayable and i can't log in, also there are lots of glitches happening on the game especially in the loading screen",Negative
"Was excited about the game and it's gameplay. While I enjoy genshin for it's action combat Systems, HSR turn-based System is alot more relaxing and require more skill to work with which I appreciate.",Positive
"beautiful game. character designs are nice, scenery is wonderful and detailed, and im loving the storyline. gameplay is easy to understand and fun, i actually look forward to the future boss fights",Positive
"I have a redmi note 11 pro 5g , unfortunately it doesn't work on my phone. It keeps crashing Google for some reason. Update... yes my phone has a chip set 695...not good enough.. better upgrade lol. I've updated the star rating so it's not negative.",Positive
Im running out of things to do in genshin impact. So this game is a good place to unwind and its actually a lot of fun. I like the characters and game play. But more importantly im staying for the story!,Positive
Its a good game. But there is stil bugs like i stared to dumpster and i cant move because of it. I dont know but i think its an funny bug looking at dumpster for nothing and cant move. Only waiting to start the app again.,Positive
I love turnbase rpg games and I love how it's inspired from persona games it's so beautiful and good game but exploration could've been better of course it's not like genshin so we can't have gliding and climbing and that stuff but it would be a dream to have them anyway it's still so fun and good game thanks I remember the hype before this got released and I watched the stream at the release day it was so fun,Positive
"I hate the pvp system. They should've made it like genshin impact's combat. It would've been alot of fun. Other than that, the game itself is the best rivaling Genshin Impact. This game could possibly be on the same level as genshin if not possibly better than genshin. Only complaint of mine is the combat.",Positive
"I love this game but they are have some issues, when cutscenes the scenes play normal but for the sounds it always crashed like sound of a robots please fix it... Idk that bug or what but when i play genshin impact and play story that have cutscenes the game is normal but for this game... No.",Negative
It is physically impossible for me to enjoy this game due to the amount of crashes. I am not even done with the tutorial and I've crashed more times than I can count. I have over enough storage for it to not crash as much as it is but it still does.,Negative
"Utterly disappointing. Another clone of Genshin but poorly executed. Turn-based combat isn't satisfying, and gems are so hard to come by that there's practically no collection aspect to the game either. Disappointment.",Negative
The gane is great! I mean the graphics are üòò. But everytime I check the notice the game crashes. But it doesnt really bother me much. So overall ñ§êñ§êñ§êñ§êñ§ê,Positive
Nice gatcha game with all the bell and whistles. Pull rates are decent. Pity is there. Character designs are gorgeous. Even the lore seems pretty in depth and good. You'll like it more if you have played honkai impact 3rd before. I would say its worth spending some money to make it more enjoyable and easy (farming is a real grind ) but can be enjoyed enough as f2p also.,Positive
Haven gotten to play it since it always crash when i start it since the graphics is way to high and the fps is low so after some time it crashes wish i could play it but based on the videos i see its pretty cool and fun to play,Positive
"It's the same principle like Genshin Impact, but the characters have way more details and the fight szenes are so much better. The landscapes are still more beautiful in Genshin, but u are on a spaceship most of the time so we accept that.",Positive
"Super fun combat and mechanics, when you can actually play. There is way way way too much dialog. Apart from that, the game's great",Negative
The game is good no doubt but but BUT my phone keeps lagging and hanging my phone is brand new but it's still keep lagging and hanging during battles plz check it I always end up restarting the whole device if this issue is not fixed than I have no choice but to delete this game from my device ...,Negative
"Blah blah blah. Skip skip skip. Tutorial so far has been around 2 hours. Resource for gacha after the honeymoon period will be obviously be horrible just like its twin game. Honestly would be nice if they respected your damn time. Cant even skip over boring dialog. Your basically forced to watch the animations and go through the boring ""Walk to point A"" type of gameplay. Forcing you to go through the unnecessary trouble of manually going everywhere. Story seems...typical but nice.Though clich√®",Positive
"Playing since day 1, HYV exceeded my expectation on this game. I never thought i would like a turn-based game. Graphics superb, strong lore, amazing music, beautiful characters.",Positive
Apparently the cross platform doesn't work. so giving this a 1 star until they make it possible on the ps5. I played Genshin on the PS and never linked it to any email like most ppl would do. But once you play star rail it's too late because that game you have to make a hoyo account using an email. Both games require a new email to be linked when you play them on ps5 making it impossible for existing data from a phone to be linked.,Negative
Awesome game! Played this the moment it was fully released. It's as if Honkai Impact and Genshin Impact had a child. I hadn't experienced bugs or glitches YET. Every character's fighting style are very interesting. This game is also not that complicated(depends). Recommended 10/10.,Positive
Hi. I'm still getting the error code 1003 upon login. The only solution applicable for me to get pass through this error code is to switch to data then upon succesful login switch back to wifi. Could you please fix this issue? Thanks!,Negative
"Finally able to play it, to solve login error, just turn off dns on device, so far the game graphic was awesome, and the turn base remind me of the old final fantasy game which is alrte, so far so good",Positive
The only character you can customize is the main character. Pulls are default characters. The on in the pic is fake ads. A good solo playing RPG turn based game. Maybe the best one that I played.,Positive
An incredible experience for turn base gaming i would highly recommend but keep in mind if you are unlucky with the character pulls you can still clear all of the contents using the free 4 star characters and with some planning you can get any 5 star too.,Positive
Controller Support for mobile devices needs to be a thing! Touch controlls aren't ways reliable. Please implement controller support as soon as possible. Once that's done I'd gladly increase my rating.,Negative
"Perfect Game for me!! Since I am 2 years late in genshin I completely stopped because I can't keep up with the quests anymore but since this game just lunched months ago, I can def keep up with it and it's very interesting! I love thos game as much as I love genshin.",Positive
"Pretty fun game with some amazing voice acting and character designs that is unfortunately held back by poor management. They recently started a streaming event in which they capped the rewards at an arbitrary limit and almost all of them were claimed by bots before everyone else had a chance. I'd be happy to amend my review if they fix this situation, but until then, stay away.",Negative
Exceptional. Stories and music are amazingly beautiful. Graphics 11/10. Each and every character is unique and can be shaped according to the playstyle. F2P friendly and lots of rewards from events,Positive
Horrible! Just terrible the game has been launched for a day now and I still can't play it.has been freezing up worse than a console game with a scratchy disk. As an avid genshin player I'm terribly disappointed and appaled that they couldn't fix their servers better for the launch. Will most likely not be playing this in the future.,Negative
"Nice graphic design, gameplay like improved final fantasy battle mode but the game is too much confusing menu quest description and interface, much worst than honkai impact 3rd. character movement not smooth. Most in-game npc attitude so rude wth.. why is bronya like that",Negative
"Everytime I try to play, I get past the two tap to start screens, but then the game never loads. I've restarted my phone multiple times, and reloaded the game multiple times. It just won't let me in.",Negative
"Loveee this game so much, the second I started playing I immediately got hooked. Love the story, and the designs of the worlds, characters, posters, light ones, and so much more. Can't wait for the next update to come out ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
"It was awesome like I wanna stay in this game for real üò≠ the characters, graphics specially the storyline is Awesome! As expected from Hoyoverse ü•∞ hats off to the dev! Game master indeed üòéüí™ I may return since I wanna focus to Genshin aswell as T.O.T ^^ Yes! All of my games are made by Hoyoverse because it felt so real and surely entertaining ü§ó keep up the good work, you guys are truly the best! üëä",Positive
"i got a bug where im stuck at black loading screen. I've tried methods such as restarting my phkne, clearing cache but i still get stuck at the black screen loading. Please fix this as soon as possible, im raring to go play it.",Positive
This is the best game I have played it's so nice the graphics are awesome and the story line too. loved the game looking forward not to give any complaintd bye üòÅüòä .... If you love this types of games you can also try genshin impact I am playing it for years üòÅüòúüòä...,Positive
I love this so far but my only complaint is the turn taking. But i understand that others find it fun. But it just doesn't tickle my pickle yk? But ill keep playing for the lore and characters. I love the expressions on the characters too. They look more lively than the ones in genshin lol,Positive
"I was excited to play this game and for nothing. It feels like it's not even optimized for phone. My WiFi is good, my phone is new, not top of the line but new. And the download crashed several times and after the annoying wait I finally can start the game, only for there to be error 1001_3 for login. Fix your server or game issues hoyo.",Negative
"Haven't met any troubles with the game no probably because my new phone, but it's amazing and the most fun I've ever had with a gacha, well written, extremely good music, funny, and also with the fast forward/ auto battle functions makes the grinding awesome!",Positive
"This is an amazing game. I've been playing it since day 1. Amazing characters, unique styles, a grand story, an expansive universe, and fun mechanics. I'll definitely be playing this for years to come. I can't wait to see what will happen next.",Positive
"Definitely the best game I have ever played. All the characters look stunning. The worlds are amazing and full of details and places for exploration. The combat modes is super fun, and the game is fully voiced in 4 languages. My favorite game of all times!!!!",Positive
"This game has some of the best devs. Gives us a 10 draw every version update, let's us skip floors to just get the rewards, and is about to give us a free 5 star during an event. Props to the devs for that.",Positive
"Need better auto aim or aim assistant for choosing enemy b4 go in battle (apply weakness) , love the graphics , smoothly run 30fps on highest resolution on Samsung A73 , story is A-Okay not bad waiting for more , might updated later already done with the story only daily grind now .",Positive
"I love this game!! My favorite of all time!! The story is so fun and amazing. The graphics are beautiful and clear it looks like art. The characters of the game and their voices are so cool and fun, especially the character you play as!! I can never stop playing this game!",Positive
"The character designs, visual, story, plot, concept, illustration, and almost everything is perfect. The cool atmosphere of this game is 10 out of 10.",Positive
"Excellent graphics and good gameplay, easier to play on mobile compared to genshin impact, due to this being turn based, and genshin is too intense and I prefer pc.",Positive
"Same garbage drop rates as genshin, and is overall a slog to play through, super stingy with summons and with it's abysmaly small cast at the start any character you may have a slight interest in you'll never get it just save your space on your pc/phone and play another game :/",Negative
"I want to rate it higher but they made the same mistake they made with genshin. Time gating your play time with ""power"" is just stupid considering everything you need to build characters comes from it. The game itself is great if only I could play for more than 10 minutes a day",Negative
"This game has GREAT graphics and a storyline. What it lacks are genuine characters. Two of the main characters come off to me like 3/4 of the Millenials now... disinterested, arrogant, bored, and dripping with sarcasm while pretending to be cool.",Negative
Its a very good turn based game.I enjoyed it a lot even though i am not a fan of this genre.I think it needs some improvement with optimization.it can be very laggy at start up.some times it feels like the game is going to break.thats why you get 4star from me.,Positive
"Clean and visually beautiful game. Takes some adjustment of battle if you are coming from Genshin Impact, but it's refreshing change. Currently no immediate feedback as I am ranking up, and wilm update if anything comes up.",Positive
"Genshin is an absurdly expensive game that actually introduced something new to the gacha genre so it was seen as acceptable. Honkai Star Rail has no excuse, it's a wildly generic turn based rpg but everything is absurdly expensive. Why would I spend a dime on this game when there's simply better turn based rpgs out there? I feel bad for players that are stuck in this game when you can easily just go get a real rpg and spend much less on it!",Negative
"This game is very beautiful in visual terms. I want to thank the game designers for this.(I will not forget about the coders and other people who developed this game) The only problem is the limit of 60fps, but I understand that not everyone has a 60+ hertz phone/monitor. Sight waited for the release.",Positive
"it lags so much while downloading the resources, it crashes after a while. didn't even get the chance to play it. uninstalled. i dont know if its the game or my phone. for what its worth, i used to play onmyoji with this phone. onmyoji is 3D, around 8gb, and turn based, which is very similar to this game.",Negative
"Honestly great game, I expected it to be a genshin clone- I won't lie it kinda is- but it's way easier to understand and work with. Love the characters and the gameplay. Of course it has issues, but I like the game enough to look past them",Positive
"So far so good, I got nothing to complain about this game. It's fun to play, graphics are great, although the xianzhou arc was questionable, but aside from that, the character designs are amazing.",Positive
the game was okay AT FIRST. When downloading the game files and updates half way through it crash. I don't know what happened but I open the game again then tried to wait for the game to download files again it crashed again so I decided to reinstall the game it didn't work. I've tried so many times it still didn't work so I don't know what went wrong and I also make sure my storage isn't full so I can download the game files. I hope hoyoverse can fix this please.,Negative
"Incredible game, beautiful visuals, stunning character designs, interesting story, and surprisingly fun gameplay. There's a lot of quality of life things in this game, and generous rewards. 10/10 would recommend",Positive
"Good game. Very easy, and and beautiful BUT very grindy. When the higher your level becomes resources required to upgrade become REALLY REALLY expensive. Imagine farming 1 week just to max level one character near endgame not to mention the relic(equipment) gacha farming.",Positive
"I love the game, but there's just one thing disturbing me: the ambient is always glitching!! I can't even see the floor and the walls. Sometimes the characters glitch a little too.",Positive
"Worth playing. Caring developers, funny sense of humor, good characters, good music, good story, really fun turn-base gameplay. Also very generous with in game currency and there's a pity system.",Positive
This game is awesome but I only rated it 4 because of the log in error please fix that problem that's the only reason why I can't play my honkai right now please please please fix it..... Ok now only 3 stars please fix it I don't want to miss out on silver Wolf she's the only reason why I played honkai please fix this error so that I can get her before she disappear on the banner,Positive
"Got to the 3rd tutorial fight and the game won't load after I win. Stuck on a blank screen in the fight and can open the settings, but can't really do anything. Had to restart the game. Not a good start to new game.",Negative
"Awesome gameplay, Amazing story, interesting events. One of the best game I have ever played. Only downside is character powercheep and amount luck needed to get a featured character on 50/50 chances.",Positive
"Great Turn-based RPG with a rich stories, well designed characters from a design standpoint, and unique gameplay from each event. Definitely a fun game for sure!",Positive
"A very enjoyable game, as far as I'm concerned this game takes everything Genshin Impact does and makes it a lot more attention grabbing! While the gameplay is different from Genshins it suits it's style quite well I would recommend this game to anyone as long as they know how to hold onto there money",Positive
"The storyline is much more refreshing than I expected. The game mechanics throughout are also fairly easy to understand. The game is also generous with the in game currency they distribute out to you at the beginning, a must have for gacha lovers. I'm mostly in love with the graphics and its combination of modern sci-fi and tradtional chinese elements. TLDR: Give HSR a try, the story and graphics are refreshing",Positive
"like the game, been playing since release date but recently it kept on crashing for me. i still have storage so idk why it keeps crashing. would be nice if you could fix this issue",Positive
"The game is amazing. The characters are cool, story is engaging, interesting worlds to explore and I'm a huge fan of turn based combat! Definitely recommend it",Positive
"Game is so enjoyable I play it since date of release and I still enjoy it till now, the problem of this game is basically every gacha game problem, too much luck and gambling and being 100% depending on luck to get over powered characters that makes this game x10000 easier, and if your luck sucks u basically need to pay real money or accept being poor with no OP characters, the rest of the game is good, story is good, voice acting is good, graphics is good, everything is good",Positive
"Ok, it got a bit a better after I put it on normal mode and very low settings. Cutscenes lagginess got better, but it's still very laggy. Humor is great too.",Positive
"The game seems very interesting, even the storyline too, I really like the character designs too, but overall it's kinda laggy at times due to how it freezes up sometimes; maybe you can fix that up?",Positive
Amazing gameplay and as expected intense turn based plus there are many areas to explore like Genshin Impact. Although it's not completely open world the designs and characters are really beautiful.,Positive
Game is good but the korean translation is plagued with horrible tranlsation. Almost every sentence is awkward at best and there's translation error every 5 sentences or so. I have no clue how they thought this was okay. You just have to read it out loud to realize the translation is off. Do they just not have quality checks? Good game but ruined experience bc of horrible translation and downright goofy lines during cutscenes that completely take you out of the immersion.,Negative
"Most people complain because this game is turn-based... if they want an open world game they can buy a console... i touch alot of grass and work a lot so this game is perfect for me... the characters, in game interactions, and content is great... keep working on this game and dont end it abruptly plz... im back to edit my review by asking for a jing yuan rerun plz n thank you lol",Positive
"I really love the turn-based battle system. Not very tiring to grind for materials. Auto-battle needs more improvement, though.",Positive
"Overall good game. But terrible optimization, whenever I play my phone would get severely hot no matter the graphic settings i set, despite running a snapdragon 870 phone.",Negative
"dude it's really good but fps keeps dropping in mobile. it's really annoying bc it mostly lags during battle, and the cutscenes freezes evry now and then. it was like this during beta too, i thought it'd be fixed alrdy",Negative
"Honestly I'm so surprised that I'd be getting into a gacha game, but this one's been really fun and 0% suffocated by ads compared to other free to play games. Would be nice if there was an option to get English subtitles for the battle quotes especially for ultimates.",Positive
"This is a brilliant game, with regular updates, brilliant story line and wonderful characters! The ONLY reason I don't play more often is because I don't have a large amount of spare time (and I usually spend most of it playing Genshin)",Positive
"Very good game, fun, difficult, and great skills. Everything I want in a game. Usually I do not like turn-based games, but I found this one really fun. Keep up the good work and don't make it very difficult to get 5 stars like Genshin Impact.",Positive
"There's a problem with my cutscene, its lag so much whenever it played, especially the sound, it hurts my ear so much. Other than that, no problem",Negative
"Honestly, an amazing experience with unique characters, unique stories, amazing rewards, great pull system, amazing characters, and the free five star coming in v1.6 will be even more awesome! Keep up the great work!",Positive
Great game HOWEVER i wanna be able to message the characters without having them text first and i wanna be able to jump and i also want more world to explore I've basically collected every chest in the overworled and underworld and i need more loot,Positive
"Great game. Good storyline, Smooth gameplay and what I like about this game the most is the Developers actually gives a damn about the player base. This is based on the number of rewards and feedbacks they've been doing. I sincerely hope mihoyo keeps doing this in the future.",Positive
"Actually, this games is fun. But somehow, it was actually really boring when you play it more like there is no interaction. You can't jump, you can't sit in a chair. And the battle was a little bit boring. So, i more prefer playing genshin impact. But overall, it was still a good game.",Negative
"I understand that this game is just newly released, but when i try to play the game, it kept logging me out! Please fix the bug, I'm really excited to play the game. Edit: eror1001_1 kept logging me out, its confusing and frustrating. The tutorial on how to fix it wouldn't work!!",Negative
As a new good am not saying alot but as it right now there alot of bug for Android like everything become white it been like this for 3 day now and alot of more bug and the most important thing is only to fix white screen if I can say it plz fix only this and my fps for drop like 20 per sce plz optimize the game abit is really lag for 4 ram phone.,Negative
"I believe this is the best gatcha I've played so far. The combat is fun an challenging, the story nice an intriguing. If I could complain it would be about the drop rates in the gatcha. Other than that *chef's kiss*",Positive
"Needs more content. I had nothing more to do than dailies, then use stamina, done within 15mins wait 24 hrs for stamina to reach max so dailies can be completed tomorrow. Just this for 2 1/2 weeks. And playing free, you get to do a 10 pull once every 2 weeks. Once you reach end of story that's it, no pvp, pve, challenges, labyrinths, events, anything. And the only update in nearly 2 months, a gacha featured character. Otherwise plays great and characters are enjoyable, just needs more.",Negative
"Yeah this game need better optimization, the login screen a bit laggy. And it's really annoying went i started the game, but the rest of game it's fine and work properly although with high or highest setting. I used Oppo Reno 8 5g btw with Dimensity 1300",Positive
"Im already download resource update this patch for the second time. but both of this cant finnish, and the application give me optional to download launcher data. I dont know how to fix this, because my quota has almost run out to download it all twice.",Negative
"The game is amazing but please fix the bugs, no even once I could open this game before restarting it like 5 times because it freezes actually open the game, it is really frustrating",Negative
the gameplay and story was boring from the very beginning but the later you get into the game it becomes more clear how boring it is the visuals and character designs are stunning though i will install this game and pull alittle every update but thats all i do,Negative
"Really good game. Loads of fun. Need a good phone to run graphics well. Very well made game with good dialogue, roaming around levels, great storyline and fighting.",Positive
"So you want access to our person phone data What does phone state mean? READ_PHONE_STATE is one of the Android permissions categorized as dangerous. This is because it ‚Äúallows read only access to phone state, including the phone number of the device, current cellular network information, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any Phone Accounts registered on the device‚Äù .",Negative
"I got bored so fast :( i was addicted for about 2 weeks until there was nothing to do and dropped the game. I love the characters, storyline and how unsrs the humour is tho! However, the gameplay and especially the turnbased fighting gets tedious n repetitive quickly + the events r super boring + theres not much to do.",Negative
"I'm so excited to play this game I mean we waited for a long time! I screamed when it finally came out though there's one problem, I can't log in. The game always said ""Log in error..."" I wanna open the game for days now but it's still broken üòû",Positive
Sometimes..the game keep freezing ...I don't know why....my device is already meet the the game requirement...there is no problem when I playing other game..I pretty sure the game have bug and need to be fix and more optimised..,Negative
"This is by far, the most suitable game for me (that I tried) since I'm a busy person and auto-battle works for me. The developers are also actively communicating with the community itself so it's a plus for me. Big thumbs up to the team and we might update our reviews from time to time.",Positive
"Hello! The new update is exciting, but there's alot of lagging when I just opened and was about to move my character but the action kept delaying and the lag when entering a fight took too long which causes by lag of the game",Negative
"Very impressive for a mobile game, but it's still a mobile game. Whilst you can play for free, if you want any characters it's one of the most expensive gacha's I've ever seen, and pull rates are very low.",Negative
"Graphics...top notch, music....great, battle sequence....my favorite. So far I'm hooked on this game and I can't put it down. There is only one gripe I have and it bothers me everytime I see it...who on earth decided to make the main characters weapon a baseball bat?!?!?!!?! üò≠üò≠ please tell me he will be getting a sword soon! Plleeeaaaseee!!",Positive
"Ya, as much as i love HSR, The game doesnt even go past ""running patch"" screen. Game just instantly crashes. Really disappointing when i just got some free time after a busy month and game doesn't even load. Hope it fixes soon.",Negative
It's just such an wonderful Game everyone should definitely play it and just now today completed the story mode it's so nice... Tbh this game is better than genshin üòÅ i also played genshin ar56 tho.. Anyways this game story is superb and the dialogue writter nailed it üòÅhehe. Anyway yeah guys congrats and thanks for providing us such an wonderful game feel blessedüôè Thank you once again hoyoverse and game team members... Keep Going!!! Good work...,Positive
"It reminds me of back when i used to play final fantasy vii, i love it!!! Its got really good graphics and layouts as well. I love role playing games, i have forgotten how much so. I was just trying to get litashi at first. Lol",Positive
"The game correct all the mistakes of genshin. also have incredible graphics, history, character design, is not a hard game but definitely an excellent mobile game.",Positive
"Now that I finally decided to quit and uninstall the game, I can make my own conclusion: It's a pretty looking, well designed, well balanced Turn based Rpg that has decent story. But that's it basically..",Negative
"I hope Hoyoverse can fix downloading and data so that when exiting the game it doesn't reset. I really liked this game and was looking forward to it from the start, I hope that later the bugs and features of Honkai Star Rail can be added or fixed;)‚ô°",Positive
"Every patch get the game better, and it's exciting to see what the future of the game is gonna be. Great animations and cool character design, the story is fun to follow.",Positive
"The game's writing is really good. Just need to be a bit more precise with proofreading. Errors like using 'ladder' instead of 'latter' and ""Knock out it off"" should have been caught.",Positive
This game is so choppy it took days for it to even load properly and when it finishes loading there is a static type sound during gameplay and cutscenes. I didn't even start the game yet and already it boots me from the game.,Negative
Its a very unique game and have a great story but i am experiencing stutter and voice break at all the cutscene. Dont know what to do otherwise the game is running smooth. I can also play genshin impact very smoothly and it isnt stuttering in the cut scene. Need urgent help.,Negative
"This reminded me of final fantasy game! Great graphic & UI similar, turn-based fighting with clear tutorial, complex growth system. Great experience so far üëç",Positive
"Gameplay : is fine, skip ult animation when?. Writing and presentation : another self insert writing design... Half assed again. Just stop writing dialog choices. The second person narration is also horrendous, can't write narration? Then don't. Nine ""you"" in one paragraph? Really? Get a writing team on par with counter:side otherwise just give me skip story button. Fanservice: none, Mihoyo is scared of fanservice (miss early HI3)",Negative
"9/10 So far the game really feels it were made by professional developer unlike genshin,the story is interesting and the dialogue are logical n likeable,the writers really good in this one, and so far there have not been a single cringe moment, every joke land and the cutscenes are really well made I didn't felt cringe at all unlike genshin",Positive
It was horrible while logging in with hoyolab username and password. It always responded with account or password error. When I checked for the password everything was fine so it should be the account. But I logged in hoyolab username and password. I use the same account for Genshin impact but nothing of this sort ever happened. Pls check this issue.,Negative
Just the best and funniest thing I've played the trailblazer breaks the fourth wall so much and the obsession over random things always gets me not to mention the logic over the game makes it even better a literary electric guitar is the best weapon I've seen so far,Positive
The gameplay is a let down especially for someone who's not very interested in lore such as me. Y'all went this far but didn't go big enough. It's repetitive and boring tbh. Other things are great but I'm still so disappointed about the gameplay.,Positive
"It's a very fun game, I don't usually like turn based gameplay but this is pretty easy to understand and get used to. The storyline so far is good and interesting, the characters are good, overall a great game.",Positive
"This game reminds me of Fortnite. The idea of characters traveling through the universe is reminiscent of the FORTNITE story, and the train itself draws parallels to the BATTLE BUS. It's truly a magnificent experience, and I urge anyone who's played Fortnite to check this game out.",Positive
"It WAS a great game until i took a break. Now i cannot log back in to get all my characters and stuff, it just Always starts me back at the beginning. I put money into the battle pass, and now its all just freakin gone. Absolute Garbage Account Syncing.",Negative
"The game play , the character desgin , voice acting and music all are good . And ofcourse some bugs are expected because this game have just launched .",Positive
Fell off for a bit but when I came back all my progress was gone? I tried switching to different region servers to see if I was on the wrong server but all of them lead to the tutorial.,Negative
Good story and character development but the RPG aspect is just washed down Genshin which was already too basic. Difficulty spikes very quickly and combat isn't really any fun to begin with,Negative
"I just downloaded the game but nothing has loaded, I'm still on the loading screen for 10 minutes in total (I've deleted it for this reason and re downloaded it) not even a thing that says assets are loading just the loading screen I heard a lot of this game but I cannot see for myself if I can't even get past the loading screen",Negative
Game is okay graphics are good nd all but when the time comes for fighting is not good i can't even select the character which i want to fight with ....whats the point of playing game then ... Fighting is necessary with choicable character... Sry but i am deleting this game ...,Negative
"I'm sorry, but how do you think anyone could beat the simulated universe event if we do like 50k-100k+ and the thing still won't die??? the amount of dmg that the enemy does is absurd, jeez lower your thing, and that's so annoying, I've got super well-built characters, yet I can't beat it? you've set your standards too high this time, hoyoverse.",Negative
"The graphics are amazing, the voice actors are amazing and the characters especially are on fire /pos. I really wish we could jump, though",Positive
"I thought this game was going to be a your typical boring weeb money grabbing game. But I was completely wrong. The games fun, generous with its in game currency and has a good story overall. Only complaint is the energy system. I feel you should have a little more.",Positive
"This game is extremely fun to play, characters are lively and the plot is very interesting. Even if you dont play turn based games, I still highly recommend this game. Great job devs!",Positive
Excellent game have had no issues myself would recommend playing loving the old school turn based combat style reminiscent of old school final fantasy games from my youth even if you don't like gacha games free characters are good and game is generous with rare currency looking forward to playing for years to come.,Positive
One of the best turn-based RPG's out there. Started with the Final Fantasy series and Star Rail gives me the same sense of nostalgia about the first time I played a turn-based RPG. Great game üëç.,Positive
Game is really great. Works perfect on PC but not with mobile. Will increase rating once the login issues with mobile data is fixed. As of now I can only play if I'm connected to wifi.,Positive
"The story are well-packed with SCI-FI concept based on HI3. For sometime it was enjoyable as casual player, no need to get burnout play everyday because some events are permanent. The only thing that it sucked are the Relic Gacha.",Positive
"I love it! The character designs and world building are ü´∂. The gameplay is also great because I enjoy turn based RPGs. Plus, I also need a break from Genshin.",Positive
"I've been playing since release, and didn't expect to get so much enjoyment over such a long time. Beautiful graphics, entertaining storyline, enjoyable combat and plenty of humor. Better than Genshin!",Positive
"it's not bad for a new game, all though I sign up for every beta and still didn't get in. I like the designs very much!! They look incredible,and the gameplay is fun.",Positive
"This is a great game. It's got the same layout as genshin but it's completely different. The only problem is that whenever I try to go on it, it says that there's an error which is frustrating",Positive
"I like the game, I like the story so far. I like turn based-based combat. The only thing that I concern is main character weapon, which using baseball bat as his weapon. I wish developer can change it to sword, dagger, or pistol.",Positive
The game is fine and I love it the quality and the storyline and everything about the game is nice but the problem is that after I a few months I didn't open and after downloading the recourses the app is not opening and keeps rejecting the same happened on my laptop so please fix this bug,Negative
"started on phone, did better on pc. I feel like it makes more sense as a pc game, works fine as a phone app but can't really appreciate the quality on such a tiny screen.",Positive
"I love this game and Ive been waiting for this game to release for a long time but my problem is that whenever I try to open the game itself it would always say ""Log in error, Try again later"" and I would try again later and it would always say ""Log in error, Try again later"" then many tries later I finally got inside the game but then when I was pressing Silver Wolf's ult my screen froze then I got sent back to my home screen when I tried to enter the game again it would say ""Log in error"".",Negative
"It's fun, and the only problem I could think of is sometimes me logging in more than once because of error. It has great designs and pretty aesthetics.",Positive
"So the game was working fine on my Poco x3 pro 8ram. Suddenly after updates which means improving the game is now so laggy to be played(even genshin is not that laggy)FPS drop, Overheating and Crashing. Don't know what happened but i wished i could kept playing it Changed my review to be frank with people seeing it and maybe the dev. Will listen to us... it's been.ages since my feedback and the devs. Don't give abt us, so don't bother your android or iphone is gonna end up heating and your batte",Negative
"Backbone PlayStation Version is not compatible. Great game just wish it worked with this version of backbone. Do not want to buy another backbone just to play this game. I guess I have to wait until it comes out for PS, that sucks",Negative
Amazing storyline . Great graphics . awesome music . Gameplay is not boaring. Over all good game. Enjoying a lot . Some people may think the dialogues are too long but it kind gives some anime vibes . Nice,Positive
Decided to take away a good review as over time playing starts to seem pointless. Leveling characters from 60 to 70 feels useless. Energy regen over 12 hours for 3 pieces of equipment becomes annoying. And same daily nonsense with no feeling of achievement.,Negative
"This patch is fantastic: it introduced permanent content that one can adjust to be more challenging, as well as very useful quality of life features and a free 5 star character who I like a lot. Thank you HSR team!",Positive
"Its a amazing game tho there are some problem that I recently ecounter, everytime I use my jin yuan on a fight it stuck on the weakness screen I dont know if im the only one who encounter that kind of bug but I hope it will be fix because it kinda annoying.",Negative
"As fan of turn-based game's star rail is pretty good overall. The atmosphere is of the game is to my liking too. also the rewards are pretty good, I feel like I'm doing the missions or tasks for something worth my while",Positive
I love this game but the update is constantly disconnecting me off the game this isn't something I encountered before I'm not sure if it's the internet because when using other apps it's fine but I can't do the same when I'm playing star rail hope it gets fixed soon,Negative
"I love the game, but it keeps crashing, playing on mobile is hard due to game lags especially the loading screens lag. I hope you fix it. Thank you hoyoverse ;)",Positive
"The game , graphics ,music, character design and world building are very good .Also the stimulated universe is also very good and challenging. As genshin player I like the game.",Positive
"One of the best games ever, first of all, you can play this game with out ever dropping a single penny on this game, all the characters are fun to play with and are unique. The anime asthetic is amazing, cutscenes are amazing and runs amazingly honestly one of the best games you can have",Positive
"Yes It is pretty lit so far but a I have encountered a bug in the first story like what,I just started and already a bug,the bug is that I can't use the ultimate of the person that is supposed to teach me so please fix it <3",Positive
"This game is literally the best turned-based PRG game i have ever played. This game is very generous, they give lots of pulls to players when they do update (unlike genshin) the character are super cool, storyline is amazing and the gameplays are fire! I can't wait to see more upcoming charavter and stories!! The best game ever.",Positive
"Lag (Stuttering?) I love hsr & all, but I have this 1 problem where my game lags after 30 mins of playing, im starting to think its my device but i have the min requirements i have to exit the game & clear cache before i get to play with no lags, dont know if its my device but i just thought to give a feedback if hsr's the problem.",Positive
This game is freaking cool like other hoyo games this one stands out with the graphics detailing characters and even the ones from honkai impact 3 that grew up such a glow up! Me? I like turn based RPG games and this one stands out I'm looking forward for the future of the game,Positive
"I love the main quest and most of the characters,but I just don't really like the fact that you have to wait for your turn to attack,and you can't just fight to hearts content.but overall the game is okay üôÇüôÇ",Negative
"So far dig the game, if you're into genshin or any other kinda gacha game this is for sure one to check out. Quick to pick up and character design and atmosphere is all great to seek into. Really the overall quality of the game is great. Another gacha game to try out if you're into the genre.",Positive
"Story, battles, voice acting, art, animation, even limited time events are all excellent. They care about the smallest details and it shows.",Positive
"Just uninstalled the game after installing it for hours due to the error 1001_3. I just want to try this game as a new player. It seems to be disappointing though, since I can't enter the game after logging and downloading the resources. It is not very accessible for mobile players.",Negative
"Everything is amazing, the designs, envoriment, story and more. However theres one thing that made me sad, you run out of content extremely fast.",Positive
Game is great and love the new system. Everything works properly and characters look amazing. Please keep up the great work and improve it some more! I want to see more!!!üòÑü•∞,Positive
"I didn't have in off words to describe about this game. Its 'Perfection' so cool graphics, Visuals, characters,etc everything so perfect. I played lot genshin impact & enjoyed so much but now I download this game enjoying more. For me this game much better than Genshin impact.",Positive
"I give one star because of the update button problem. If all resources have been downloaded please remove the update button or say the game is the latest version or all game resources are complete if you touch the update button. The problem with this update button is, if you press the update button and then tick force download resources, the game data or update resources that were downloaded earlier will be automatically deleted. I re-downloaded all the resources of this game. Please fix it!!!!",Negative
"I find it unacceptable that I have been trying for 5 hours to play this game but I cannot get past certain bugs. The device I'm running this on is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 12GB of RAM and 256gb of storage. My phone rocks any game on ulta high settings, it's my daily driver for Genshin and Honkai so I expected Star Rail to behave just as good but it's laggy and just when i manage to bypass a bug there comes another one. One bug is so handicapping that i have to force restart my device.",Negative
"The Story, the Art, the Characters....this is on a phone?? I thought that when I saw Honkai Impact 3rd and now this. They set a new standard in freemium. Part I don't like is the gambling predatory nature of the Wishes and the Tickets even though you are generous and it's not necessary to pay anything I'm still against this practice in gaming.",Positive
The is so well managed by the devs it's crazy. The amount of gameplay even after you play all the story and exploration and events is plentiful. The rewards are extremely solid too,Positive
"the game is good, especially the graphics and the mechanics, however, i logged out for an hour and all of the sudden i can't log back in, it keeps getting error 1001",Negative
"Can't play the game because of the error codes on log in. Tried everything to fix it but nothing works, hopefully they can identify the issue and fix it but it's been a month and I'm not the only one with this problem.",Negative
"more improved,stability,and space friendly.. many rewards, honkai character quality, story more interesting.. the game kinda need more and more specific character to clear such event,well you get the point more patch more chara to pull ..",Positive
The game seems like it wold be fun but I want to be able to play it with my friends on playstation and play on mobile when I'm not home. Unfortunately they make it difficult and confusing to link accounts so I'm going to focus on other games.,Negative
"The music, the characters, the story, and gameplay. At first Im not sure about if I will like the turned based gameplay. Since its a hoyoverse game, I figured I give it a try. The music 10/10, the characters 10/10, the story 10/10, gameplay 10/10. Another great game from hoyoverse",Positive
"Best devs ever, very F2P friendly. always giving out Good endgame content and a enjoyable experience for both casual and hardcore players. Amazing character designs and beautiful open world experience. Can only get better from here and can't wait to see it unfold üòçüòÑ",Positive
"Absolutely amazing game, great art style, great combat, the only problem is that error 1001 3 still hunts me some times the game works other times no , pls fix this game is too good for me to leave it",Positive
I'm giving this game 4 star because of its gameplay and presentation as how they added some character from honkai impact 3rd and made some character playable also like welt yang but the most annoying thing in this game is the lag I mean honkai impact is almost a 24gb game and that work smoothly on my device but this game after taking storage around 8gb the game lags too much like honkai impact 3rd takes more storage than this but it runs more smoothly pls fix,Positive
"Gaah!It finally came out!! I was so excited for this game to come out and it did not disappoint. No not at all! Characters, chefs kiss, Battle and animation, lovely, it's all spot on! The plot has a nice and juicy amount of drama too. Great job Hoyoverse",Positive
"The game is fun, and I like the combination of being able to move around freely in the map with the turned base combat while fighting enemies.",Positive
I can play genshin and honkai but not star rail this must be a joke have 6 GB ram and 128 GB Storage and after the loading screen it says loading error. At first I thought it was a server problem as it is extremely popular and has a large community but I uninstalled and reinstalled it 4 times and still same loading error pls try later. Hoyoverse pls fix this I waited a whole year for this and now I can't even play the game when it is released.,Negative
My main problem is the lvl up system is un balance when reached to lvl 65 you will get no advantage to enemy the only thing that happened is the enemy is getting the advantage by lvl and health and damage And you can't do anything the relics system is worst upgrade system I see in my life you can make yourself stronger by luck or pay real money The amount of drop rate of good stuff is Soo low it's take tow months to get one good pice out of 6 for one character,Negative
"Quickly became one of my favorite games since it's release. Each update has been one banger after another. I've completely fallen in love with the story and all it's characters, and I honestly can't wait for more.",Positive
This is the BEST mobile experience for games. Hands down. I would like to personally thank the lead dev and the whole team for such an amazing vision and fruition.,Positive
This game freezes too often and has worse performance than Genshin for some reason. The frequent frame rate drop and visual delay on the upgrade menus had me restarting the game multiple time.,Negative
That's one of the best rpg games I've played. It's really good. I like the turn based mechanics also the events and the animation. The gacha is not bad at all too. It's quite generous towards the f2p players as well. You can always give it a try! Maybe you'll like it too?,Positive
"Really enjoyable game play, nice open world environments to explore,beautiful music to hum along to and overall a wonderful cast of adorable and powerful characters to compliment a very good story would highly recommend this to my friends, funny enough when i think of honkai star rail i usually think of an old anime called galaxy express 9999",Positive
"Was great but then couldn't play on my current device anymore edit: it's playable on my device now but still has problems, like the map isn't loading in and the game just logs me out randomly, it's also super slow despite the fast wifi",Negative
"Games good. But currently, the story content took less than 2 weeks to clear and now it's just repetitive daily content for no real endgame.",Positive
Good game but after the update my phone keeps crashing etc. I've tried everything and still keeps crashing. I installed it even on my ipad but it still crashes and doesn't work.,Negative
"Tried to invest in this game, really gave it a shot for a few months but even after saving 16000 of tge premium currency couldnt pull any of the 5 star units after the initial set of rerolls I did to get 2, monetization is terrible unless you like shelling out $1000 a month to get character and Lightcones, not fun especially with the timegating just to increase your characters max levels",Negative
"I can't play it on my phone, even if I sign in to the same account, it makes me so the tutorial,and I really don't feel like restarting from 0. Pc works just fine, fun game and all. Edit: Now it just straight won't play.",Negative
I really love this game because of the character designs it's kinda attractive I would say ü§£ and it also has a very nice story and there are no lags and there are no missing parts of the train I really recommend you install this app üíï,Positive
"I would have given 10 stars to this game. I've loved Genshin and I was loving this even more, but ... Slightly before lvl 50 I find myself with totally nothing to do. I can play 10 minutes a day, spending all trailblazer power and then... Nothing. Hope for a lot of new contents in the future.",Positive
"Downloaded because of a lightcone, stayed because of the lore, characters, etc... Thank you for the stamina storage update, it really helped a lot for people not always checking in. Hoping for more to come!",Positive
"A pretty amazing game. You can say, it's probably a combination between Honkai Impact and Genshin Impact. Totally hooked and addicted to it. Please, be aware, this game is graphical demanding. So, a high-end spec phone is recommended for this game.",Positive
"This game is really interesting. The camera angles, animation, and battle system all remind me of persona 5 and I love persona 5 lol. Also mention how addictive it and with the 10 gigs of space on my phone.",Positive
1. Another cash grab game for the rich! 1 pull is $30 and that's a huge rip off! 2. Tutorial is ridiculously long! At this point it's simply insulting to gamers how stupid you think we are! 3. The story is nothing new just a reskin of multiple other stories! I knew this was going to be a disappointment but figured I'd try it anyway. I've wasted time in my life to give this garbage a try and I regret my decision. Oh P.S. gift codes expire far too quickly and that speaks to your greed.,Negative
Hello dev. There some issues of the cutscenes is seems frozen like time to time and the audio is glitchy. I don't know if the update of the game or my graphic pls fix it,Positive
"I enjoy the characters and story, but what is the point on adding people as friends? I am currently Rank 17 or 18, and I thought there would be more, like Genshin, they are pretty much the same but different story, and the fighting mechanics are different. So, are we going to be playing with other people or...? If not, then what's the point on adding people?",Positive
"First of all it takes ages to get to the log in screen, then when I tap to play I keep getting error 1001_3. I've been trying to get rid of this error for hours with every tutorial I can find and literally nothing is working. I haven't been able to play it at all since I downloaded it yesterday.",Negative
"OMG! I don't like turn based rpg but this game... Trust me, Just finish the first mission on the frozen planet and this game will blow your mind. Nice Job Hokay, definitely a very polished and beautiful game, for my personal point of view there is no comparison with genshin, this is an UPGRADE.",Positive
"This game is pretty well built tho, I understand why co-op like genshin here doesn't exist due to limited chests and there's nothing to collect ig, But I do hope that I'll atleast be able to message my friends that I make in this game since there's no other way of communicating with them.(overall pretty good:D) pls add ability to chat themüò≠",Positive
"not f2p friendly, too much grinding, take too many resources to level up characters, needs to level up too many characters to clear end game contents; relics rng are bad, not sure how many months it will take to properly gear just one character",Negative
Really fun game! Really recommend to people who like playing turn based strategy games. The character designs are really good and also the lore overall would play everyday without touching grass,Positive
"Superb graphics, characters, voice acting and storyline. Personally, I am not fond of turn-based gameplay but this game changed my mind.",Positive
"I really love this game from the characters to its gameplay even the storg surprisingly enough since im normally not one to pain attention to lore The character designs are impeccable and just urges you to pull for them, the gameplay is both hard and rewarding (endgame specifically) seeing my characters improve overtime is always nice to see The story is complex at times and and goofy at other but when something big is about to happen it is always accompanied by its amazing ost which i love",Positive
"This is a wonderful game , if you are burnt out of playing other games like genshin, The way I get enjoy a gaccha game without really smashing my keyboard is so comfy to me. Since it has the auto farming system which is a life saver for me and also the constant addition of end game content makes it even better üëçüëç.",Positive
"Very fun, controls for once are quite nicely optimized for mobile, Huge world with varying planets, amazing storyline, and character design and story are just absolutely unmatched, definitely worth a try!!",Positive
"Well I managed to Open it and it is quite the Buggy mess. Now the game has locked me out again I have to re-install, also the White everything bug is still in the game after 2-ish months.",Negative
"After you finish everything that the game has to offer, it becomes very casual. Overall, the game isn't completely open world but its exciting nonetheless.",Positive
"I'm just gonna be real, there's not enough lewd characters enough to one make me pay for them and two no real creative designs whatsoever except that one hacker girl in the beginning. The turn based combat was disappointing because I was expecting genshin gameplay but with a fresh new setting and theme but really the characters just look so dull and their outfits I thought were going to be more Sci fi themed but no they aren't. They just look like Genshin Impact designs that clearly didn't pass.",Negative
I've been waiting for months for this only to be disappointed? I can't even experience the game itself because it keeps telling me login error. Please fix it's been 2 days I'm loosing an interest and desire to even play this game. I didn't install to only receive errors. I didn't wait for months for this. What a waste of time. Fix this.,Negative
It's a great game and the design is great it's just that when I try to play it keeps crashing? But I have good internet and I can play genshin. So I have to install it it again I hope it can get fixed,Negative
"amazing game. storyline, graphics, and mechanics are all just so good. gacha system is amazing as well with the pity and the great characters. my gacha luck isnt that good (i lost all 50/50s so far) but still i love this game. endgame is challenging and really fun too. defo recommend getting hsr!!",Positive
I love this game its amazing i like the gameplay and the Story/ lore is awesome i just love every hoyoverse game bc they are all amazing and yh but more about honkai star rail so i like that we are able to talk to Our friends but i really wish the game had co-op so i can play with my friends but other than that everything is amazing even the character Designs are very cool!,Positive
"Great story, questing and exceptional writing, it is a gacha game so there's all of that attached to it, but even if you're not one to spend, it's worth the time to experience the world building.",Positive
"Y'know, every time I pick up a gacha game, I've got the mindset of, ""Ah, cash grab""; I'm twenty-ish hours into the story and it's absolutely fantastic. The amount of love that clearly went into this thing is crazy, and the fact that there's a gacha system is just free dopamine as a cherry on top, lol.",Positive
I love playing this game and also genshin but since the new update I can't logging like it stuck at the logging page and I can't play anymore please I not sure why but after I try uninstall and install again it show that my device is not supported this game like how come. Please hoyoverse I love playing this game and I was trying to pull for blade üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,Negative
An excellent turn based combat game. The story is immersing and the world building is nice. Hope to see more and better updates to the story line,Positive
"I've been playing both Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail since launch, and I have to say, the difference in how the two games treat their players is night and day. Honkai Star Rail actually listens to the players across all servers and implements great quality of life changes and end game content on a regular basis. Genshin Impact's devs seem to only intend to do the bare minimum, and things won't change in Genshin without some kind of movement to force their hand. #Boycott Genshin",Positive
"Please fix the Google unbind on PC. i uninstalled the app on my cp cause im playing now on laptop. Wanted to unbind my google and use username to login but there is no unbind google on pc. And when going to hoyo site it says ""Unbind in game"".. Also delete the limit on how many ascend materials could be converted via other mats. It helps new players who havent unlocked the shadow enemy needed.",Negative
"I noticed that after downloading the resources, the screen turned black. I thought it was apart of the loading screen yet it's been stuck for more than 5 minutes. Please fix it so I could actually enjoy the game.",Negative
After a while your progression comes to a halt. Run out of credits and materials while the energy regeneration is far too slow. Multiple days to level one trace.,Negative
"The drop rates are beyond terrible. The gameplay is top tier. The story is okay-ish. For a free game, it's an enjoyable time killer.",Positive
Very fun. Just recently hit trailblazer level 60 and currently working on my team. Very happy with the recent updates and the missions are always fun to do. Easily my favorite game at this current point in time.,Positive
"Honestly this is the best RPG/turn based game in mobile! I think other game developers should use this game as benchmark, we should have more this kind of game. Gamestory is rich, even the side quests I love it! Animation is great too,Highly recommended!",Positive
"Good characters design and the gameplay pretty casual for me. Would prefer more fun and gimmick contents. Although jumping is useless in this game, still hoping I could jump with my characters",Positive
"Eh, the characters didn't draw me in for their personality. The mechanics are pretty simple but have quirky effect names for traditional status effects. The cinematic attacks were fantastic though.",Negative
"The graphics and music are great for a mobile game, but the over reliance on rng mechanics, especially in simulated universe, causes players to waste their time.",Negative
When entering battle with 4 characters I will get 3 characters to use. The game is fun but bugs are still in play. I will sometimes get these and have reset game and try again still the same problem.,Negative
I had to delete a few apps for this to be downloaded but it didn't download and made me delete more and after I deleted more apps and after it finally got downloaded it was unplayable! It kept on lagging and everytime it just leaves the app,Negative
"I can't even log in after updating the game, or select a server but before all of that lets not forget the 15 minutes of LAG TIME. This does not bode well for a new game. Uninstalled shame it looks like a good game but unplayable",Negative
"Good and balance gameplay, free to play friendly, massive world exaplaination & tasks , Great character design, smooth no lag ,& bugs gameplay , nice story very great grafics . Good job hoyovers keep going !",Positive
"Great game, somehow made a turn based mobile RPG actually interesting! Crazy! But I'm not a huge fan that you can't reroll and generally how slow gacha rolls are once you've gotten all the one-time rewards.",Positive
"I changed my review because now I don't have problem anymore with logging in to my account. The game absolutely worths to install if you like open world game, it's not like genshin impact even the fighting is very different. But it can be enjoyable and fun.",Positive
"they put way too much work into the plotline and character design and 0 work into the actually gameplay, the battle experience and combat is lame as hell and i had to wait an hour for the game to load up i was actually excited to play this game but when i found out its played like a card game i was genuinely disappointed you have to take turns the whole time at that point its not even a fightü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",Negative
"This game's graphics, mechanics, and characters are well perfectly done, although there are minor issues when a cutscene is played but overall this game is a blast!",Positive
"I know it's a good game and I want to enjoy it but I don't know why, it's so laggy in my phone. My phone can handle Honkai Impact, Genshin and other games but when I go into Honkai Starrail, the train thingy is lagging so bad and it sends me back to home screen. I don't know how to fix this issues. Love you guys game tho",Negative
It is so much fun the open world. The music. The cutscenes it changes how it feels. As u play. The game expirience is so much fun. I love how they are always adding new amazing features to the game To anyone playing for the first time enjoy this magnificent game,Positive
"Great story, artwork and stuff. Drop rates are horrible more than the usual. Having to get a good unit and their best light cone all from gacha with poor rates is near impossible for even light spenders. Otherwise its a fine game. Also make dialogues skippable. People who want to read the story can always not skip. Game isn't running smoothly on some good devices like Samsung s21fe.",Negative
"The usual poorly written, weird, pe#vy story as expected from HoYo. Was hoping this one won't be as bad as genshin & honkai, but looks like it's made for those type of people as well lol. The usual endless grind that with close to no endgame, no pvp, since it is turn based it gets boring even faster without that kinda content. The usual horrible gacha system from their other games.",Negative
The game graphics was good but it has a lot of bug issue.The story was sub par great but has the same story telling as GI(Genshin Impact).The game was to stuck on GI that the game mechanics resemble the GI.The character design was good but I recognized some of them which is similar to a certain game which kill my interest on this game.The gameplay mechanics was good for those who are a beginner in turn based battle system but the added mechanics per character kills the fun.It GI but turn based.,Negative
"Excellent, I'm playing on ps5 but by linking the data I can play quickly on work breaks, only things I would like to see is perhaps costumes for the current characters and some form of coop, like final fantasy ever crisis perhaps",Positive
"The game is very fun to play and the details are awesome! But the problem is, when I updated the 1.1 ver everytime I try to log in it says error code:1001_3. Please fix this problem üôè",Negative
"I cant even start the game. Ive already downloaded the resources and verified it etc. And theres this one problem where it says ""Login error occured try again later"" ive restarted the game many times and i have waited but it didnt work. Its already pissing me off. Please fix your game.",Negative
"Phenomenal game. Graphics are superb, the voice acting is on point and the soundtrack is superb. Well done on another success.",Positive
I really like this game but after some new updates the game is constantly freezing then crashing and it's really unplayable for me now.I can't even do main story quest because of the freezing issue.Developers should be aware of this problems and they still didn't fix any main issue concerning game freezing/crashes.,Negative
The graphics is nice like genshin impact..however it also has lot of quest with long and boring talking and travels with no skips..the reason that I uninstalled the genshin impact..maybe this is also the reason I will uninstall this game quests with long and boring talking and running,Negative
"I can't believe how memorable the writing is, of all things. Beautiful prose, fulfilling in that special way that only good science fiction can. If you love written explorations of the metaphysical, with a little humour thrown in, you are in for a treat!",Positive
"One of my favorite games it's amazing. The gameplay is great, they have amazing graphics, and the stories always leave me wanting more. Ever since I've started playing I've been addicted.",Positive
"Turn based game, rather good and nice little hidden quests for pfp and achievements- nothing that changes story line tho. Rather good give it a try but not enough to keep me hooked.",Positive
"Googles' false advertising ad machine got me with this one. There are no 80 free draws. There is no guaranteed 5 star character. There is, however, a lot of reading, a tutorial that never ends, enough real money items to make Walmart jealous with the selection, and a lack of that open world feel. Big just not open.",Negative
"The game has been very fun for the past few weeks, all of the mechanics and game design are also phenomenal, I've beaten the current story missions and I can't wait for new updates to come out soon.",Positive
"It is an amazing game .. ist more turn base and the maps are disjointed like in dragon age 2 ,but it is cinematic and charming enough to compensate .. not on Genshin level ,but just as intriguing in regautad with it's characters and especially waifus",Positive
"It's a good game. However I come to realize how laggy it is. I do know its my phone however since it's always acting up. The game is an amazing game by far. It is like genshin with a cypernova look, but also has its own unique touch to it, of course.",Positive
"The story is great, the character designs are cool, and the turn-based combat system is interesting. Overall a really good game which offers an exciting and fresh gaming experience, especially for a burned out Genshin Impact player like me üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÑ Thank you Hoyoverse üíû",Positive
Could have been better with a different approach to gameplay style. The tap turn based attack whatever it is called doesn't give the feel of fighting.,Negative
"The game is good, though during battles my screen glitches out once i use an ultimate and i cant see what im doing ( probably because im on a potato device ). Other than that, highly reccomend",Negative
"Been playing it since launch and I can say that it's getting better and better. Fun content, interesting stories and fun game play, what's better is how rewarding things are here. Makes me feel that it's not a complete waste of time",Positive
"Story mission for the Luofu section was broken into 2 parts. God awful decision. 2nd part was barely a full set of quests. I get it's a gacha grind and a live game, but there's no excuse for that. The story is what carries this game. The events in-between are mid at best. It took me over a year to get burnt out on genshin, it only took a few months of HSR. The amount of content is so little, it's abysmal. You need a good balance in a gacha like this and mihoyo you're failing.",Negative
"The game is Good overall, but the grind isnt. The story took to long to come out, the event is so-so, the good and boring event is in harmony. Got bored waiting for the new story, so im gonna go for now and back again when the aniv is near",Negative
Probably the best bit for me is that you can auto battle your way through all daily live service grinding. Definitely makes the game feel like less of a chore while waiting for new events and story to be added to the game. 10/10,Positive
"Games great, especially if turn based combat is your thing. The story and writing/dialogue is really good and worth your time in my opinion.",Positive
"Re evaluation- Played much further into the game, can say I am geniunely surprised. Gacha is still hot garbage, combat leaves much to be desired. Those aside though, games solid, humors top notch, characters loveable, just in general feels great. Story has me invested now for the most part.",Positive
"Not really a turn base combat game fan but i loved this one. The character design is awesome, sound is awesome, the music is just perfect. I love it it's really good.",Positive
Amazing game. Just wish if there's more ways of farming materials than spending energy. And also it would be really nice if we get to co operate with other players while playing.,Positive
"excellent game, good graphics and animation, nice storyline so far, everything is easy to understand and interesting. I love the turn based combat with pretty ultimates!",Positive
"Yeah. It's just a copy of Genshin in a different setting. What's the point? Why make two silent characters? Why couldn't make a normal story with multiple main characters like in Honkai Impact: 3rd? I can already feel it coming: a sea of characters to be forgotten about immediately after the next update. I feel like, in that case, I'll delete this game as quickly as I did Genshin. Learn from the original honkai how games should be made, ugh. I don't want to play soulless commercial projects.",Positive
"Genuinely one of the best mobile games out right now. Story is amazing, characters are amazing, and the dev team is amazing. Definitely earned its win at the game awards. Absolutely worth the download.",Positive
The game is good since I have a good internet I can play it smoothly on my phone but the task is just kinda hard and when I pull for characters it's so hard to get a 5 stars I'm already at lvl 22 but I only have 5 star sadly. I hope I get more good characters . But anyways yeah just what I said earlier it's good :),Positive
"Not too far in but the game is fun, combat looks nice. Haven't paid too much attention to the story but it seems fine. Only 3 stars because I really wish it had controller support.",Negative
Ok so a couple things 1:the game REALLY makes a point of telling you how weak you are if an enemy is 3 to 4 levels above you youd better play perfectly and anticipate all attacks or your entire team dies not just that type advantage matters far too much i went from dealing decent damage with wind to practically nothing with thunder 2:the character gacha rates are so low its hard to know if you guys want us to summon for characters or spend money and still get nothing please increase the rates,Negative
The game is great but it get bored just after a few days. Because there is not much content in the game. The stamina take too long to regenerate. And everything u need to develop your char need to wait. Seriously boring.,Negative
"Overall this is an amazing game. Fully fleshed out characters, great tier trees, easy to understand.i hate the gacha rate. To make up for it is for 300 pulls and the first 50 guarantees 5*. The story and humor are amazing. I look forward to serious expansion. This is already better than many console games. If they want to make console games I'll play them. Ps5 please.",Positive
"Good relics are rare enough, but it's infuriating how upgrading even the good ones always manage to go to the worst stats. There is enough rng in your game without the need to actively screw your playerbase at every opportunity.",Negative
"game was fine during 1.0, this is definitely a me thing but when it updated to 1.1 some parts of the game just started disappearing like the ground. it bothers me alot. i'm giving 3 stars.",Negative
"A compelling story with engaging gameplay and over the top ult animations. Imo much better story than genshin, and also much, much more f2p. Don't play only if you don't like turn based rpgs",Positive
"Set in a sci-fi setting where you traverse worlds and meet sad emos to silly goofy characters. Your MC likes to dig trash cans, teleport using a toilet, trolling people and overall gremlin energy. The story so far is very interesting, unlike Genshin where the story focus on Lumine/Aether, Star Rail focuses on other characters and the mysterious MC along the way. Appropriately automated battles for farming and optional too. Character building is WAY easier and less time consuming than in Genshin.",Positive
"I just started playing the game today and im still at the tutorial level. When i just stated i wanted to change my graphics and FPS after i did that my whole game turned white. U can still play the game but it becomes uncomfortable bcs everything turned white (Furniture, room, breakeble item, etc). Pls fix this as quick as possible i would love to play the game without much disturbence",Positive
"This game works flawlessly on my phone, the humor of the game is on spot. The characters are so human and have such personality. I'm not too far in the story but the interactions of the characters are so good like seele and bronya connecting even when they come from very different origins.",Positive
"I have been playing this game since May 3, 2023 on my Infinix Zero 5G 2023 phone and I can say that it is amazing. It consumes less hardware resources than Genshin Impact, and is more F2P friendly than any of the recent gacha games available. Every single character that the game provides whether through ingame progression or through pulls have been amazing, no need to spend any money. Amazing game for casual gamers like me.",Positive
"Great game in all aspects and despite the nature of it monetization is very F2P and budget friendly, is greatly balanced so that you can experience all the story without grind, but pushes the limits of your game knowledge and grind-time on its endgame. The game receives updates every 40 days and the developers seem to be attemptive of is community. This's a game that rewards dedication and patience for those who want a light daily grind, an amazing story/lore and beautiful characters.",Positive
It's a fresh experience for Turn Base game. Just the story is quite slow for every x.0 updates. Too much relax time makes the Story stuck at certain level.,Positive
"great game! been playing since it came out but one thing i don't like is how much storage it takes up. whenever the game updates, i always have to free up space in order to actually play again but other than that, an amazing game to play when you're bored!",Positive
"The gameplay are hard to understand but fun in it's own way. The fact that every characters' ultimate have their own animations. Keep it up, Hoyoverse!üëç",Positive
"Love the game and its playing style, animations, design, and so on. And especially the reward that is the upcoming limited 5 star Dr ratio.",Positive
"Very nice graphics, has a lot of comedic lines and plots, love the fighting style! The characters are all very beautifully done and are very original. Definitely recommend playing it!",Positive
"love it already, btw some of yall may be complaining about the graphics or smoothness of the game but in the end it all comes down unto what kind of device u have whether it can handle it or not, some also may have problems that are not based on the device, if so then try contacting costumer services it really helped me too (coming from a low graphic gamer)",Positive
The only issue I have with the mobile version is the sound quality for cinematic cutscenes it sounds muffled or distorted for me I'll still be playing but I hope this gets fixed if it hasn't yet,Positive
There was a bit of a problem with the cut scenes the voice lines would always glitched out and so would the animations but overall it was fun to play definitely recommend,Positive
"quests and achievements got bugs, still not yet fixed even though already submitted tickets. repetitive battles, tutorial too long, can't skip cutscenes nor wall of texts, quick battery drains, awful rates of pulls. can't change main character's appearance despite their lameness sticking out like a sore thumb.",Negative
"You absolutly do not need to drop any money on this game and you'd get the full experience, that said I would gladly pay 50-70$ at least for a game of this quality. It's got pros and cons, what good game doesn't? Doesn't stop me from being immersed in this univerese they created and having a blast exploring all honkai star rail has to offer.",Positive
"The game is fine. But the controller support seems lacking, please add gamesir x2 pro xbox as part of your supported conteollers list. Despite it being a controller related to xbox, the game seems to not recognize gamesir x2 pro as an ""xbox controller"".",Negative
"No skip button, tutorial take too long, gacha buzuq,. Karakter daur ulang, Auto Battle ada yang tidak bisa di gunakan di stage.. No bgm while roaming.. Fps cap 60, no upscaling no ray tracing,.. Battle system good, this one who save from 1*",Negative
"Finally the chat system overall good gameplay and rewards, but I have encountered some problems of suddenly it became so laggy it's always unresponsive and there's always a text ""Honkai star rail is not responding"" when earlier morning it works fine?",Positive
Im giving it a 1 star for now cause it keeps crashing for me Idek why but I was still in the downloading resources and it just crashed for no reason pls fix it cause I've been waiting for this to come out and I was so excited to play it but I was disappointed when it keeps in crashing. So I'm hoping for you (Hoyoverse) to fix it pls its not just me but also the others that has the same problem as me.,Negative
"Having tons of fun with this. A turn-based game with Hoyo's polish for character design, fun and expanding end game, a GOATED team behind it that listens to player feedback and acts upon it quickly, not to mention they're far more generous in this game than in Genshin. Loving it!",Positive
I love this game so much. The design is good and the play style not hard. The maps is big. And theres so many interactions with hidden achievement. Very funny! And theres a lot hidden easter egg too!!!,Positive
Best game I have ever played! They make things so much easier to understand! 10/10 would definitely recommend you to give it a try full of puzzles and beautiful graphics! Give it a try!,Positive
"Honkai starrail is just as good as genshin in my opinion, the story is magnificent and funny, the turn-based combat has such beautiful animations and its not so hard to progress either >its easier to get pulls than in genshin",Positive
"Overall amazing, all characters have their unique personalities and designs. (although the lofu dresses are becoming boring, I hope that will change with future characters.)",Positive
"I only see half the train the fps spike is so bad i cant even play tbh Ive spent 3 hours trying to keep finishing the first cutscene and failed i also searched up thing to boost the fps problem and crashes i did all things the fps improved but it still crashes half way Please fix your loading screen and cutscene for mobile players Similar problems with genshin , loading screen fps and a lot more missing game things üòî",Negative
"I understand that this is a good game but i can't even start to play because the loading screen is stuck and it won't even start Edit: I changed the rating because it is now finally working, both on my laptop and phone and I'm already addicted.",Positive
"Pretty good so far, even though my graphics is on very low i still enjoy the because of its contents. It does feel sometimes repetitive gring like relics and materials. But i like this game",Positive
"So far I've been really enjoyed playing this game, the gameplay mechanic, art style, lore,... Everything has met my expectation. Looking forward for more contents in the future. 10/10 would recommend.",Positive
"I absolutely love this game! It runs so well on Android, plus it actually feels nice to play comfort wise! The game it's has an amazing storyline and characters! It's a FTP friendly game with tons of options to gain currency!",Positive
I'm excited about the game to release when it's release I pass a few days before I install it when I install it it's a little bit laggy then the game is loading the resources is being downloade then suddenly the game crush when the resources is completely downloaded when I'm trying to enter the game it's keep saying log in error with numbers on it please try again later when I press confirm it's takes me to that start button when I press the start button the games is Froze that why I rated 3‚≠ê,Negative
I love it! This game does not require much time but still provides the entertainment I need. Just the right amount of quests and puzzles plus they are very generous,Positive
I was excited thinking it will be like Genshin Impact but in sci-fi setting unfortunately turn-based fights are real let down. Graphics are good and it can even run on older phone.,Negative
"Nice gameplay system and that's all, same gatcha system as Genshin Impact(it should have been like Honkai Impact), graphics are nice but it melts your device so only choice is to play on pc. What's the point of playing this one over Genshin? The gameplay style? Cuz the rest its just a mix of Genshin and Honkai, until you guys place a good gatcha system im keeping the 3 stars, one of the worst gatcha systems just like Genshin",Negative
"Very upset. This game could have been fantastic 4 everybody but instead u decide 2 lock 120FPS exclusively 2 iOS as well as controller support. Theres a lot of mobile users n the world that would love 4 equality 2 be present n most of ur games. All we're asking is 2 let the Android community have controller support like iOS & PC. Don't tell me u understand cuz u dont, if u did we would have controller support. Also this is not genshin so stop comparing it, it's turn base like FF. #dobettermoveon",Positive
"One if the best games I've ever had. The PC version is amazing, and so is the mobile. I loved all the characters and the intense story line. HIGHLY recommend!!",Positive
"You cant join the event just because you haven't clear out the main story. I was playing this game but as a free to play player you can't keep up with the game because the rewards are too low, I didn't miss a since day playing this game but still you can't keep up with the events. I would love to keep playing this game but you just can't keep up with, not event the events helping you out. Very disappointed...",Negative
"Love this game! F2P friendly, lots of rewards, great story line and I LOVE that the grind is the only thing tied to stamina. I can whole heartedly recommend this game now and in the future. Also, genshitters can take the L and get Dr. Ratio'ed",Positive
Beautiful game but horrible amount of text in some cases with side quest that are horribly long. Enjoy the combat not necessarily reading wall of text.,Negative
in sync with my body it became very noticeable when I was Olanzapine compromised I could not sleep but even then and that's when I realized without it I would be deaf. That's right ladies and gentlemen the beating of my heart was out of wacked it was like when water accidentally got on your ear and it rings annoyingly although I can hear just fine cause their was no water. This was particularly strong when I laid down attempting to sleep. I finally understood why bats I see in the terrace hover,Positive
"Pretty fun! It's basically Genshin Impact but turn-based and Sci-fi. The four star characters that you start out with are pretty good, so you are not at a disadvantage compared to those who pay.",Positive
"Love it, cute characters, nice story, turned based with possible auto so you don't have to focus up all through (people who trash it cause it's turn based- it literally says so in tags, perhaps actually check first before assuming), I play on laptop cause of the space tho, but so far enjoying it ^^",Positive
"The storyline is engaging, the combat system works well, and the game runs smoothly without downgrading the graphics.",Positive
"This is a typical gacha game, you can play free to play and grind and it's still fun or spend 1000+ dollars if you're a whale. The difference is this game has triple A game studio quality and reminds me alot of Fire emblem or Persona. Voice acting, 5/5 graphics 4.5/5, game play 4/5, world building/story/lore 4/5, characters 5/5. Only thing I can complain about is, this is one of the worst gacha games for rolling for characters. Extremely low 5 star rates and pity takes a long time to get.",Positive
"This game is a mistake. Story is mediocre, core gameplay has no depth to it. The powecreep in this game is insane. Only thing it has going for it is the simulated universe and occasional limited events based on SU. This is NOT a game to invest your time into.",Negative
"I like the game. Story is really good for now, game mechanics is nice and refreshing. It has funny dialogues. Can pet Peppy. Graphics as expected is really good. Game gives plenty of rewards :D",Positive
"Great turn-based game with amazing storyline and characters! As long as you exert enough effort, currency can be obtained easily! Highly recommended!",Positive
"First game from MiHoYo (Hoyoverse) I play form day 1 (launching). And now I'm attached to this so much. Can't wait for the main story update. Suggestion for developer, maybe u can add Ultimate/Burst Cancel Button for the upcoming update? That's will help a lot of player so much. Thank you",Positive
"The character designs are beautiful but the xianzhou luofu story was downright horrible, for a game with no PvP or exploration and totally dependent on story content it was an extremely bad. I hope that you would try to fix the matter",Negative
"Edit: Just another good looking game that's it. The graphics and character designs are nice if only their gacha wasn't so terribly balanced. The gacha is always partial to ""light cones"" (this games version of support cards). The gacha will more than likely never be a character. Mihoyo has an absolute garbage pile account registration that constantly forgets who you are, all your progress and anything you've bought. Mihoyo is turning out to be nothing more than a scam anymore...",Negative
"Amazing graphics, great voice acting, a worthy sequel of Honkai3rd. I can't wait for a lot of future content, especially the possibility of meeting one of the Masked Fools. Because they're never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down. Never gonna turn around or desert you.",Positive
I like this game very much but the only thing I am giving 3 star because the i don't like the game combat system i love to combat enemies with 360 view just like genshion impact. I don't have much data and storage to for genshion impact so i request you that can you please change thiscombat system and made it like genshion impact.,Negative
"Idk if it's just me but the story pacing seems. A little bit rushed? And why does everyone have to act to edgy and cool at the start- I believe that the font being used here could be much better too considering its a modern looking world than Genshin but, maybe I'm just being picky. I understand that what they chose has a reason Story wise reminds me of FGO, playstyle is also FGO x Persona. I kinda wished they have this distinct nuance that keeps the game different apart from FGO and Persona.",Positive
"I'm going to update my review to 1 star for now, I have stopped playing the game for 1month and installed it again right after 1.4 update and everytime in cavern of corrosion my phone freezes everytime I use ultimate, I tried reducing my graphics to very low and it still happen, my phone has octa core mediatek dimensity 7050 processor and 12gb ram, the previous version of this HSR is really smooth on my phone but now this issue is ruining my experience. What might be the problem?",Negative
Wow! Honkai maybe like Genshin in some ways but there's also some ways that honkai is better then Genshin. Here's why: 1.Faster loading 2. The map isn't to boring 3. Decent stories. But Genshin and Honkai share one trait which is making your phone either warm or hot as hell. But still pretty good game! Btw the characters looking fabulous!,Positive
Can't play the game üòî. I tried turning off my phone and restarting it. Even reset my wifi. But it keeps saying something about log in error. Wanted to give this a try since I like playing the other game.,Negative
"This game is amazing. If you're looking for a Turn base game, this is for you and if you're looking for a casual waifu game, this is for you. There's nothing I can complain about this game, the story is good, graphic is good, fighting mechanism is good, music is good, and most importantly, this game is really F2P friendly.",Positive
"Give us the ability to skip cutscenes. I just want to play. It's just generic anime story line with generic anime characters. In other words, story is lame.",Negative
"Honkai Star Rail is such a fun game with fun characters with fun interactions and the best science fiction out there. The art style is cool, the details are cool, and the battles are also challenging.",Positive
"Premium level turn based.. enjoyed the story ,art,ost, and the gameplay so far. Also please consider adding 40/45fps cap.. its like the good spot for mobile .. 30 is kinda laggy but 60 is not suitable for long play.. hot",Positive
"I had some login problems before but I just contacted the support and they were just amazing! They helped solving the problem pretty quickly and the game is simply wonderful, thanks hoyoverse for this beautiful game and for aways working in doing better and better!",Positive
"I haven't gotten that far into star rail but so far, I personally think its really good, however one thing i would say is that the turn based gameplay gets boring to look at after a while. Overall its cool",Positive
"Really Good game... animations, music and voicelines are above S tier and the game is super easy to play and you can auto-play the grindy part of the game... as a F2P, they give generous rewards and its easy to collect lots of stellar jades by doing daily stuff",Positive
The game is pretty amazing it has an exciting story a very satisfying battle mood alot of cool tales and twists all around many amazing rewards i really like it! Its just missing smth very small Like a pvp mood so players get to challange eachother it would make the game absolutely purrrrfect,Positive
"this game is amazing! I love the designs, the characters, the gameplay, and how the whole system works, but this game takes up way to much storageü•≤",Positive
"Boring. The combat is dull, I cared nothing for any of the characters I was introduced to and the unskippable cutscenes were hard to watch after being shown the MC.",Negative
"i encounter a problem that whenever i got in a chatting with npcs, characters or in story quests and after solving puzzles the background will go black and my character will be the only visible also when i teleport on some places on the map the background also black, this is kinda annoying i hope you will be able to fix this problem.",Negative
"Enjoyed itüëç I like the gameplay, the storyline, as well as the characters in game, playable or not. The game mechanics are also easy to understand and played around with. But I fo hope as the patch updates, the size wont be as crazy painful as genshin's fontain update-- please spare my storage space Àö‚Äß¬∫¬∑(Àö ÀÉÃ£Ã£Ã•‚åìÀÇÃ£Ã£Ã• )‚Äß¬∫¬∑Àö",Positive
"Best experience since star Ocean and phantasy star. The graphics are clean and crisp. The game play is ok. Not sure that I'd of gone with turn-based but I can make do. All in all, a wonderful game.",Positive
"Hyv, thank you for making genshin,impact 3rd,tears of themis,zzz and star rail... They are really fun to play plus f2p friendly (if you like to farm).. anyway thank you for everything you put into the games! (I left a 4 star because the new player loading is 3 hours TvT please make it a bit faster hyv, over all the games are very enjoyable)",Positive
The characters are so adorable specially March! I just found some issue like game freezing when in battle and a bit of lagging but other than that all is well.,Positive
"I can say that it's a pretty good mlgame but one bad thing, if you have a weak device, try your best to get used to the lagging. If you can't, I suggest don't download it as it can take up most of your storage. Overall, it's a good game, just get a strong device with a lot of storage and you'll be able to enjoy it.",Positive
The game is extremely good! But the problem is that whenever their is a cutscene the voice over seems to lag and I don't know what the problem is....is it because of my phone...? If so what do I need to do to fix it...?,Positive
"I absolutely LOVE THIS!!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, port it to ps5 like you did Genshin Impact!!!! We need a PS5 version!! My phone has to run it at the lowest possible settings. I mean I guess I could just get a better phone but I'd still love a ps4/5 and PC port",Positive
"The graphics and animation are awesome. Just disappointed it's a turn based game, so won't be continuing play.",Negative
"I just love every character it has shown and the dialog it has for some of the random things. Plus, all the children characters are absolutely adorable!!! Hook is my absolute favorite by far‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°",Positive
"I rlly love the game but is there something I could do to the visual bug? The environment keeps on glitching and always made the environment dissapears, like in the loading screen, the express visual is bugged, pls help",Positive
Updated review After many QoL changes and more endgame I'm increasing my prev rating. 4/5 avg now! I love the char & world designs. Devs seem to listen to the community with qol changes. But still missing a star for crucial points 1) gacha rates are still pretty bad (maxing a charact is so $$$) 2) no story skip (rough on alts and ppl who are there just for gameplay) 3) although i said i like the char designs some are already getting repetitive Have more pts but no more review character space,Positive
The game is somewhat addicting and the animations are almost perfect However i feel like the whole budget went in for the bursts The names of the NPCs are bad Example: Child who idolizes Gepard or Man with afro And the characters names could have been more creative like the ones in Genshin. I mean Gepard (literally German word for cheetah) Or Kafka Also what's the Point of freinds when you can't even Text them or Join them? I preferred the fighting style in Genshin better too n pls add Jumping.,Negative
"Genuinely the best in terms of gameplay , qol upds , character designs , music and listening to the feedback from community , cannot wait for 2.0 for the new story and new characters!!",Positive
Awesome gameplay. Love the graphics and the battles are fantastic. This is the best turn BASED MMORPG I have played yet. I can set and play this game for hours.,Positive
"I play mostly on PC but this game is fantastic. It's everything I want out of a HoYoverse game. And the loading time is so fast even for my 11 year old device. It's fast paced, easy to learn, and fun to keep grinding.",Positive
"1* coz 1st, Laggy on phone & laptop even tho I have 16gb ram, decent storage on both and good gpu, using one of the latest model of my phone brand it still lags at the lowest graphics. 2nd it has low drop rates for every single material particularly relics/artifacts and trace materials for skills and talents. 3rd it has very low 5* rates and the gacha is just so bad, its worst than ur other games. 4th very little content, u leave players hanging and very few rewards. 5th expensive top up & packs",Negative
"i loveee this game! My only con is that sometimes I cant log in? It restarts the entire game, Currently im stuck at the beginning and Idk what went wrong- Its better tgan genshin impacts con about how it expired my gameplay and made me re log back in bcs i didnt play for too long but I had forgotten my pass so i gave up on that-",Positive
"Hi, I don't know why but my phone heats up fast even in the lowest graphics settings. I can play Genshin Impact just fine without heating too much even on longer play time. ü§î",Negative
2nd review after 3month . I just try again in hope that this game will get better because now you guys have a lot of money. But üòë you guys just trole me again üò≠ Login error still exists even after 3month . Nothing to much to say this game is a very high quality cash grab . I Will never play it again. Anybody watching this review my recommendation don't install the game.,Negative
"Extremely free-to-play friendly, the 4 stars in this game are on par with 5 stars in other gachas. There are not even 3 stars. Really respects your time, no need to no-life this game to clear all content. Hoyoverse's high level of quality also just cannot be beat.",Positive
"The gameplay is rather enjoying considering it's a turn-based game. Even though the game is still unpolished due to bugs, this might turn out to be one of the best game in the future.",Positive
"Just like every gacha, the free players are in ""wow"" mode because they see value in free. And just like all gacha, once you make up and the game power creeps, you can't spend enough to keep on top... meaning never spend on Mihoyo unless you plan to upgrade devices capacity, $1200 plus in-game spending, nope just Vaca to Taiwan. Support Taiwan, it was an Indigenous independent island before Japan invaded, and China ran off Japanese soldiers. China never left and claimed Taiwan as part of China.",Negative
Everything is pretty good but I wish I can skip the conversations as some of the people might want to just do finsh the quest or something to unlock another question that they actually want to focus on.,Positive
such a fun game!! I love turn based games and it's so amazing graphics wise! some things are difficult but I love when a game has a challenge !,Positive
Perfect. Just perfect. Oh but i would love to be able to jump bit other then that its just perfect. Especially as a genshin player i love how they are generous with the rewards.,Positive
"The drop rate in this game is absolutely HORRENDOUS sitting at 0.3% for a character, you will almost never pull a 5 star unless you are really lucky or sink so much money into the game that you can guarantee one. played for months and only pulled one 5 star character outside of the guaranteed one from new player event and considering you need dupes to get eidolon powers up it's not worth your time or money 2 stars because graphics and gameplay are really good, increase the sorry drop rates!",Negative
"Amazing character designs, fantastic for free to play people, the storyline is also great! The voice acting is on point! The community is positive and higher lvl ppl r so helpful toward lower lvl players",Positive
"Incredible game, I was hesitant at first because I was going through Genshin burnout, but I truly do love this game. The mechanics are smooth, and the characters are beautiful.",Positive
It's is really fun and interesting but it's kinda a gamble if you get the person who you want (if there's a character you want they always come back a few banners later)(If you got a 5 star that was on the standard banner then you have more of a chance to get the character you want)(Your pity moves to the next banner,Positive
"The more I see this game (playstore, yt ads, etc.) the more I want to play Persona. It's super boring and you can't skip the cutscenes. Gotta give it one more star for the graphics and designs tho",Negative
"This game is cool and fun! But the problem is that the enemies are too strong! No matter how much I try to defeat it, I'm always the defeated one. Have mercy for noobies please.",Positive
"Its really good game and nice quality. Can also text other people around the world with text and cute chibi imogis (sticker) and very nice stories of each character background very very fascinating game. And nice to play withs friends and other people around the worldwide This game is good cause of experience, plot, funny humur, alot more. And hope all gamers recognize this game as a non-toxic game to people. One day or Day 1üïú",Positive
"My God this game has to be the worst gacha experience. The pity system is almost a slap in the face if you're not willing to shell-out more than $50 each time, and even then you're not guaranteed a 5-star. I absolutely cannot stress to other players if you're looking to even get a single 5-star character, do yourself a favor: don't download this clear cash cow.",Negative
"good game, played through honkai inpact 3rd and genshin before, my expectations were high for this game when it was first announced. It smashed my expectations. I was skeptical about the turnbase system, people saying it will be boring and stuff, no i honestly prefer this turnbase system over genshin's system as you would actuslly have to think about your next course of action instead of mindlessly spamming elemental reactions in genshin. Story was good, character designs are also good",Positive
"This is a MUST-TRY turn based rpg game. It's fun to play, it's hilarious! Clean UI, beautiful graphics, fantastic music, best of all, NO ads!!",Positive
"Entertaining game, characters have really good personalities, the story is fine, the humor is peak. A pretty solid game, and the only turn based combat game that I like.",Positive
"Game has quality parts, but feels pointless after clearing current content. Prices are high and the value you get for what you pay is questionable. Due to bad interaction with their customer service team, I will no longer support product. Too much greed and not enough ""customer support"" from such a large company is shameful.",Negative
Beautiful but very Difficult. I want to play this game but I'm so tired of PC and mobile only it infuriates me. This is a beautiful game but this is hard to play on mobile. If I don't see a game on console soon? I am never me my buddies but we all think this never playing a hoyoverse game again.,Negative
"Everything this is awesome. The fighting is terrible, it would be better if we don't have a loading screen for an small enemies as well.",Positive
"If you thought the drop rates in genshin were bad. my gosh are they horrible here! It plays alright which is fine, but all of that's null and void if I can't really get me characters I like. I want to give this a better review, but you guys need to adjust those drop rates. To say they're bad is an understatement.",Negative
"As I downloaded the game, I waited for it to load and then I start to play. I got into the beginning of the story and started doing the quests. But all of a sudden, I pressed the home button and it went to 5% real quickly and it made my phone really hot so I had to uninstall it fast. Is it supposed to do that?",Positive
I have no experience with this game because I can't even get pass the loading screen. This is actually upsetting because I deleted stuff like it ask not to mention the update is long ask heck then I had to reboot it because there a error which mostly likely sucks,Negative
"Didn't find it very engaging. EN Voice acting wasn't great, except for Kafka. All the characters, save for Kafka and the red haired chick, look 17 and under. Wasn't a great fan of the character design, I love wearing dresses and skirts but can't imagine warriors wearing dresses and skirts to battle. Gameplay reminded me of a less fun Persona 5",Negative
"Nice game, I'm enjoyed so i spend for battle pass and supply pass but i think the game doesn't want me. Lost 50/50 rate 4 times in a row and all with high pity (>70 pull). I'm done with it. I'm going to be f2p now.",Positive
"we don't have much freedom in movements, can't jump, fights are turn-based that's so boring and doesn't rely on our techniques and strategies... ALSO (travelling-useful and special skills) don't exist such as making your movements faster/special abilities like yelan's fast run, nahida's skill to collect plants and aim enemies, kazuha and venti's skills to bend air for gliders to fly, all fights are the same it only depends on damage that's so boring",Negative
"I love this game ! I played Honkai and Genshin Impact but this game just speaks to me and I really think I will love this game in the long run, though this is similar to Genshin, this game is just more interesting and less grindy than Genshin for me, the only problem I have is I can't clear the echos of war, but that's my own bad skill, a wonderful game! Keep working hard and I'll keep wishing and hoping it becomes as famous or even more than Genshin, love you HoyoVerse !",Positive
"This game ia still a bit unstable so i'll wait untill it stabilizes, mainly bug fixing the graphic and log in (for good, not temporily). If it does work properly, the game is pretty fun tho",Negative
This game is really cool and very generous with its players but for mobile players storage is a problem i recommend to put a function in the game that can delete past quest that are already done or finish so mobile players can delete it and reduces the storage of the game just like tha settings in genshin thank you,Positive
"I absolutely love this game. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because unlike Genshin, I'm unable to link the game to my Google account on my pc. On genshin, I can do that. When I try to use the same login that I use for the account I have(since I'm playing this on my phone) it starts me completely over. Will the devs be making a way of linking Google accounts?",Positive
"It VERY GOOD GAME turn base rpg,U can play even U r busy. It very friendly with busy ppl, working ppl, lazy ppl and very entertaining LP. Even the size is big, and the character desain it's like bit like a like. But over all 10 out of 10. I hope I can play at switch too",Positive
I really enjoy this game but i can't even play it no more my device is having a hard time or not loading and it is unplayable. My phone doesn't reach the specified specs needed to play this game but i would like it to be compatible on my 4gb ram 64gb phone because this game is fun and I'd like to play it.,Positive
"I love this game! Even the graphic didn't good, it was still enjoyable! But it crashed a little, my storage isn't full. Please fix this.",Positive
"I love this game..Turn based combat is a ton of fun. Everyone expecting Genshin is forgetting about honkai and how that played. Hoyo isn't limited to one type of game, and I already really enjoy the story. Looking forward to more! PS. I love the sense of humor in this game",Positive
Game is quite graphics are awesome but I am apparently experiencing an issue where I'm not getting sound like none no sound I unistalled reinstalled ran a data fix still no sound pls give me some kind of fix for this.,Negative
"It's a fun and exciting turn based rpg. One major drawback is it keeps logging me out, which is irritating since it waits just long enough for me to forget my log in info",Negative
"If you play the game with Google Play account, you will NOT be able to transfer your progress to other platforms, because Google Play account is apparently not linked to your Gmail. It's 2023 and I don't understand why this is still a problem for the devs.",Negative
"Game is amazing, fun, and has a lot of endgame, you can basically get a guaranteed 5 stat every patch! But all of these features should go also to starrail's cousin: genshin impact, wich would really enjoy the quality of life changes startsil gets every patch too,",Positive
"I don't know if this game is paid or just playing and having fun. Graphically it's as good as a console, above the PS2 maybe in the position of PS3 and PS4. taking a sci fi theme reminiscent of xenosaga and star ocean, games like this are rare on android, set high and can run well on Dimensity 1300",Positive
Well I would like to rate this higher but I can't cause everytime I try to load this game up I just get black screen and for like 3-5 minutes then I have to re-open this game to get the loading screen to work then it kicks me to my main home screen everytime. Idk what the problem is but I'm not gonna try to redownload this game. Yeah the game is decent to play when it bored or if you want to just relax but idk these updates just make it unbearable for me to even play. Ps I'm on a rdmg 8,Negative
"From my personal opinion and experience the best mobile game going. The gameplay is fun, graphics are great, story is very good too. Also runs a lot smoother than Genshin Impact.",Positive
"Honkai is good but There's a map glitch most players has been experiencing where the map is transparent only chest,monsters, characters,and collectable items are visible Please fix this bug in the next update!üôè‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
Hi I'm hope that you respawn immediately I'm just want to say about your game mechanics you know that you're word quest (I can't abuse the sky) the graphics is the best but the enemy its so hard like I repeat the battle 8x it's just I can't solves it and by the way I'm only healer is Natasha she is good but some problem comes ty (hoping that you respond immediately),Positive
"The game was nice, I know it's beta but the floors and walls were gone so it is hard to play. I hope it will be fixed later. oh ya I have downloaded the game for 3 times and it doesn't change the fact that the floor and wall is gone",Negative
"The game is glitching. Missing terrain. Walls disappear and then reappear, floor is missing and when I change camera angle it reappears. Please fix this.",Negative
Can you please fix the bugs on the compatibile mode in the display mode it was alot more smoother and I had to change it into normal mode and its really laggy I wish you would fix the bugs on compatible mode.,Negative
"my account got hacked and they kept rejecting my claims. i e-mailed them two times, i got two tickets, i submitted all the necessary information and they still won't help me get back my account. maybe it's because i haven't used actual money that they didn't look into my reports seriously. very disappointed.",Negative
"I love Turn base RPG from old School to Other Genre that makes Turn base RPG what it is today and I may say this game is well polish from a company that already stablish a strong foundation to Mobile Gaming the rating of stats raging from Animation,Music, Voice acting, environment graphics to character design all are well made fans and new comers can love this beautiful universe looking forward as this game grow like it's mentor game GI and HI3rd.",Positive
"The game is perfect! Sure it can be laggy on phone but for me its worth it. The lore, the gameplay, everything of it its perfect and i love it! Hoyo keep up! I love ur works!",Positive
"I don't know what happened but in this update I can't even play the game, it just keeps crashing my game every time I'm in the game. This hasn't happened before in 1.0 so I don't know what kinda changes you guys did. But this just makes it unplayable so I'm not playing the game until it comes to the ps4",Negative
"As a person who is interested in a good story, this game is absolutely right down my alley. 10/10 gameplay, memorable characters, and consistently updating!",Positive
You know how to make a game fun? Make a turn based battle system but the player never gets any turns. Enemy damage is way too high compared to what your own characters get to do if you don't sink large amounts of dollars and hours into this game. This game was fun at first but recent versions are just a slog.,Negative
Copy paste of Genshin Impact. Kinda disappointing that they make you pay just as much as genshin when half the work was put into it. Dan Heng = Zhongli. Different haircut but still spear user with same attack style and motion. Seeley = Keqing. The ult and her attack style animations are just recycled. Hook = Klee. Same attack style and element if you think about it. All the models just copy pasted with a little tweak here and there. Same currency system for summons....no effort.,Negative
"Update: ""Worst account linking ever!! No more!! I don't have to deal with the accnt linking anymore as now i can use my gmail accnt to log in to Pc!! Best update ever!! (Ver 1.2.) Thank you so much devs!! As for the game. Turn base waifus & husbandos are just my cup of tea! Voice acting are top notch so are OST Cocolia was the most awesome boss fight i've experienced so far as the music is just bangin!! Hoping for more future updates! Looking forward to pull kafka! Tysm again devs!!",Positive
Still the best game for me even though in the update 1.6 I probably wouldn't be able to play since of storage problem. The graphics is good even at the lowest and the story is amazing i even cried to main story TwT.,Positive
"please add a cancel button when using the ultimate üôè, btw everything is perfect. Please keep the current difficulty when fighting enemies, don't go too easy",Positive
"Best turn based rpg gacha game ! Hands down! They are great! Graphics , story, music, animation everything is perfect. Rewards are also very good! & Now in next patch they are giving free 5 star! How can i not love this game & the devs.",Positive
"Average combat, good graphics, absolutely insanely pay to win, horrific rates, banners with units and items so you aren't guaranteed to even get a unit. If they improved the rates, weren't as stingy with currency, and had separate banners for items and units, it would be infinitely better. Either expect to not get any useful characters, or expect to pay money",Negative
"Good story, voice acting, sound effects, stunning art style, gives good rewards as well. One can easily tell the game loves their playerbase.",Positive
This game was awesome to play but I have this problem whenever there is a cutscene it will lag and it make the experience worst event thought my device is quite in the high en. I hope you guys can try fix this issue soon because it's a shame that player can't enjoy the cutscene if it lags.,Positive
"I played Honkai impact 3rd and Genshin impact ever since their release, and I have to say Hoyoverse did not disappoint with Honkai: Star Rail! I love the story and I love the references to their old games, and so many of the characters I know and love from Honkai Impact 3rd are here too! I don't usually like playing turn-based games but I enjoy this one a lot!",Positive
When I started playing I wasn't sure about only have one type of skill. But the streamlining just shift focus more onto team setup. Great game! Amazing cutscenes,Positive
"Another hit from Hoyoverse, this one focused on the honkai universe and with classic RPG gameplay that seems inspired on the persona/smt franchise, the gameplay is nothing too spectacular, but the quality of the story, visuals and music are more than enough to make this game a must play",Positive
"Great start, bad after less than a week.. sadly they micro manage what they allow player to have and will release the game bits by bits.. if you want something to play full time this isn't it.. still a decent gacha to play on the side.. but the lack of Puzzles and activities to do after clearing story is making it hard to stick to the game.",Negative
"This so fun with the amazing graphics, characters, story line. But I played Genshin impact before and I quickly notice it's similar. Btw there is something bugging me a lot now you see I've played Genshin impact a lot... And I'm just bothered that there isn't a jump button.....",Positive
"It's a great game with great graphics and great characters, but when I try playing it, it crashes, I can't tell if it's because I'm on mobile or it's something else but i hope it gets fixed so i can fully enjoy it.",Positive
"Game is really good üòä iam so satisfied with character design,story,cutsceen,no lag problem good work from hoyoverse I also played genshi. Impact but in my device it lag so much and this game also f2p friendly dispite of fact the game has some bug this game is excellent üëå I really recommend this game to give a try A BIG 5/5 FROM MY SIDE",Positive
"impossible play. when cutscenes end, the app reboot device even on low quality configuration (all effects turned off, low quality models and textures). game installation has 7 gb, after installation still free 16 gb. fore example Genshin impact work okay on max quality settings (latest version). 5 start for artwork story and game mechanic (was possible fight training battle) and -4 star for programming. P.S.: think that 5 star reviews is promoting team accounts. betta test was buged but work.",Negative
"The rewards that Star Rail gives are very pleasing, but I find the gameplay boring and repetitive (probably because it's turned based). After you get to endgame, there isn't that much to do.",Negative
"The game is beautiful, but the farming for equipment and materials are horrible. This game is intended for pay to win players. If you are f2p u can play it but at the end game you will evetually hit a brick wall you can't progress, and you can only enjoy the game what? 15 mins a day?",Negative
"Great game for mobile when first introduced, now you need your phone to have 25+ GB of space. I haven't been able to play anymore with updates requiring so much extra space with each new update. Goodbye wasted hours of gameplay.",Negative
"Downloads a gig or 2 every time I open it. Half the time I give up and don't bother playing it because it downloads all the time. Same reason I stopped playing Genshin Impact, I mean come on enough is enough. Surely it doesn't need a gig update every day.",Negative
"I really love this game so much and I am actually addicted to it, it kinda looks like its half of persona 5 and genshin on it and that is why when I played this game my eyes opened wide bro, and the graphics are nice the stories are nice and that is why I give this 5/5 stars and no turning back...RIP storage spaceüòî",Positive
"This game is absolutely insane. Amazing storylines, beautiful character displays and character in depth. Amazing animation quality and very nice repetitive playstyle. Truly a nice game to play and enjoy.",Positive
"The game is good but I am so disappointed. I know the wrap is based on luck but how can you let not loss on Seele banner and even gave me a 5* light cone instead of a character? How useless, how disappointing, I don't feel like playing anymore if things are just like this. You made my luck very very low, I wrapped more than 200 times on standard just to get rubbish? It's not exciting nor enjoying anymore like this.",Positive
"game was good, yea i enjoy play this game back in the day but not for too long... the app keep force closing thinking bout uninstalling if they dont fix the force close and black screen things, please fix the force close issues, i cant finish my quest.",Negative
"I love this game so much, the mc is one of my favourites and the humour is brilliant! Combat is satisfying although maybe adding more fighting moves/poses could make things more interesting to watch? Not really any other suggestions, great game anyhow I definitely recommend:)",Positive
"Great game! Thank you for the generous rewards and a unique turn-based combat system, the character designs is also so good!! Hope many things will come next year!",Positive
"The game looks interesting, but never tried to play it once. I wanna play it so badly but this ""error code 1001_3"" always pop up on my screen whenever I click the ""Click to start"" button. How do I get rid of this problem?",Negative
"This game really has beautiful sceneries, cut scenes, character designs and the voices are just magnificent! Honkai: Star Rail is one of my favorite games! These games are awesome! You can fight, make friends, walk around enjoying scenery and way more! 5 stars",Positive
"The game is very greedy. FTP will be able to receive 1 new limited character every 2 months unless he is super lucky. Behind the beautiful graphics lies boring, routine gameplay, which is multiplied by the greed of the game. Difficult bosses have been introduced into the game; game modes can no longer be completed without an injection of money.",Negative
"Aetherium developer fails to understand that spirit collectors will want to collect all and MAX level all spirits. If normal enemy spirits do not respawn over time, it is impossible go grind enough resources to attain all spirit max level goal. It's great that new ideas and content is being introduced but developers need to research the mentality and goals of players to cater to a more sustainable and Long running content rather than a shortlive wasting effort of spirit designer team.",Negative
"So far, performance is okay but POOR OPTIMIZATION. Yeah it ran smooth but goddamn my hand is burning to the touch. And I have a Snapdragon 860/855+. It ran Genshin at Med 45fps with slight warm. With Honkai Star Rail, 30fps Med gets me HOT HOT HOT surface. So yeah, would give 5 star with better optimization.",Negative
"actually, it's the first game I have been liking for almost a year. there is an interesting plot, colorful characters, beautiful areas. it's perfect, I think.",Positive
"Its really fun, play style is indeed different than their other games, but the mechanics work well. It is much more generous than genshin, dont listen to the other reviews and try it for yourself before making judgement. Honkais storys r amazing, so i feel like this one is also gonna have an amazing story",Positive
"this game is so good oml. im a genshin addict and i stopped playing for a week ist such a good game, and the characters are so cool. the combat is fun and the story is really interessting. i usually hate si-fi games because i find that its best in movies but this game is so good oml, and the gacha system is cool too like i already have 3 5 stars (also pompom is adoreble) 10/10 (edit: ist havent played genshin at allüíÄ starrail is really good)",Positive
I spent hours on this game and stopped playing since my phone was too old to handle it. I recently got a new one and tried to log in to find that my account was nowhere. I tried logging in and it only came up as a new register. I lost everything. I preordered this game so the things i lost i can't recover like the wishes I had been saving up. It killed my motivation to play at all. Ill probably just uninstall at this point.,Negative
"This amazing game is free, I played for a while and never spent a single dollar . Graphics are awesome and the battle system is amazing. I highly recommend üëå",Positive
"This generosity for Stellar Jades is a little lacking but from my experience in playing Honkai Impact 3rd when it comes to farming for gems I'd say Honkai Star Rail Stellar Jades farming is balanced, the only thing that needs to be added is the rerun of every limited character and graphic optimization, it lags and crash sometimes when you put it in the device hold for maximum graphics, may I also suggest outfits for the characters",Positive
"5 stars. Good Quality game, good sound track and good character designs as usual with hoyo. But this game actually gives out actual endgame content, QoL, and rewards that doesn't feel like getting spit on the face despite not being a year in yet.",Positive
"Love the gameplay, story and characters. Game also keeps getting constant updates that add new mechanics, events, characters and further develops the main story.",Positive
"What i like from this game is AMAZING Grafik, Nice character and world designs also great story, nice free character althought all only 4* except MC. What i dislike is English Voice for MC Trailblazer Female is meh kinda sleepy voice compare to male counterpart; Daily Login not in game but in website, thats so meh in many way, and also hard to find Daily Login Link or info about this inside the game, soo meh. and Gacha rate still same in all your game, trash.",Positive
"You know all of those games you see advertised that look so awesome, but when you download them, they aren't anything like advertised? THIS GAME IS THE AWESOME GAME YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR! Great graphics, great game play, great interface, great fighting dynamic, great storyline! ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ",Positive
"Game was fun to play, but it is forcing me to start my progress over after Ipgged on with my goggle account after about a two week absence. I spent well over 100 dollars on this game and I want to have my progress returned. I can't give this game the five stars I planned to when the game does what Punishing Grey Raven does and forces me to start all of my progress over.",Negative
One of the best turn based games I've played I Love it so much. kudos to the Star rail dev team we all appreciate the love you show for the game and it's players. please never change ü•∞ and make This game the absolute best it can be.,Positive
The game is very good. but i removed 3 stars cause -1.this game is not made for android. if you play this game in mobile you will cry. too much lag and very bad graphics -2.very big size around 7gb your mobile will heat too much it will blast. -3.this game should give attention to android players.the game should be improve.the creater should do something this game could be the best game but not for android player. The game size should decrease and low end device player should be able to play.umm,Negative
"Can we also have to delete resources for previous finished quests to save phone storage? I'm having some storage issue, so I'm requesting this, thou the game is running good on my phone but it's just the size for the game. Overall good at everything ngl.",Positive
"Been waiting for this game, and i have beem playing it since release.The game is super fun and satisfying, my favorite turned based game with gacha, the gacha is same as genshin although i seem to get more 5 star than genshin or im just lucky, This game os obviously more generous.The game has an insane graphics but sometimes laggy.Overall its a good game. Please make more content",Positive
"Amazing game! It took many of the feedback that players gave the genshin team and actually implemented them to create a really fun game! While highly controversial, I appreciate the auto-battle for farming and the restricted open world for faster in game loading times and smaller patch file sizes!",Positive
"Games actually pretty fun. The first time i play this game, i thought this is boring because it's a turn based game. But it's actually fun because of the contents inside making this game not boring and the cool characters design too",Positive
"Too many animation and story. I feel little bit bored when i just download it. War must move to other place again and again It's bored actually. Tutorial too long. Developer must watch last season anime about game shangri la. It's war game, open world and enemy only exist when player go to some place. Not when u walk then meet enemy like ur other game (genshin) Also this game take so long to log in üòë Please watch anime about game. So u can improve ur imagination",Negative
"To all the low ratings, yes the game is a turn based game which is how it was advertised. Go play Genshin or Honkai 3rd if you want a action pack game. Yes, the game is demanding for mobile users and you will need a phone that has enough ram and memory to handle this. If you werent aware, the game only became available for play for non-beta players last April 26, 2023. Prior to that it of course will not launch for us. So why a 4, well gatcha salt of course ü§£",Positive
"What happened to the writing in Luofu arc? Really disappointing, especially knowing how much better they *could* have done it. The characters too, it's annoying how stingy resources are when I've got a bunch of units I NEED to build just to progress the game. Giving out some dude I didn't want doesn't suddenly mean I'm going to build around him, I want to have strong units that I like but this is apparently a struggle. Auto-battling as someone I don't like is a real good reason to quit playing",Negative
just like what other say there's a lot of bug I hope they fix it asap so I can save more jades. It was a good and fun game I love the story and I'm waiting for my baby dragon dan heng. might change my rate after they fix the bug love you hoyovers,Negative
It's ve4y fun especially if you have friends to compare with. The community for this game is very big so you'll get all the help you will ever need very easily. Highly recommend. P.S they are very generous when it comes to wishes.,Positive
"Its just not working on my phone, I have an S9+ 64gb so its not a throwaway phone or too outdated, also google says it should be compatible but opening the app I get a black screen. Ive already cleared as much cache and memory as possible, moved all my files and pictures to the SD card. It left me with about 30gb of open memory. Is it still not enough? Its unfortunate its not on PS4 like Genshin therefore I cant get it on console either.",Negative
"I have been playing this game for 7 months, I think this game provides great benefits to players, and it is considered a light mobile game. It is very suitable for people who are busy and don‚Äôt have much time but still want to play games. The story line, character design, and activities are all very interesting. Anyway I like it very much.",Positive
"Great combat system, love the character designs, the graphics, and even how personal and likeable they made the characterizations with things like text conversations. But just like with Genshin Impact, they INSIST on forcing their excessive cutscenes on us and it's infuriating. I've played Genshin since it's launch and every month my tolerance for their cutscene nonsense diminishes more and more. At this point, I can see they don't respect me or my limited time. It's unacceptable.",Negative
"Decent turn based game, however there's Backbone support on iOS, why isn't there the same support for that android version? It's 2023 now...developers need to add customizable controls into their games or at least leave it open for players to edit that via settings for themselves.",Negative
"ADDICTIVE I downloaded this game at 1am on a whim and started to play. it is now 5:46 am, and i haven't slept because i literally cannot stop. Theres always something to do and the game looks amazing. It looks so good im suprised my phone doesnt get hot playing it. And i have an android so that means alot. 8.5/10 definitely give it a try.",Positive
for consuming so much data while idle playing ... it consumes so much data even after downloading 9 GB worth of content. It consumed 3 GB of data in 1 ¬Ω hour which is honestly ridiculous as it uses simpler mechanics. Despite that game is very nice and it'll be much better if you resolve this problem soon.,Positive
"It's really good and I like the story better than genshin impact. It seriously lacks content like there is nothing to do except fight, it's getting boring I don't think I can see myself playing everyday",Positive
"Amazing, thats all i can say to the -so far- well written story. The gameplay is very fine just like the classic old turn base rpg style with impressive graphic quality upgrade. Good job!",Positive
"Don't get me wrong, it's a good game. But open world doesn't work on mobile. At least mine. It wants to burn up my phone so bad that it feels like at times I could cook an egg on my screen. If they could make these games available on console, I would make it a four star rating.",Negative
"In the girlie most powerful than me. You keep killing me so I quit. I delete so. It's not easier, it's getting harder and harder. I played this night and morning and I get price but I keep dying. I try my yes so I don't like it a little bit",Positive
Best free to play game it has excellent rewards and unique characters :0 I love the character designs and the story it's good and it's more easy to play for beginners it's a little bit grindy,Positive
Just easily top 5 gachas of all time to be honest....nice rewards and good story...with deep characters and events. The lore goes insane ...just don't want them to get complacent with their game's success and work harder with each update is my suggestion. Thanks for reading.,Positive
"Very great overall gameplay and storyline, art and everything is all great from my perspective. Works exactly as the others same-made in-game. Preferred it.",Positive
My favorite game since release. It's very kind to f2p players and the combat is pretty fun. I used to dislike turn-based games but that quickly changed when I started playing HSR.,Positive
"Game mechanics get really repetitive after a while. Story has problems with pacing that seems rushed, and some plot points are unclear and inconsistent. Female characters look the same and boring. RNG in farming is also very bad, which makes the game tiring.",Negative
"I LOVE IT SO MUCH. the story is engaging and fun, the mechanics are easy to understand but still challenging in some aspects, the characters are unique and interesting and the developers give high quality rewards making the game easily not a pay to win scam. L + Dr. Ratio to all other gacha games, HSR wins in all aspects",Positive
Game is fun and super fun my issue right now is the drop rates for the calyx. I can barely feel difference in drop rates between stage V and stage VI calyx and see no point in the stage VI calyx. Its jjst there to make us hope that our grind will get better but it did not.,Positive
Pretty fun way to spend spare time as I love turn based combat. There is a diverse list of game modes and characters.,Positive
"One of the best turn based gacha rpg out there. The graphics is great, free to pay friendly. You can farm the gems to summon 5 star characters, 5 star characters are guaranteed within 90 pull. Great story line, music and voice acting. English dub is good, and also the Japanese dub is good if you like anime.",Positive
Even update after update..the game keep kick me out.on patch running (not even running..0% then its force close)..sad..maybe i should uninstall it and then install it again.if the same maybe say goodbye to this game.. Edit : finally after re installing a can play the game again.,Positive
Having fun with the game honestly more then genshin impact just waiting for the playstation release because I'm not really a mobile gamer and most times games like this can't really run on phones because it starts to overheat the fan and make its pretty hard to hold it while playing it but I'm still enjoying it playstation hype,Positive
Blah blah blah blah it takes like 20-30 min to load recourse anyhow after one time u complete the pain it will be fast.....and that's a great news whatever..... After u open the game u will be SHOCKED because that looks SOOOOO GOOD and the story is also SOOOOO GOOD and that's the reason I give 4 star but I like this game Bye and thanks for reading this I gotta play this gameüëãüèª(and I know it's not my net problem to be sooo slow at loading recourseüíÄ),Positive
"Surprisingly has a good story for a turn based mobile game, also it has semi-open world map for you to explore. Gacha rate is acceptable with pity system that's works the same as their previous game except for limited light cone (weapon) banner that has 75/25 rate.",Positive
"Love the game. Great story, beautiful graphics, awesome characters. Unfortunately had to uninstall cause just to heavy on storage. Had no space. Otherwise awesome.",Positive
I love what the company is doing for the game I see it going in the right direction and I feel like the devs actually listen to the community and play their own game. With every patch the game becomes better and better also the characters are awesome and the story is awesome and not bloated with unnecessary dialogue unlike genshin,Positive
"Great game, I'll give it 5 ‚≠ê if there's a balance between each path. Some characters really need to be revamped or buffed at least, like Herta and Arlan.",Positive
GAMES DEAD NEEDS MORE CONTENT game is super fun and exciting building a good team is rly fun the game is super generous on giving you points to summon but only thing is the game is at a dead end and needs content BADDDDDDLY you get to the end of the story which doesent take long in about 2 days if playing nonstop only to find out theres LITERALLY nothing else to do,Negative
Better than GI.honkai Star rail always give 10pull in every patch and act faster according to the player's request such as energy from 180 to 240. no less they optimize when the character is running without being disturbed when changing characters.,Positive
"the game is good , but not good enough .... well atleast it's better than genchin impact .... I guess!? still not comparison with the greatest mobile game I ever played ""Call Of Duty Mobile"" it's a way far to consider it ""mobile game"" with peak graphics and smooth gameplay that's what we need as a player's A SMOOTH GAMEPLAY WITH A GOOD GRAPHICS TH√ÄT WHAT EVERY GAMER DREAM ABOUT IT FOR MOBILE GAMES NOW SAY MY NAME üòå",Positive
"Was so excited to begin the game after launched, but how cruellest the game was, I have met for several times where login error occurred. Error Code 1001-2... Am I the only one who have this problems? My device is Honor 20 Pro comes with 8gb ram, 256gb rom... In which I'm able to play genshin with these device setup but not this Honkai Star Rail.... üôÑ",Negative
Really emersive. I think it's nice to play whether you want to relax or you want a thrilling fight. The Storyline is immaculate....as well as the lore behind it all.,Positive
"I've been playing this game since it release, The game is not very hard to grind like genshin impact, I feel the gacha in HSR is much easier than genshin, also the rewards is, the game is fast-paced than genshin, the only annoying is the dialogue of the story which is so many and so long than the action in the story, that's the only Hoyoverse design but I enjoy so far.",Positive
"While this game is really fun, it has extreme lag and tends to crash when I play it on my phone. It didn't do this when it first released. I really love this game but it makes me sad that I can't play it. Please try to fix this. I don't see why I should be able to work Genshin just fine but not Star Rail. Please and thank you.",Negative
"imo, one of the best turn based games out there, it's pretty f2p friendly, there's some good quality of life, the characters are amazing, and the ""open world"" is super beautiful",Positive
"0/10. didnt even let me load into the game, stayed in this loading screen with a train driving past a moon and it repeatedly kept asking me to log in and start the game when it wouldnt even load. i had high hopes for this game. you post events that i cant even get into because of how much lag this game has. do not recommend for some of those android users.",Negative
"the game is very fun to play, beautiful art and wonderful story quest and side quest. the backstories of the character are also intriguing.",Positive
Game is good but crashes sometimes. The in-app purchases are bit more expensive than it should be. If they are made cheaper then it would be fantastic game.,Negative
"Im really like this game. BUT the problem this game after predonwload, there have another donwloading resources after new patch maintenance like 1 -2 gb. That's like the whole another game resources, i mean im okay if 200-500mb after maintenance but its whole new resources like WTH!!!",Positive
"5/5 Love all the visual, sound, narrative, details, the ability to auto-battle, the reduced likelihood for me to get dizzy when playing, and thank you for the Dr. Ratio.",Positive
"A very fun game, a lot of gameplay, a little difficult and good characters. Overall extremely fun and a little challenging.",Positive
"So, i pre installed this game before it came out and i was VERY happy with it. But i had to uninstall it because i was stuck in a battle and couldn't get pass it, plus i loose my motivation quick. But with Kafka's banner i am reloading it. Wish me luck",Positive
"I used to play that game, I used money too, and I need to stay away a few months from the game, and my account was gone, no way to get back, nobody to contact, rubbish support, if you guys are planning to put money don't do it, because the support sucks, is just a waste of money.",Negative
I love this game and the style they use its also has a very well made storyline its fun to adventure around do gacha pulls to get new characters the leveling system is nice too‚ú®Ô∏è i think the best part is the aoe in fights so ye its a 5 star for me in my opinion!!,Positive
"The app is the worst. It takes the longest time to download and also you have to stay on the app to let it finish downloading. Like for example, I was waiting for it to download and my friend had texted me. Once I got back on the app it completely restarted my downloading of the game.",Negative
"Couldn't get into genshin impact. They somehow managed to hook me in within the first 10 minutes of gameplay. Now I look forward to playing it every day just because it's fun and well, the girls are cute. But it is actually really fun",Positive
"Game itself is outstanding and the quests were scripted very well, the dialogue etc. Graphics enough for mobile. Really interesting game with lots of hidden easter eggs. Overall 9/10 execution.",Positive
The game is good I downloaded it off tic tok but my only problem is I was promised 80 free pulls from downloading it off the add I seen and that promise has not been fulfilled. I enjoy playing the game so I will continue to play but I would still like my 80 free pulls,Negative
Super Fun!!! I have played Honkai Impact 3rd for a long time and beta tested Honkai Star Rail. I am glad I decided to pursue this game. So far the story is wonderful and I love turn-based game. Really glad they span out on gameplay to give more variety.,Positive
Love the game but anyone else having trouble with the data consumption? I'm a student and I cannot afford to keep purchasing data every hour or so! Genshin has a larger file size but still doesn't consume as much while playing.,Positive
"The latest Aetherium Wars event was way too difficult for people who simply want to get the event done and not care about it. As much as I appreciate the introduction of new mini games in events, it's unfair to make them too difficult and therefore unintentionally gatekeep those disinterested players from the rewards provided by the said events.",Negative
Playing this since day one .... it's pretty casual i can while while working.,Positive
Just another typical gotcha game The only difference here is the material required to be able to get characters if you and far between then in addition they have a campaign going on where they are posting ads saying that there is 80 free pulls This is a completely false statement I strongly advise against buying into their ads as they are blatant lies that take advantage of other people's incompetence If you enjoy playing this game then by all means but just be warned that the ads are lies,Negative
Good game overall but i hope they can optimized the game a little bit better,Positive
Excellent story and charismatic characters. „Éõ„Çø„É´„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„ÇíËøé„Åà„Çà„ÅÜ,Positive
"Its great, but in some cases in glitches out. Like for example, a building is glitching and it's not even part of the game.",Negative
"The best adventure rpg turn based in the world 2024. Many mini games, UI friendly, cool story and characters design.",Positive
"In one word, wonderful, keep it up, I thank you and your respected staff for this enjoyable experience, respect for the player can be seen everywhere in the game, unlike some games, I hope to see the progress of the game in the future updates and to enjoy this enjoyable experience for several years, and this game has a lot of potential for improvement, Good luck üòâ",Positive
"A good game with bad community management, it literally unbearable how they split the community and encouraging hatred towards other, everywhere I go is literally XXXX COULD NEVER, HSR become a standard for the elitist just because there's a free 5 star and tons of free pulls, it breeding on the spoiled community ended up ruining the whole market, making it giving free stuff is a standard. Which is a toxic behaviour for the generation to come, they will never appreciate efforts for achievements.",Negative
Good game with amazing story ost and graphics but there's still ALOT of bug and error specially 1001_01-1001_05 and because of it many player including me cannot log into the game right now so until it is fixe i cannot give more than one star I'm hoping for a fast response Edit: they fixed it yay :D,Positive
"Aite broke my 50/50 losing streak, ty. Also got queen(firefly) uber early too. Jk lost 50/50 gain gg.",Negative
"In all my years of playing mobile games. I've never experienced FPS drop so damn bad, yall made Genshin look like it was child's play and that game beat Honkai in sheer mass. So why can't it be the same for this game if not close, My phone should be powerful enough to run it on high settings with ease, guys this is just bad. Yall gonna need to give this game some thorough optimization if it's gonna run at least close to good as Genshin Impact can",Negative
Playing Honkai:Star Rail from the first day and honestly i have really experienced such a great pleasure for playing this game.This game's mechanics are way easier to understand.Most of the people who played honkai impact 3rd will definitely love this game as the characters are exact the same just the designs are a bit different.Maybe this game is not everyone's taste but they should give it a try and don't leave it in the first half.,Positive
"I love how the animation goes smoothly and well done. I also love the character designs, it's a very good game. But I dont really like of how the adventure is too many. But it's worth it.",Positive
"""Esse est percipi..."" Wait, how did it get there? No matter. The game's undeniably addictive‚Äîmy source of dopamine and endorphin, no kidding. The burst animation's spectacular, and without a doubt, the lore is just as the same. An ace, I'll say. I'm quite fond of this game, like any other. ""Well done... ten points."" - Dr. Ratio",Positive
So far good but i think to get 5 star heroes is difficult:(,Positive
"I really love this game, so hyped for it and still enjoying playing it. But I realized that this game is draining my mobile data too fast (playing on mobile), unlike genshin even when I played genshin for hours. I don't know if it's just me or the other mobile player experiencing this issue too.",Negative
"It's a really amazing game and I was enjoying it until 2.0, after 2.0 the game just keeps crashing every single time I try to open it. Hope the devs can solve this issue cause I really like the game",Positive
"This game is extremely extertaining and a nice cool off after a long day of school and or work. The only downsides is no ""Joining people's world"" kinda Multi-Player like in genshin but that doesn't make the game less enjoyable! I highly recommend this game to anyone who has free time and enjoys Honkai Impact the 3rd or Genshin impact",Positive
"Fix the RNG, i pulled 80+ for acheron and still don't have it and now i couldn't get her because it'll end in a minute",Negative
Good game best rpg the problem is. it take to much storage like bro some people are having trublesome with 64gb Even me i delete all my games now i have 1 game it's hrs like fr i will quit cus I'm poor to buy new phone,Negative
HOYOVERSE PUT RYTYHM GAME EVENT IN HONKAI STAR RAIL!!! we can CO-OP for Points!!!! trailblazer got invited to test silverwolf game. TURNS out silverwolf is fighting with herta on who can make THE BEST rythym GAME! and so so Theres two style of rythym game you can add AND MORE POPULARITY PWEASE... it AN oppurtunity TO MAKE NEW SONG AND ATTRACT MORE PLAYERS!! and also screwlum i forgot about him. PUT HIM TOO. make it PERMANENT PWEASEEE,Positive
"Very cool, I'm new to and very bad at turn based games, the tutorial was easy and overall very good Edit: It has been a year since last review and it's still going strong",Positive
"Like Honkai Impact but a bit simpler. The story is stunning but the action part is not as good as Honkai Impact. Most of the game includes story and the action part takes less place. On the other hand, small jokes like Fight club quote is amazing. I missed the first rule as well :)",Positive
"A new tale with plenty of potential! Fun, turn-based gameplay with awesome sound design and visuals. I'm looking forward to what unfolds",Positive
"I only leave the game for a few week and when I logged in again with the same account, I don't know why but suddenly it start with a new game instead start with my lvl 50 acc. I never reset the data game nor I delete the game, I hope hoyoverse can help me recover my account lvl 50",Negative
"Good Story, Amazing Graphics, Clean Char Design. And, A FREE GIFT",Positive
"Overall experience is fine. The riddle daily made me rage for giving me a non math related math problem, then calling me dumb for not selecting the other correct response (you give me flowers of the 4 season, I'm gonna say 365), and it's time gated... so I'm knocking off 2.5-3 stars for that.",Negative
"Fun, funny, and beautiful at first. But the word ""travel"" is annoying. I loved Genshin in the first phase: Outdoors, environments, good story. Bad End game content without money üí∞. Honkai comes off as free to play friendly, but, I'd need to be paid play Honkai as a part time job, not me paying them. Oh well. Was fun, but.",Negative
Your relic 3x aniversary is hot garbage. Jesus Christ all I got was all garbage and not getting any good stuff.. I'm done relic farming my god it's frustrating.. How the relic farming is so bad.. Goodbye,Negative
"It's a turn based game, which I personally enjoy, but some people find it boring quickly after you need to farm for your character since it's very tedious.",Positive
"I don't know is it just me or some other people too,i can't enter the game like I've tried multiple times from other accounts too but the issue is same (error code_1001) but the game runs on my other smartphone which is basically a medium spec smartphone but not on my main phone which is a full fledged gaming phone. And even if i do get in ( which happend once) i can play normally but when i try to login the same error pops I'll keep the game on my phone just in case so please hoyo fix the game",Negative
"50-50 should not be a thing. You grind all those gems, just to get absolutely nothing. No instead, you Himeko on each different sccount you make, one of the weakest characters in the entire game. I simply just gave up with this game. No skip features for tutorials or story either so everytime you wanna make a new account, you have to sit through hours of non stop tapping your screen over and over, and it just barely makes the story faster. Honkai Impact has a skip button, why not HSR?!",Negative
"Its dissapointing that I want to play in PC but the unity error keeps happening each time I try to log in, some players say they had to wait for an update for it to get fixed by I've been trying since 1.5 and its still there, what do I do. I wont change my review unless its fixed.",Negative
Why not just say its all talk with a little fighting..I've never been so bored ..mind numbing bored..would recommend black clover m ..much better and less talking,Negative
I love the game and characters so much,Positive
Not working at all even after downloading completely Waste of time,Negative
"Great game overall, the story is amazing as you can choose your own path unlike other hoyoverse games so far. The gacha seems bad at first but once i study it it seems better than the others with the standard banner pity system and the light cone banner having continuous pity. Great game! I'll be waiting for more improvements",Positive
Decent game. Loved the turn based. But it does not allow rerolling and I'm not starting the game without trying to get someone I like. I just don't want to play it that much. Bricked my main account before I figured this out. Shame. Don't be greedy.,Negative
I really want to like this game but as a casual player that has barely anytime to grind they really did the best to make it more miserable by making bosses even harder,Negative
"Didn't actually get to try the game! As I was trying to registered, whenever I went away from the app, to retrieve the verification code, it could close out to the beginning reinitiating the registration process. Guess I won't play then?",Negative
"I am in the early game and regular enemies are obliterating my team and I have no way to get more materials to level them up, so I'm stuck in the story. Until a balance change is implemented I won't be playing other than logging in. When this is changed I will update my review",Negative
"(mobile,a year back)it keeps throwing me out of the game and it keeps giving me loading errors otherwise is a great game (pc)as long as you don't mind playing turn based then it's a very fun and pretty game",Positive
"I honestly feel that this game is the BEST f2p game out there, I know about genshin and played it, I think this is better (my opinion of course!) Hsr gives me more luck and way more wishessss!! (Gacha addict üòî‚úåÔ∏è) and it's easier, you take turns in battles!! Like what!? 10/10 would recommend.",Positive
I have been waiting so long for a polished turn based game and hoyo has done it. This game is simply fantastic. A very well voice acted and beautiful game. I am super excited for the updates to this game. If it's anything like Genshin we are in for a good time. Thank you Hoyo!,Positive
"If you love Genshin Impact, then you will love this! This is no hack and slash, this is a turned based game! Great game, awesome graphics, touching storyline! Can't wait for the console release later this year!",Positive
"Awesome Game! The high quality was wild! Felt like it was real well playing the game, cool characters with great designs in my opinion. The opponents may be scary but holy cow defeating them while they're level is higher than me is scary! Awesome game!",Positive
"Literally during sign up there's even pop up ads. I wasn't even half way through entering a verification code or setting up a password and I had 2 ads. If I haven't even signed up yet and I'm getting pop ups, I'm out!",Negative
"Great game, great story, great characters. Hilarious dialogue and a crew you genuinely want to befriend. And challenging turn-based combat. What's not to love?",Positive
"To the game developer, there are times I need to quit the virtual world and continue my business in the living world. It's called get a life. Would you mind providing us with a skip button? No point forcing people to go through your stories if they don't want to.",Negative
Completely justified for all the awards it has got this year . A completely free to play game and if you like turn based games or even RPGs this is a proper heaven. Trust me and play it and I assure you that you won't regret.,Positive
Did you have to do firefly like that like LIKE WHY!!! I used to like it,Negative
"First of all, this game needs an A-okay phone to work normally, though I would still prefer low graphics due to my device overheating, good game, good events, and good gambling mechanics for all you gamblers out there. FUN FACT: 99% OF GAMBLERS QUIT BEFORE THEY HIT A GOLDEN TICKET TO WAIFU LAND!!",Positive
"As expected from miHoYo, a high quality gacha game with an imersive story line. You will not regret playing this game as the characters are very well writen and are awesome to play as. For the gacha, the pull animation is also very well done. And the best part is, the main character is a really good tank!",Positive
"Game is getting better with each updates. More QoL improvements and etc. Generous for f2p as well with each updates handing out around 80-100 pulls. Totally enjoying the pace, story updates more or less same pace with Genshin. It's been a great experience so far!",Positive
Great game but it really needs a feature to delete old quests like Genshin. The app is starting to become too large too fast,Positive
The most beautiful graphic turn-based game.,Positive
TOTALLY BIASED AGAINST MALES I love the game but recently I didn't know what devs are thinking. If they wanted Waifu only game why put males at this point,Negative
"I downloaded this game the same time it was released and after downloading and opening the game I was disappointed because it was a turn-based game that's why I deleted it because I was not a fan of turn-based games. But after a month I decided to give another try and now i'm enjoying it a lot but not as much as genshin impact, but overall it's an amazing game",Positive
Still a great game but now it's like a 9/10 still great big not as great as I use to remember,Positive
It's a great game! But the most recent update took too much storage. I can't wait to have a device that has the storage. I'll definitely play again!,Positive
"I really really appreciate playing this game so much! The reason why I started playing this game cause of its character design, voice acting, building architecture, and its beautiful close world.",Positive
nice one but the gameplay is not my type but still looks fun update: omg this game is so good,Positive
"they fixed some of the bugs i encountered so i changed my rating of the game. the game is very easy to learn and understand. all of the qol changes you want in genshin is in this game idk why they don't implement it in genshin too. overall, the game is very fun and enjoyable.",Positive
Finally got past the loading screen and got the chance to play for a bit. I'm still in the beginning but the game has been nice so far. I just wish there was a jump button. I love hopping around,Positive
I really missed playing a turn-base gameplay (where generation this days doesn't know what kind of gameplay is that). the design of the area and the characters are so stunning.,Positive
I love turn based games and the visuals on this game are stunning. The story is engaging too so I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.,Positive
A little bit of a rant here Holy god whos idea or develop the level system on the enemy . when its the end of 1.1 i just level up to 60 ( account) and when i see the enemy its level 76+ some of my character is level 70 and not even max out dont even talk about how expensive it is to get here now am very slowly leveling one character to 80 and a healer to 70 max out Am just a f2p player,Negative
I see honkai I like. Wish they didn't genshinify the UI design though. The combat being turn based is unique but also pretty boring sometimes. Hoping to see more honkai expys in the future,Positive
So far so good. Feels coming back to childhood again because of the some classic features of FF game during PS 1 and 2 era. Anyway. My whole team is 4* and still thriving. üòä,Positive
"For some reason when I first installed the game and whenever I started it,it always says 'Error 1001_3' what does that mean? But still tho the game is super cool and the graphics are amazing! Overall 3/5 would recommend",Negative
"Loving it, but i wish there was the option to play mouse and keyboard when i plug them in. I play on an S23 Ultra, the game is beautiful so i play it on a monitor. But only the mouse can be used so far.",Positive
"10 minutes into the game loading screen started lagging and after I try to start game a error occured regarding error 1001_3 I tried to search for solutions and followed but still didn't work. Please fix this devs I was looking forward when it was released, this got me disappointed",Negative
"Graphic alone can't save what essentially is GI but characters are one-trick pony (main atk, pure support, defender) and half of their viable ""synergies"" require 10hrs+ of rerolling; pulling for worthless nft-looking garbages (light cone) or some generic neo-esque """"characters"""" featuring a whopping 3 - 5 animations, less than 25 VC at the same 180USD price tag; or read the ""trendy"" storyline; or engage in the totally exciting combat where you have 3 moves to choose from (essentially one lol).",Negative
Whatever the F is wrong with the 1.3-updates man?? Some players including me still can't get past the login screen (train just floating in space not going anywhere) Already tried installing & consuming so much data along the retries!,Negative
Pretty fun. I like the game features aren't shoved at you all at once and more things get unlocked as you progress in the story. Pretty good animation too,Positive
"A turn-based JRPG like game, and blast and easy fun game to enjoy. Exploration environment like 'Persona', with upgrading gears and leveling characters.",Positive
"don't play any games from this developer it is damn near impossible to move save data between Mobile, PC, or console and if you slip up at all you can't transfer your account I've been trying for the past 2 hours to put my mobile account onto PS5 and I'm just not allowed to why isn't there just a button to unlink it",Negative
"I love the game , but after 1.3 update it keeps lagging and i'm stuck in the loading screen . Its been 2 days so i can't play it . ü•≤ü•≤ please quickly fix it , i really want to play it üòîüòî",Negative
"HSR has classic turn based combat reminiscent of old ATB party RPGs. The game is well polished, runs well on my phone, and the music is phenomenal.",Positive
Whoever wrote the object interaction texts deserve a promotion and a raise. Amazing. I love this game. (yeah yeah the gameplay story music visual and voice acting are great and fun too),Positive
"Game animations are soo good, Heroes are good, Interface is good too. But fight it's dope, it's like classic card game... No free movements in a fight making more of boring than intersting.",Negative
All of them is enjoyable but i can't seem to log in and when it was loading screen while im download the data and half of them are finished i always get kicked out by the game and return to the home screen whenever the data i was downloading is finished please fix this,Positive
Fix the lagging! My phone is oppo Reno 3 pro... Genshin works very fine on my phone on low graphics but this game lags so much i can't even move my character around... I did try changing graphics settings to normal and putting graphics on very low still it lags alot,Negative
"Loving how they develop this game.. and how they update it.. please continue to give more string characters, also if there will be event to bring back old characters as an event or to purchase or exchange that will be great on the new players",Positive
"Still horrible rates, can't really look around because I use the right side of the screen so it constantly changes my characters and you figure by now they learn to put a skip button for story. No I don't want to watch it first then skip it.",Negative
"Cutscenes cause the game to crash on my device. I'm using Redmagic 8 pro, snapdragon 8gen2 so in term of raw power it should be fine. I'm guessing it's due to bugs. Different GPU requires different tuning. I tried this on my other device Oppo Find X2, snapdragon 865, the cutscenes runs flawlessly. Please fix this issue. Game overall is fine just as usual mihoyo is being stingy with the gacha currencies just like genshin. Advice to devs, be more generous if you want many more people to spend.",Negative
"Im having trouble while fighting argenti in his early quest because the fps always drop and then the game crashes making me unable to complete a thing. Mind you that the other game content are not like this, only argenti.",Negative
"I have good internet connection but it sometimes just disconnect from the server or have error in logging in. Edit: I tried deleting the game and installing it again to see if it will be fixed. Now, I can't even open my account anymore üôÉ",Negative
Character style and lore and as well as details are very high quality. Love the physics and as well as the idea of a train being a main point to explore different places with.,Positive
This game is amazing but the thing is it takes up a lot of space even when I have little amount of apps on my phone so its a bit laggy.The graphics are amazing though.,Positive
"Good game, but not enough to do. Once you complete main mission everything costs 'time' currency and it makes levelling characters hard.",Negative
So far so good I really enjoy this game. Haven't put it done since I downloaded. It's good to come across a good turn based game with a good story and interesting characters. Very nostalgic.,Positive
"I like this game, but it's VERY laggy. Like, cutscenes are going at 5 fps, and sound is lagging too cause of this... Like, my phone is powerful enough to play pubg mobile at max graphics without lags, pleas do something with it...",Positive
i can log in to the game after update,Negative
So far I'm addicted to this game. The story is good and combat is decent for turn based rpg. Big plus is so far it doesn't take a huge impact on storage on my phone unlike a certain other games impact. Very f2p friendly also.,Positive
"It's very good tbh, i love the story, characters, and much more. I like that it's f2p friendly! The reason i chose 4 stars is that it's too laggy and buggy, i used Natasha's skill, and for no reason, it blinded my eyes.. But cool game, i recommend.",Positive
"alright, it's all good now. I have no complain nor critique or some kind of that. Really good game with a good humor(The mc of da game love trash can. I'm not lying) and the graphic, gawd zamn! It's good, and finally.. YOU CAN CUSTOM YOUR RELIC!!!! And it's totally free 100% Truly a good game 10/10",Positive
"since new update game keeps hanging whenver i play, i have to kee closing and opening the game and losing my fighting progress. FIX NOW. not fun to have to keep doing the same thing over and over.",Negative
"Penacony 2.1 is peak, I can't wait until Robin, Firefly, then Jade to blow my jades.",Positive
"Seems like has good potential. Hopefully dont turn out to be like genshin Also, world3 is way too difficult. And the idea of world difficulties bcoming harder as trailblaze lvl is increased, is good. But... Wayyyy too inproportionate. Enemies are too difficult Tho im lvl 35 trail blaze, use charac they r weak against, and lvl 50 w good stats",Positive
"10/10 great game - very happy with the turn base combat and the game as a whole. I could go more into detail, but I'd write a 10 hour paragraph haha.",Positive
‚ù§Ô∏è recently having a lot of bugs!üò≠ Sometime the app crashed by itself and come to the homescreen. Also in aetherium wars event I can't see the signs. I love this game ...plz fix these ü•∫üíï,Positive
I could even play the game and it took over an hour to load ran so slow I couldn't get off the first screen never got to play it was the worst experience I've had with any game hands down I don't know how anyone plays it and it's not the Internet I have 1 gig Internet,Negative
Its pretty good i like turn based games i played all the persona series so overall i love it people say its horrible its clearly not they havent adapted to the game yet in all honesty its 9.5/10 what makes it 9.5? The thing is theres no jump feature and coop overall great amqzing game as usual i can see clearly its inspired by the persona series,Positive
"The game is good, pom pom is cute and I want to protecc him but there's one thing that upsets me and it is connection issues I can barely login and when I login it disconnect me and the game restard completely some part of them is because of my region because I'm an Iranian I sincerely appreciate that your servers are open SOMETIME for us to use even though there's no much in it for you guys and my another personal opinion is on the game concept about readable stuff it is kinda a bit annoying-",Positive
Turn base battle system!! Bring back memories FF series with better graphic. nice storyline. nice background music. not to much mission at 1time. very good game to play without rushing.,Positive
"Amazing game! Great for f2p players and hoyoverse is very generous to honkai players! Its only been 2 days and i already have 15 characters plus two 5 stars ,and i love the story so far!",Positive
"I dare to say this may be the best graphic for an anime turn-based available for mobile, PC and console. Story is great, looking forward to future content",Positive
"Simply a good game, good story, great characters, I love turn based games so it's a plus for me the fighting mechanic is very fun. AND THE DEVS ARE AMAZING THANK YOU DEVS FOR DR RATIO!",Positive
Fix your bug that is really annoying Sometimes stuck at loading screen Sometimes can't enter the game just blank black screen until i close app many time.. i think this is cuz need update but no update there Don't tell my bad device or internet i have no problem with that,Negative
"This game is really good! The only problem is the loading screen when you open the app is litterally taking so long, like it really takes so long to load. I hope you can fix this but overall good game :]. *Nevermind, the game litterally lag so bad that my phone lag out for 10 minutes.*",Negative
"Completely and utterly captivated by this new release. Genshin, but solo rpg for majority, engrossing cast, story, animation, 6 days in and still driven forward. The best game of 23, hands down.",Positive
"Absolutely amazing game! Rewards are generous, content is easy to clear, chracters are likeable and well designed. Easter eggs are hilarious. Would absolutely recommend.",Positive
"I will give 3 star right now, because there is a bug, it is just like, when a special skill will already to use, you can't click the enemy it made the game stop from interacting.. I exit and go back to the same stage but still it is still the same problem",Negative
"Generally speaking, everything is so damn good in this game. The graphics, the visuals, the voice acting, JUST everything.",Positive
50/50 should be illegal. I lost every single one. 180 pity isn't fun.,Negative
"I love this game a lot, but I kinda wished it had co-op like in genshin-..BUT STILL THIS GAME IS WONDERFUL",Positive
Absolute powercreeping my old dps characters like seele became inferior compared to the newer releases despite being invested heavily. Disappointed with the current trajectory of how the balancing works,Negative
Look its a great game. Fixes all the main issues with gi nearly. Playable on a phone. Gacha rates terrible of course but it wont change that. Dont play unless you can spend money on it.,Positive
This game is a lot of fun and more I wish there was more games like this in the future like genshin,Positive
"These devs are braindead. They just want your money. I have not received any help for my login issues. It both doesn't let me create an account bc my email is in use, or it's saying my email doesn't exist.All this and the customer support is useless. Do not recommend. They won't compensate me and now I've missed the launch bonuses. Greedy chinese devs smh. LTG now hoyoverse and star rail",Negative
"This game is the best!! Mann, I regretted choosing the male MC. Hoyo pls give me some kind of a token to switch the trailblazer's gender !!! üò≠",Positive
"This game is super FUN and ENJOYABLE but us mobile players have a big issue, on some devices our graphics are glitching even if we're playing at the lowest graphics settings possible(hopefully u guys fix this as soon as possible and for us to have a better expirience in game)Thank You and i hope u guys read this(i'll rate this 5 star if u guys do)",Negative
Uhm. I think the floor are invisible the train too on the main menu I think it's a bug or it's just my phone hmmm last year when the game released it was ok but now it's no hmmm....... weird I think my phone can't handle this game anymore üò°üò°üò°üòîüòîüòî üé∂KILLING ME SLOWLY WITH HIS SONGüé∂ TELLING MY WHOLE LIFE WITH HIS WORDSüé∂KILING ME SLOWLY... WITH HIS SONG üé∂,Negative
"Worked nice except for the fact the files u download in the game now are over 50 gb which is basically my entire phone space. And because u cant put it on an external sd, the only option is to get a new phone, which im not doing. Time to update pc....tho this way ill spend less money",Negative
"Not the love at first sight I've experienced with genshin but it's actually a good game. I have a suggestion, I really hope we can play coop or multiplayer just like genshin. In this game we can't play coop or even chat with our friends. Really hoping for coop really soon :)",Positive
"I think its okay, but the gameplay is like idk similar to old game pixel pokemon where u can roam around using your character then when u meet an enemy you will duel them instead of fighting them up close, kinda lame for me high graphics and resolution but the gameplay is that simple? Lol",Negative
"This game is good but why this games story can't go forward whenever I watch the story What happens then is the problem and the story doesn't run anymore, instead the app is closing, please fix this bug",Negative
Story Focused TurnbaseRPG I lilke on how the Flow and Progress of the Game Graphics and Other aspect of the game from Sound and voice acting is Amazing my only concern will be the Whole game will burn you out because there is no Sweep or even a Skip mechanic on daily Grind in-game hope it will be implemented in future updates so this can save lots of Time playing daily and saving lots of time for people that have Work and School time overall a Great change of phase from ActionRPG to TurnbaseRPG.,Positive
"Good game. However, the speed to power up character is annoyingly slow. Rng rate to obtain trace mats and relic with rng stats make progress feel abyssmal when you play.",Positive
It's becoming more space consuming day by day .. very unfortunate to see .. after that 75 mb update game is already taking 7 GB extra space ... And still I have to download another of 5 gb ... What stuff you r adding... I already enjoy this game a lot ... I don't think it doesn't require anything extra now ü•ö,Negative
Ok the game was great I like the character design and story and everything but you really messed up with the combat system why the heck is it turn based üò≠ but besides that it's a great game tho I hate turn based games so ima have to un install,Negative
"great game, I had no major issues with the game so far! I really enjoy the story, graphics and the character design. Trash cans for life!",Positive
"4star now, I was expecting it to be like genshin impact. Any ways I dont know why but may net speed is great but on the game its always over 100ping so I always lag. But the game it self it awesome and nice. Really waiting for this to be hype and devs please give us more in future. Will continue to play the game until it satisfies me.",Positive
"This game is SO COOL! Storyline is great, emotional and memorable to me as a player. But more importantly, MC KIT LITERALLY OP THAN ALL OF LUMINE AND AETHER KITS LMAO, AND THE MC ISN'T MUTE, IMAGINE HAVING MUTE MC IN GENSHIN AND PAIMON BEING ANNOYING ALL THE TIME, THIS GAME DOESN'T HAVE THAT, WHICH IS WHY IT'S AUTO 5 STARS FROM ME! MOST OF THE TIME, MC STORYLINE IS DUBBED, EVEN SOME SIDE QUESTS! Please keep this up Star Rail, you are the best! Addition : GENSHIN COULD NEVER!",Positive
"I'm done with the gacha system thought it would be like genshin and I was wrong, it's not, it so much worse that. Having to hit 90 warps to get a gold reward is frustrating and to get the same character multiple times and when I don't get the same character I get his weapon adds insult to injury since I don't like the character. I understand that a gacha game is out to cheat you but this is ridiculous.",Negative
"Honkia star rail is very fun. Gameplay is fun, graphics are cool, the map is vast and beautiful. Gacha and aquiring gacha currency seems to be improved compared to Genshin Impact. Most importantly the story is very good. The devs added lots of humor in the stories and the main character has a lot more personality than Genshin's.",Positive
"I'm already AR 41 and I'm using a mobile phone, suddenly there's an update, after I update my acct started in the beginning, which is my current account that I am using in this game the ar 41 turned into AR 2, pls fix this I'm getting angry because I have been struggling farming and doing quest in this game and then suddenly poof back to the beginning of the story I hope you will fix this kind of issue I'll rate it 1 star for now",Negative
"this game fail to load for a reason, i used to play just fine but in recent updates I can't no longer play this game cause it keeps crashing overall the gameplay are good, the plot? meh, theres alot of grinding, but overall a good game",Negative
"My account got hacked and when I was asked to send Hoyoverse Account Issues Application Form, it's always failed and when I asked hoyoverse cs, they told me I already sent the form even though it's always failed when I tried to sent the application form. I already wait since 20 august and there still no news.",Negative
"Idk how but I got alot of 5 stars! Unlike other games (Ahem... Genshit *Cough*)I love this game, very entertaining and the lore just hits different with how extensive the universe is.",Positive
"The game is great, I'm loving the storyline and the effects and graphics it has, just like genshin. Though Both of the games are unique in their own way which makes both of them special.",Positive
"It's good, it's just that from my own experience, it's too laggy (especially the cutscenes) and has some major bug issues on the parlor/inside the astral express and the inside of Goathe hotel in planet Jaroli-Vi.",Positive
"The design of the characters are great and the graphics is very good, the storyline which is I rated highest keep it up and add more characters in a way that players will promote the game",Positive
Add skip / forward button. That's all,Negative
"Please add a jump button, even though i know that it's completely unnecessary - I don't care. Because having a jump button honestly makes the game feel a bit fun in my opinion.",Positive
been playing since the day of the release and i think its an awesome game!! the graphics is really pretty and each character has their own personality!,Positive
"This is a great game, story, graphics, voice over, characters and all. Looking forward for more story content and more diverse characters",Positive
"Gets boring real quick. Can play it for a few weeks then it gets even more tedious and repetitive than Genshin. Wouldn't spend too much $ in this game, just try it out for a few weeks, after u complete the story you're probably done with the game. Also a horrible discord mod community, makes reddit mods look like decent people.",Negative
"Rating Hsr 1 star because of the bug that I experience After grinding (calyx) bud of memories, I check my inventory I saw that Ihave 0 item from calyx bud of memories But I just spend 800 (""resins""?) Its hurts as a f2p player Fix that and give me back my resins And I'll rate this game a 5 star",Positive
"Honkai and genshin fan here. Amazing game! A lot of people seem to be put off by the turn based startegy, but i think it's a breath of fresh air for the hoyoverse game series. The story and characters otherwise are superb!",Positive
"I was a beta tester for this game and the amount of charm it has is unreal. This looks like it may even top Genshin, which is already my favourite game of all-time! I love the characters, love the turn-based combat, love the world, and so far, love the story. I am so excited for the official launch!",Positive
"It was a very good game but the problem is that it has a limited story, and it sometimes when I attack an enemy a hitbox of an object blocks my attack even though it had a target lock on icon",Positive
Playing this game makes me feel like I was playing combinations of [Phantasy Star Online] and [Final Fantasy XV]. I am quite enjoying the Storyline & the BGM. You can see they put quite a lot of effort into making this game.,Positive
"As the time of posting this, the game is absolutely a MASTERPIECE. I would openly recommend anybody who wants to give it a go. But the best part is that unlike most games, this games' Devs actually listen to player feedbacks. Thank you for that Devs and team and keep up the good work.",Positive
"I mean is not bad but its lag as hell god damn, you really need to work this out its getting out of hand I can't even play with such a long loading screen and I waited for 2 hours!! And I really want to play it it looks so cool",Negative
"i enjoyed playing it at first, saving up for kafka. but after the 1.1 update, i can't get in anymore. i can't log in... my train is half.. its annoying. my wifi is definitely not the problem.. or my phone. pls fix it hoyo :(",Negative
"I lost my account on honkai star rail and can't log back in. Yipee! (I created a new account and had more progress than my old account, i still miss my old account though) still a great game, f2p freindly and actually gives us good rewards with much engame content",Positive
"Love it, very fun game, u love the characters ‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
"I'm genshin player and man this game is alot better than genshin in terms of upgrading system I hope u do same to genshin plz lower the upgrading materials needed for characters in Genshin impact and also plz add something fast the game is empty,dead there is nothing to do. Edit:And also plz fix the lags in cutscenes and some ultimates like Jing yuan it lags so hard.",Positive
"I love it. Simple as that. It's beautiful and really fun game also it's relaxing which is a big plus. Everything is just amazing, worlds , characters, story, gameplay and I must admit that I was really touched by music in this game",Positive
"Game very enjoyable, the rates aren't too bad considering the amount of rewards they give, characters are amazing, and the gameplay is peak",Positive
"Great game smooth even on lower end device good Mechanic's and one of the best turn base game i just wish that they add a skip botton and give the player's more rewards for clearing the calyx,still one of the best game right now",Positive
It's an amazing game I love it I'm lv.60smth and honestly it's a great story game,Positive
"As a fan of turn-based games, this game is well-designed. Rolling on the gacha is highly optional, and you could clear quests without spending a cent.",Positive
Game framerate and performance for mobile hit rock bottom. Seriously it so bad that unable to play the game without freezing and shuttering during battle and top of all that i am playing on super low setting and still lag. Will gave 1 star review until fixed this performance issue other then that the game update is nice and all,Negative
Main redeeming factor of the game is the graphics. Storyline is pretty standard for the type of game and in game mechanics are pretty average too,Negative
"This may be one of the best games of its genre. High quality graphics, it has a lot of detail, good characters design, very good mechanics, the gameplay is fun, I can only find positives for the game. Nothing negative, congratulations to Hoyoverse/Cognosphere for creating such a masterpiece.",Positive
"This game is the best mobile gaming experience, it has the best story, very much likeable characters, a beautiful open world, very fun combat (this is my first turn based game I never thought I would love it so much) and very good endgame content. Thank You Hoyoverse for this wonderful game",Positive
I love this game a lot but it keeps crashing everytime I try to fight an enemy now it doesn't even let me pass the train menu anymore please fix this :( I can't even play anymore,Negative
This turn based game is quite fun! I love how even four stars have an ultimate animation I like the little details they added in the game the story is really interesting I enjoyed this game alot the quests are fun too,Positive
"Yay! We are back to .6% drop rates! Good lord this trend is getting old. And then throw in bloat materials to drop that rate even lower? You guys are on a roll! How about this....on a character pull, you get (I know this is difficult to understand) CHARACTERS! Not 10 different cones that have 0 to do with character drops. Then 300 pulls before getting a 5 star? You serious? Sigh.....",Negative
Suddenly i cant play anymore. When i try to log in the game tries to update and crashes. I already tried cashe clearing and reinstalling. The game keeps crashing and I am using a flag ship phone...,Negative
"Made billions, but so stingy. Can't even give players guaranteed 5* on first ten pull like many other games. Being a turn based, team comp and elements is important so have fun if you're having bad luck on early pulls. I see many indie devs give more rewards and being more generous to their players for early game progression. Hoyo is still the stingy and greedy like always, prepare to have genshin anniv all over again.",Negative
"I'm not a fan of turn based game. I played some in the past and it bores me unlike breath of fire. So H'StarRail gives me the BOF vibe. And i like it. And the designs, graphics, story are great. Another great game Hoyo.",Positive
Love the memes surrounding this game XD and the turn base system is well made with a nostalgic sense to it but you can also auto it for the majority of the gameplay. Overall truly amazing,Positive
"Actually, I'm not really a fan of turn base games, but after trying this game, I got interested and started to like this type of game. The story on Honkai: Star Rail is already good and interesting, lots of husbando and waifu ofc (ÔΩÄ„Éªœâ„Éª¬¥).",Positive
"Guys love the gameplay, characters, locations, battle system, everything but the latest battle is lagging a LOT.. pls check for this Edit: working better after the last update, thanks for listening. Pls bring Blade back xD",Positive
I love this game characters are beautiful the storyline is awesome and the humour is amazing :D The gacha system is pretty good compared to that of genshin (you have limited banners and you have a standard banner that never disappears and once you've pulled on it 300 times you can choose a free 5 star character :] ),Positive
"The good and the bad. Bad like really bad. I played a lot of gacha this is the worts gacha I have experience in my opinion, No UI skip function, no Ii customization. Good opening of the story, kalfka don't leave me.! Boss fight is hype.",Negative
This game has a great graphics and interesting gameplay. But the game got really grindy later on and some of the contents were just to hard to be enjoyed.,Positive
"As expected for a game from a studio of its caliber, it's quality is top-notch. The game delivers even if all you're looking for is simply a turn-based RPG with a good story. Star Rail is more than playable without paying any money, by the way.",Positive
"it's a pretty good game, especially being early-game so far. i don't see any issues related to the game, the ones that people encounter mostly come from their devices due to the amount of storage it takes up.",Positive
"i love it lol i just wanna say that i hope the game has like an event that can play with other players or something like an option for multiplayer since just chatting with your friend ingame is kinda boring, i just wanna play with my friend tho not just using their heroes",Positive
Terrible. I have to unlock the story before I play the events.,Negative
"Lately Hoyo is indulging more and more on the humour and I like it especially. The lore has a lot of potential and MC character is simply amusing. Penacony map is just wonderful, the concept, the music! Hoping to see more :)",Positive
"Crazy good Extremely f2p, even without 5 star you can finish the game Pro: good graphic and story, AUTO button, rich event, f2p friendly, Cons: gacha 5 chance limited banner very low (guaranteed 1 every 90 pulls) System requirement to play this game quite high, you may crash or forced log out if your phone doesn't meet requirement",Positive
"a good quality turn-based RPG for sure. If you like turn-based strategy game you need to try this one, even you if you don't like gacha at all just try it just for once, i've been playing with so much less gacha and still having good experience so far",Positive
"Good game, but this game have issues with login screen. I have no problem with connection, but login screen always need to restart and error. Its annoying issues.",Positive
A good game tbh.. but in my opinion the gameplay is just..it gets boring honestly the story is good.. but the gameplay is kinda like pokemon or like that.. I think I don't like it because I play genshin impact and I like genshins combat style... The game it self is good would recommend for other peopless!!,Positive
"Nice character design and animation i like adventure games, RPG or MMORPG games the only one thing i dont like abt this game is bc you cant play with friends",Positive
"The reason why I rated this game 4 stars is that.... Every time my characters' ultimate starts, the game freezes and sometimes crashes for no reason.",Positive
"It's one of the best games I've played in a few years. I instantly got addicted to playing it. Fun gameplay, good story, amazing characters, and the soundtrack is out of this world!",Positive
"I love this game so much. That it is turn based is a different take than HI3 or genshin, but I honestly love it a lot. The character designs are beautiful! Can't wait what comes in the future!",Positive
The games great overall like the story and character but Everytime I want to play it's always says login error and ask me to reboot many time I thought this was because my internet connection is bad but it wasn't so please fix this,Negative
"I accidentally upgrade equilibrium to 60, im stuck with overpowered boss, cant really proceed to any quest. I try to improve on character upgrade and my character all tanked with garbage defend relic, gate keep with weekly boss limit, wasted/run out of the trailblazee power. Unless I invest some money... Either swipe my card or stop... I choose stop. . Dont like my review? Just make your own...",Negative
"This game combined old fashion game (TBS) and recently popular game (roguelike) together, and make it came out into very interesting and unique gameplay. Moreover, the story and character design are distinguished and beautiful, as expected from mihoyo.",Positive
It's a good game no doubt but when I reach trailblazer 35 no more quest you don't know what to do anymore expect for running and farming those big bosses and everything become so boring why? I think there will be an update because it's a new game I really love this game hope for the update to come soon.,Positive
"The game is great but my phone has some lags like: watching the cutsences in slow motion, the game environment is haywire same for entering the game. Please fix this issue!",Negative
"very fun and engaging game, but might get boring when your level has reached the limit. Over all story is very good and characters as well.",Positive
"It's one of the better games made by Hoyo, in my opinion. It's not super hard to get the currency to get characters, and the game play is enjoyable. It's sort of grindy, but that's expected for a game like this.",Positive
"See also everywhere for 80 free pulls but I only got 20. Is it one of those things where you play for 4 hours and you accumulate the 80 pulls? Idk. And if so, it doesn't seem like it's a reward for downloading like advertised, rather a standard reward for playing that everyone gets. Either way, gg",Negative
My experience playing Honkai Star Rail was so amazing I admired every second of it the characters all look amazing the story is really captivating making you want more. I really love the turn based combat allot it's so generous with their community.,Positive
"pls fix the bugs since 2.0 the game has been glitching walls aren't there ""invisible"" cant play new area because of that game keeps crashing every 5 minutes idk what is happening but i think its a game problem i cant play the game properly going back to genshin i guess üíî",Negative
I would like to say I enjoy playing the game. The enemies are unique so far and the honkai impact 3rd characters returning with new looks is a nice touch. Honkai star rail is a interesting game and I say keep making it better,Positive
"Not for me. Awful rates (0.6% for 5* character), mediocre voice acting and the story didn't grip me at all. I imagine the gameplay might improve once you acquire more powerful and interesting characters, but it lost me day one.",Negative
Highly wonderful! I found the whole game to be fyp friendly!! :) and the story is really good. Only complaint I have is how hard it is to obtain a character sometimes since lightcones are in the gacha but other than that 10/10!,Positive
"Love the gameplay, love the writing, love the designs. It's all so good. The only bad thing is that this game makes me hate my phone for not being able to run it in high settings.",Positive
"The graphics are awesome, but the rewards are terrible and the gatcha rates are absolutely terrible. Literally the only 3 characters that pulled out of multiple ten pulls has be the same character. This made me lose the drive to play and it's only day 2. Stop being so greedy.",Negative
I love it it's just so much space I had to delete everything off my phone to even play. It would bring a lot of players of put on PlayStation 4,Negative
"This game is fun, well it's fun for me. The story, game style, characters and etc. I hope the could make a new gameplay weekly with strategies style.",Positive
"I love it but its super hard to play, it crashes an the frames loss makes it almost impossible to enjoy an play... but it's an awesome game an I've already seen people meme this game which is Hilarious",Negative
"Usually hate mobile game versions but this one is still solid. My only gripe is I cannot connect a controller but the interface is easier than genshin without one so, I still love it.",Positive
"A gacha game that gives you a strong free 5* limited banner character for free! The story is good so far. Currency for summoning has been generous (1 limited banner character or light cone per season if you can manage you resources well for f2p). Content update has been amazing!! Just be warned that the energy charge rate for daily grind a bit slow. Not you typical 5 hours a day game, only play for 1 - 2 hour a day and you're good. Overall, i am enjoyed so much that i'm willing to spend a little",Positive
"Maybe the story seems ok. The majority of fights are simple and pointless. The exploration is alright, but overall there just isn't much content. Mostly the game is just a trap to get people to spend, while there is no reason to spend.",Negative
it's a good game. But It has a glitch in my device like the sky it's turn green at the first city and at the train. Hope you can fix and optimize it more. Thank you,Negative
"Amazing game much much better then genshin (same company's game i must mention) who doesnt take feedbacks apparently. Invest even a little bit of your time and you would be satisfied by the game. Interesting story ,well written characters and beautiful sceneries in the game are just more good factors about it.",Positive
"This game is really fun. Although it's not as optimized as I'd like it, it's really fun and wallet friendly because you don't need ""meta"" units. You can use what you have to progress. I also love the honkaiverse, so very cool",Positive
Lost 7 5050s in a row since the start of the game. I love the game but OMG HOYOVERSE it's not even a 5050 for me anymore just a straight up 100% loss,Negative
"Overall the games are good the graphics, details, npc interactions animations are very well animated also I m very surprised the game runs very smooth in my device afterall I m using high graphics lol You guys hopefully the game will last forever",Positive
"Unplayable, cannot even update the game, dies after 2 seconds on the loading screen. Better play something that doesn't crash everytime",Negative
I can't get past the verification code because the keypad only gives numbers. And when I request the code. I have to tap a sequence that doesn't transfer over to the verification line. Willing to give a better rating if I'm ever able to actually play.,Negative
"There is no game, it's all text. This is not an hyperbole, I am not exaggerating, from every hour you play this game, around 20 minutes are gameplay and 40 minutes are text AND THAT ONLY TAP SPAM TO SKIP THE TEXT. The text can not really be skipped (WHY?!!!!!) so that 20/40 ratio is spent furiously tapping on your screen.",Negative
"Text simulator game, game is too hard, character designs are boring and so is the story.",Negative
"it's a great game, but I'd prefer some melanin in more characters. arlan is the only playable character with darker skin, and it's a little gray. the names on his skills are also... questionable.",Negative
Very fun and Enjoyable. Been playing for over a year now. Story rich & characters are very likeable. Welt is a King.,Positive
"Totally addicted with this game! As a gamer who play turn-based game a lot, HSR is the most suitable for me among Hoyoverse game. The exploration is simple yet twisted your brain sometimes, player who likes puzzle would love this feature. The characters are likeable so you have a motivation to get your husbando or waifu lmao. Overall, HSR game baik. #AkuHSR",Positive
"So I can tell that the game is good and they put a lot of effort in it but I whas reading the other people's reviews and they were so many people who said that there whas a ""error 100_3""Me myself didn't get that error on my phone but I'm kinde scared that it will happen in like the next update or smth ,so it would be nice if hoyoverse can fix that or atleast check on that But overall, it's a good game And I enjoy playing it-^-",Positive
"i love every hoyo game, however. there's a huge disconnect with your global audience. you do not care about properly representing them when they also contribute to your game. i spend money on other hoyo games and i will not continue to do so unless you all actually get it together.",Negative
This game is definitely better then genshin but they kinda gave us what we asked for but only half way.,Negative
The open world is fun but the turn based gameplay like most turn based games gets a little boring and repetative after awhile. But other than that fun game.,Negative
Does nothing but update and restart. Been 'playing' for several minutes and keeps restarting. Latest action was to try to download 9gb (!) of 'resources'. Uninstalled waste of time and space and I've yet to see any of the actual game.,Negative
Very good game good flow of combat the only problem I have with the game is on my phone it tends to lag and then crash when I'm in combat for too long or animations are moving too quickly,Positive
"Great game experience with easy to learn mechanics, but lots of depth to them with the characters. Typical gotcha nonsense but hardly a negative with how generous the rewards are.",Positive
This game is another similar game just like genshin impact. The draws are just so lame it's true that this game have less heroes but the items that I keep on drawing are not really good. If possible can you create a draw spot just for hero draws only. The graphics are okay. And the play is interesting. The game is litterly a game that is without dodge and it sucks if you are making a game that is from honkai and genshin you should put in the ones that are similar on the fighting stale.,Negative
"Played for a couple days then uninstalled. A couple girls with whiny voices running in circles with an occasional battle, but even then a lot of games have more exciting battles.",Negative
"Immersion on the story and designs are just spectacular, the gameplay is enjoyable, def thumbs up for the auto play cause repetition could be quite taxing sometimes !",Positive
"The game is really fun but I have issues with some settings because I want to changed the character and background to high quality the character is fine but the background is like heaven send to all white is blind me please idk is my fault or is a gitch, fix it please my eyes can't take it. üò≠üò≠",Positive
You know it's a good game when the developers heard it's player and having all the QoL changes almost every patches,Positive
Unskippable scenes and text. Not mentioned anywhere on the store page that the end total size is 15+ GB,Negative
"The stunning visuals of this game, animation and everything else is in another world. Really love this game!",Positive
It's incredibly good for a mobile game,Positive
The game is great but it takes up so much space that it's laggy on my phone and I use android and the space is really damaging my phone so I have to delete it and I cant play the new updates :(((( please create a Honkai star rail cloud too hoyoverse it would be great,Positive
"I love this game, very. The weapon banners are much nicer here, and I sometimes get to have the characters I want, without me having to be pay to win, I hope this game becomes even better in the future !!",Positive
"I have this bug where the train is cut in half in the loading screen and Some of the maps are bug, i can see through walls and screen turns yellow whenever i walk Pls fix it soon D: edit: not only that, it also crashes my game now the first time i playee this game everything was fine until the update came :<",Negative
"10/10 game the only complaint i have is no kebin expy so i can have idol trio with welt, otto and kebin.",Positive
Overall a great game there are a few issues like frame drops and crashes and one concern of mine is how much storage will be needed because these games can take o lot of storage after a while,Positive
Love it no other words just perfect chefs kiss,Positive
"Turns out you have to disable adguard DNS if it says login error. So far, the game is amazing, the fighting style was different that i imagined",Positive
"It's a good turn based game. However, if this game wants to challenge E7 then the developers have to consider PvP and guilds. Or else it'll just be turn based Genshin. I have hope for change.",Positive
Its a good game the battles are short but some of them are hard graphics and art style is amazing voice acting is also great and so is the exploration,Positive
5 stars cuz no more Paimon voice. But the advertisement said new players get 80 free pulls :( I got one free pull and some primos from the intro tho. Just not enough for a 10 pull yet. Genshins file is too big to run on my device so I'll be playing this for a while,Positive
"Absolutely love that Hoyoverse is doing a turn-based space fantasy RPG. After years of playing Final Fantasy Brave Exvius and Dislyte, it's a breath of fresh air playing this game! Killer graphics, gorgeous music, this game keeps me engaged!",Positive
This is the best game so far the graphic's are cool and the character's but I don't like when you fight it takes turn and sometimes I have some error..,Positive
"The loading screen takes a lot of time or doesn't load at all, but the game in itself is beautiful and very colorful! Also fun to play.",Positive
"Star rail is so fun and friendly game to play since I just started playing this i experience the kind of gameplay like final fantasy sort of stuff , every part of the game is so exciting and fun.",Positive
I love the game but now it's 32 gb?? How in the worldüò≠üò≠,Positive
"Can't even login the game ,it keep saying too many request please try again later but I already try many times but everytime I try it still not giving me joining that game please fix and I will give a five star because the game is good and It not have laging so please let me join the game",Negative
"Good game, but God you get so much of your storage taken up. Honestly, might be better to play on a computer than a phone half of my storage was used on this game after I had to delete pictures and apps to get it to work",Negative
"The best game I have every played . Amazing combat and characters . If we pull 300 pulls in the standard banner , we will get a free 5 star . Overall the game is like a modern technology game . I recommend it . Amazing gacha too",Positive
"The game is great. I somehow didn't play a day and only have a streak of 215 days online instead of 362 ü•≤ And one thing: I would love it if Hoyo could make something in Hoyolab or an achievement in Star Rail where you could see the playtime on that account. I wanna know my playtime, and not just once a year at the year's end review üò´üòÖ (I know you guys at Hoyo have that data, so please make it public :3 )",Positive
"It's good, but in 1.6 I realized if you want easy and get everything in event, you have to pay. It's a pay to win game, without specific 5 stars character your battle will be more difficult",Positive
"I came here expecting hack and slash, and got turn-based command input combat instead. Instant uninstall. Glad I didn't spend mobile data downloading the 7 gigs of data required.",Negative
"I like the game but for some reason it lags, even though i have enough storage and my specs are fine, whenever im about to finish a battle it freezes and crashes üò≠",Negative
I really like the game and I do enjoy it but the opening screen.. Keep crashing everytime.. Pls fix this issue.. That's all :),Positive
"Hello I just want to say here because I forgot to write down when fill the survey. I play the game about 15-20 minutes but my device already so hot. Unlike Genshin, I play 3 hours and the temperature not as hot as when play this. Please fix it. Thank you!",Positive
I loved this game it's like mobile legends to make easy ways and always got fun everyday,Positive
It is turn based game but...it is too limited when it comes to farm material just like genshin we need to wait 17hour to go farm again...or u can just pay to restore the energy.... why dont just use normal energy?also the fighting system is not the best and very simple....,Negative
Super generous in general can be enjoyed as f2p and low Spencer and high Spender.,Positive
It's takes so long to load L game,Negative
The game itself is good but whenever I log in and it downloads the data the game crashes I tried it 3 different times and the game crashed every single time.,Positive
"Please add gold fragments farmable stage, it's really hard just to salvage relic with bad sub-stats and really wasting gold just to get stats didn't want in the good relics. Please consider this review cause it's really hard for Free to Play just trying to leveling up the new relics.",Negative
Never won 50/50 since day 1 playing__Finally won after more than a year playing üò°,Positive
With the new updates I am getting constant freezing issue when using a character ultimate most of the time it's Clara. I had to close and re open the app.,Negative
Yes when penacony came out every 20 to 30minutes the game crash i recently change my graphics but it always happen when i go to simulates universe or on farming some stuff it literally crash i hope it can fix anytime soon,Positive
Horrible experience with their support. I made a mistake purchase and they don't wanna return my money. Never asked for a refund from them and my account is still new. After I made the mistake I never moved an inch in the game and I don't have a problem if my account got banned. To be honest it's understandable but yet they still giving me a hard time for my money which is a just a 100$!,Negative
"The story, rewards etc. are much better than in Genshin. On phone - sucks cuz everything laggs. Game is badly optimized, same with genshin. Can't play without laggs even on lowest settings. While PGR runs smoothly without any issues on max settings. Also when will you add 120hz for PC and phones? It's 2024 and almost all games have 120hz support...",Negative
"I've always like Hoyo games and while the turn based style might not be for all other Hoyo players I do think this game is much moreobile compatible because of said fighting style. I do think Hoyo games just generally work better on pc. I love how easy getting Steller jades is, though (the currency used to get characters)",Positive
"After a year this game has really matrured. Whilst not open world like Genshin Impact and with fighting still a major element, the story telling has come to the fore. A very enjoyable game to play.",Positive
"Too much dialog , wasting time & boring",Negative
"Can't even get into the game itself, while on the train loading screen it crashes constantly never letting me in, I tried everything to make it work and nothing works :/",Negative
"Very good so far but the cutscenes are unbearably laggy and stutters a lot compared to the gameplay itself that doesn't lag as much compared to the cutscenes, I've been playing different other hoyoverse games and the cutscenes don't lag only this game please fix",Negative
Honestly a great game for every anniversary we should get a free 5 star,Positive
"The game and ganeplay is amazing and reminded me the playstyle I used to play long ago, but sadly I can't play it properly due to the limits of my phone, I'll surely continue playing this game once I get a phone that is compatible than my current phone.",Positive
"Does not support Razer Kishi V2, so giving it 1 star because I won't end up playing it without that functionality. It'd also be nice to see FPS limits higher than 60 or at least an unlocked option.",Negative
Good game with great F2P rewards,Positive
I love the game it's fun the adventures or cool It's kind of lagi though,Positive
The animations are FIRE. the game is very phone friendly... Unlike uhm uhm (genahin impact). The turn based system is super fun. I really like this game,Positive
"I'll be honest here, it's a great game, good graphics, even better characters, and even though turn based action games have never been my favorite I enjoy this one a lot. It has very similar aspects from Genshin, but better quality of life. Would recommend",Positive
"A pretty solid game I enjoy turn base games and they did it well I like the graphics, new characters, and it being space theme bringing whole new concepts to the game.",Positive
"After completing the currently availiable main story and getting to trailblaze level 45 i van say that so far, this game plesantly surprised me. As a guy whos not usually a big fan of turn based combat, here its actually pretty fun! The voice acting is great, the characters are mostly good, the graphics are great. And the music OH the music slaps in this game. This is also one of the most generous gacha games ive ever played, which considering how genshin is surprised me. Overall a great game.",Positive
It's like they just try harder. Star Rail doesn't need to have so many fully voiced scenes or great story or amazing world. They just wanted to do it and we get to enjoy it.,Positive
Honkai Star Rail is the best mobile game it listen in the players and gives out huge rewards! And the characters are really beautiful and handsome u have so many u can do and in the next patch they gonna give u a free five star Dr Ratio! So if ur looking a good mobile game to play i will highly recommend playing hsr its worth it!!,Positive
"Horrifically slow, boring, unfun, consumer unfriendly, slogfest not worth the time it takes to install. The income rate is trash, just like the mind-numbing gameplay that, while incredibly easy, still manages to be ridiculously tedious. I've played idle games more engaging than this snorefest.",Negative
"Music is amazing We have auto battles When we lose a battle and have to go back, we can skip the cut scenes and dialogue Dailies are easy to do 240 daily energy and reserved energy Character designs are cool Sadly, we have no happy birthday voicelines.",Positive
"The Storyline is ok. It is a good RPG. But it is hard to get the character you want, even you pay for your own bill. They might set the lottery jackpot rate too low. LOL.",Negative
Lately the game crashes a LOT when in battle. Like 4-8 times a day this past week. This didn't happen before patch 2.0. My phone has Snapdragon 860 and on lowest settings to avoid heating.,Negative
"Something unto death boss is too hard and complicated, what a dumb move by the game, players cant progress in the main quest. Cognosphere/Hoyoverse, youre way in over your heads.",Negative
"The game was good It was fun to play but ever since the update that added Huohuo, it's been unplayable. At first it was just laggy so I got rid of it but then I tried to redownload it and now it won't even download",Negative
"It's alright but it's similar I guess? Also the rewards aren't very generous, and somehow the gacha luck is not there as well. It's still early to judge but the plot of the story is something to look forward to.",Positive
"It's good & i like RPG games, but unfortunately I stop playing this game. Why you ask? Because every ingame update needs ridiculously big space for my phone (always in thousands Megabytes) That's a big problem for me, but maybe not for other players though.",Positive
Super nice game. F2p friendly with alot of gems provided each patch. Literally as a f2p you can clear all content. Very minimal power creep among characters and in fact the standard char banners released since day 1 is still strong. Interesting battle and combo.,Positive
Great games but can you guys make the equilibrium level can be lowered because i had hard times fighting tough bosses during story mode its kinda frustrating..I just wanna enjoy the story :'(,Positive
"The game is perfect but i do have one suggestion, please make the pre download update more early, maybe like 1 week early before launch or atleast 3 days early. Overall the game is good, and the graphics is amazing.",Positive
"i have seen some people writing the same problem i am facing now. The game crashes whenever i engage in combat, it gets super laggy if i try to either wait or close the game.",Negative
"I hate forcing me to add or level up character that i don't want to level up, no skip option for useless conversations, and the disabled auto battle, all this for me is a turn off üòë",Negative
"it keeps crashing, but overall, still a good and fun game, a lot of events, and rewards. The main story is also very interesting.",Positive
"I relly love this game since release, i hope put level 20 relics set and level 90 characters like on genshin, and not big to much gigabyte updates get full storage the others player's phone,the new event penecony i want to add something hoyoverse i hope see this, can play back the story again like the honkai impact 3rd.",Positive
Get bored after 2 months because it became a load to me. I feel tired playing it everyday. To me it's a game that you can come back and play if you want but eventually you will get bored with it by a few days. The battle system is trash. It is a turn based game but you need to farm those relics and ornaments. I rather play Pokemon game every day than play this game.,Negative
The game would be great if they added a cutscene and dialogue skip button nobody cares about the story or the long conversations they have to sit through just to play the game gameplay is great conversations and stories are garbage going to delete the game because I'm tired of trying to wait 20 minutes for conversations to end just to play,Negative
"Of all the gacha titles and specifically the Hoyo titles. This game is the most fun, but more importantly. Respects my time and wallet. Barely any fomo, events are mostly kept and pity system is more than fair.",Positive
"When I open the there's no train, and after that there's also no floor and walls, it's very hard for me to play, it's very frustrating, I tried uninstalling the game and installing it again but nothing happened",Negative
"I can play it on my phone, dailies aren't a chore that needs a lot of attention. auto play makes it so nice that I just drop and forget. I won't even be behind dailies.",Positive
"what happens after the update 2.0? my phone often experience force close, and freezing. Before the update, the game runs completely normal, this problem makes me uncomfortable.",Negative
Guess this is the end of my trailblazing path fellow trailblazers. The game is now too massive in size for me to continue... I've sacrificed lots of other apps and medias. I have enjoyed my stay. Godspeed.,Positive
OMG!!! I am shocking after playing this game... Unlikely any others mobile game. Very unique graphics and perfect game storyline. Thanks for all of the game Developer and game Company. I hope more to play like this kinda game in the future.....,Positive
"I've been playing since the game released, it's such a fun experience and the style of each character is just amazing, as they make all the characters unique with their play style and weapons (like Dr.Ratio with his book) <3",Positive
"As a day one player I love Honkai star rail since the beginning, the character designs, stories, graphic, world building are all beautifully made. All of the free stuff that had been given are appreciated, which is something that GENSHIN COULD NEVERüó£Ô∏è",Positive
Great action filled turn based game. MANY free pulls (wayyy easier than genshin) and great music and storyline with amazing worlds to visit Penacony has been great and I look forward to more updates,Positive
"For overall this game is very good and the graphic is great, but the cutscenes always lag even using low quality graphic. (I'm play on mobile)",Positive
"This is my new fav game but does the heros be back? I mean if the time spin ends?, like when you go spin and you did not get that hero and the time is almost over does the hero spin won't be back or just the same as genshin? It'll be back like back and back?",Positive
"The gameplay is too simple. The dialog seems to have lost something in translation. 2GB provided only 1 hour of game, now it wants to download 15GB.",Negative
"Hi I just want to make a Complaint about when Delete the game and try to get back on your Account it doesn't really get back to the Account it just Keeps Loading so pls fix this thanks, and this game i really great like the Graphics, Quality all of that stuff so i beg you to fix this so i can play back again‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
"Game is enjoyable. But in new version sometimes i getting Force Close from game. And it's not only happen to me, in facebook group some players also getting force close. In previous version it's never happen though",Positive
It's a brilliant turn strategy game with beautiful visual effects and has events every patch with 10 star rail passes for login.,Positive
"Love the game, hate how there is no extended time limit to get promotion reward for upcoming patches. Please extend the reward days when the event comes out! This is severely annoying for those who don't have time to watch the Stream!",Negative
"Pls fix this bug i just reset my phone and my acc on this game just gone i start all over again to tutorial and more, it's Soo bad to give rating like this, the game is good but I don't why that happen I have 3 account but my main acc is the only one gone i hate to start as newbie again so hard to farm gears damn.",Negative
"Great game with a unique version of a turn based combat system. Love the team behind HSR, keep up the good work!",Positive
"I can't play the game on mobile, the app keeps crashing over and over again since Penacony new version update. Frequent crash on android, please fix this issue.",Negative
"The difficulty is getting harder and harder each patch I can't even beat the starcrusher swarm king with my team with max level relic it's stupid to make a character mission to be this hard,there are other player who only play this game for the story and having a difficult bosses ruined my experience for this game .and as a f2p player this game forces you to get certain characters to beat bosses.this should be illegal",Negative
"It's too hard to beat the game and also you can't win even you take the characters for enemy's weakness. So, I quit the game and never play again.",Negative
"There's alot problem regarding changes in UI, the interface just went blank between them. The funny thing is Genshin is played seamlessly on my phone.",Positive
I had been eagerly waiting for this game to release some months ago and I've been playing it since release! I assure u this game has not disappointed me not even once on top of that the game is very generous to it's player base! A very very very amazing game!,Positive
"Almost a year I've play this game and today my phone giveup. I think it's not fair because you need flagship/gaming phone to played this game, but you make the unique visual. Hate with req device spec, but love game.",Positive
"It's great game with All Perfect Modes!!! But, i stop playing this, because my phone can't playing anymore with low spec. I hope i will get my new high spec phone, then i will get playing this again....",Positive
"It keeps freezing mid battle, especially during an ultimate, I'm forced to exit out the game and when I come back, I have to redo the entire battle üíÄ",Negative
The most recent update is fantastic. The Fate's Atlas feature alone is worth 5 stars to me. It satisfies an organization itch I didn't even know I had. This is by far the best hoyoverse game ive played.,Positive
"Enjoyable and well-made gacha game. Interesting combat and great visuals. The only major downside is that the monetization is aimed strictly at whales. For anyone not willing to spend thousands, the only ""real"" way to purchase Jades is the $5 monthly pack. Everything else is such a terrible, awful deal that you'd basically be throwing your money away. It's $5 once a month for 3000 Jades, or $100 for 8000 Jades. For clarity, it can take up to 14600 Jades to pull ONE 5* character. It's insane.",Positive
"I really would give this an infinite stars. First of all, I forgot how hard life is while I am playing this game, it's a game that brings me happiness. My go-to place. Sadly, I can't no longer play this game because of insufficient storage. But I truly recommend this game. I'm on my way to buy a new phone tho, so see ya!",Positive
"I returned to honkai however its more laggy and unresponsive, it also changes its volume in game with no reason and I'm getting concerned towards my hearing, the story is good but the experience isn't worth it...",Negative
"Best gacha game I've ever played amazing character designs, amazing gameplay that is similar to the Persona series, and last but not least for any fans of Genshin Impact this game improves on all of its characters progression systems and unlike Genshin this game actually has hard content and isn't just a mint picking simulator",Positive
"The game is really fun and I'm having a great time, but the main story bosses ruin the experience. I'm a pretty lucky player who has plenty of great characters and I'm still having so much trouble.",Negative
This game knows what the player wants and is living up to their expectations. There is so much things to do in this game that you will never get bored and lets not forget about the ton of rewards given every patch. Much better than Genshin Impact.,Positive
"Thank you, Honkai stat rail, the stories/missions dropped me into tears, I love it! ‚ô•Ô∏è, Good job on making the story and map, They're beautiful, Keep going, I enjoy this a lot! The stories never disappoint! Thanks, this is a gift for me! üòÅ",Positive
"I really love the game and it has been doing good before but with the penacony update, the game keeps crashing when downloading resources so i can't enter the game. Can you pls fix this :(",Negative
Hoyo please give more fair treatment to your other game. This game is amazing has a lot of endgame content and a whole lot to do no matter at what level you are. And the level requirements are basically non existent,Positive
I really like the gameplay it's not at all clunky and boring,Positive
I had so much fun playing this game <3!!! And the characters/storyline everything is so we'll detailed! Just like Genshin lmao and of course..I don't have enough storage for this T^T I think I really should buy a new one- but anyways I rate this game 5* because they deserve it.,Positive
"The penacony trailers, world and music is what brought me into the game. So far im loving it and just arrived at penacony story chapter. Give me 1 or 2 more cyborg or robot characters please, like clara/svarog. That would be cool!",Positive
"I love the game, characters and story. It constantly crashes on the 24 ultra tho. Not gonna knock off a star since this will likely get fixed",Positive
"This is such a nice game! I love the story, character designs and the humourous dialogue! Rewards are also generously given. This game has a promising future.",Positive
"I want a game with good lore, not an exposition simulator with one puzzle every fifty lines of dialogue. If I was looking to just read, I'd go pick up a book; at least I'm guaranteed to get good writing, unlike in this wannabe epic.",Negative
"art is good, map is good, mechanic is good, story is GOOD. Devs treat you better than your partner with all the rewards, end-game, and quality.",Positive
I really liked this game it's super fun and I love the story and the characters but I deleted the game for about a week and then I downloaded it again and when I logged it all my progress was deleted I don't have any of my characters and everything is gone.,Negative
"This game is fantastic. For me this game is in top 5 in RPG turn-base game. The story is enjoyable too. But C'mon, include PS4 too please. My poor mobile phone can't keep up with the updates.",Positive
"This game isn't bad but after the update i tried downloading the game back and when every loaded i lost my account and i dont know how this happened, please try to contact me and try to fix because i have every rights to write this.",Negative
"The game is good also the how it battles my only concern is there's no way to defeat enemies if you're a f2p player,and add skip option in sidequest its to long to finish 1 quest",Negative
"After new Update 2.0 , it keep crashing after several minutes. Even though I still regularly play these game, it annoys me when i want to grind and catch up with storyline. Phone Xiaomi 12 Lite.",Negative
"This game is very good. It has amazing storyline, and amazing graphics, and amazing characters. And cherry on top is that they give you a lot of rewards so you won't feel left out.",Positive
"I really love this game and I would give it 5 stars but it keeps crashing. I have the same issue with genshin impact, and I have tried everything to fix both but I have had no luck.",Negative
"The garbage this game pulls would be completely unacceptable, panned as ""pay to win, manipulative BS"" were it not for the fact that it's this game or company. I have played this game daily and should not be here still trying to raise characters from week 2 of release to *usable* states because of stingy material drops, and weighted gear stat rolls that are already behind multiple layers of RNG and dead, diluted stat pools. Sure is fun having weeks of work instantly erased by bad RNG.",Negative
"Absolutely amazing game. However, the new update has made it so I can't open the game without it crashing immediately. It's a good game, though, so I won't star it badly.",Positive
How many times does the app need to crash until i can finally download the update? Instand crashing makes it impossible to play the game. Playing on S22 so that should not be the issue,Negative
"I rate it a too, this game is available on my device however it's extremely slow and glitchy. The game looks incredible though! I just can't play it :(",Negative
"Its a great game but theres a lot of bug Like render issue on mobile at lowest environment graphics, also some of the ult animation like Bronya still clunky, but hook ult animation were better cause looks smooth",Positive
"The game is good, but I don't understand the wishing system. I don't know how come I always lose in wishing event. Not just once but I have lots many times than I did in genshin.",Negative
"Great game apart from the constant crashing when starting the game up and updating, apart from that it would be 5 star.",Positive
"A day into playing this and as a former genshin player, I'm very impressed with the systems and managements they put here. Character designs never misses. I really hope hoyoverse doesn't mess it up like genshin this time",Positive
"Amazing game, i'm not really a fan of turn based game but this game hit different. now i love this game. Great game, great developer, great reward, great end game content. Also i'm f2p, and this game is f2p friendly. you can clear all content by being f2p.",Positive
Everything in the game looks good but the only problem is that the game it self take too much from the phone storege with each update take 4 to 11 gb and i can see this become a huge problem in the future if the devs turn a blind eyes to it,Negative
Very fun! Fixes a lot of the problems that Genshin has. Full of strategy if you like strategy games.,Positive
0 stars!!!! y tf my game closes in between!?? its so annoyyingg and irritating pls fix this! also while doing past events pls add all rewards it just feels underwhelming! pls add all! fix ur rate ups! graphics too ! pls fix storage issues too we phone players are barely managing pls add storage manger in game. thnku,Negative
"nope, it's not recommended for people who have low data/wifi, and when I tried to join it's says ""loading"" but it takes like 9 hours",Negative
"Not enough support artifacts to build support characters, the story is pretty mid, the characters are unlikable and somewhat dull in their story, and the characters themselves are too confusing to understand and use, and I can't even link my account so I cant play this game on console.",Negative
"Best rpg so far! Everything is perfect: animation, story, character desing, background music, even character voice..",Positive
I've played since day one and it's been a great experience. The story is good and the characters are likable. Side quests are interesting as well. One of the few games I really enjoy.,Positive
"This game is pretty good overall rlly great but it kinda makes new players like me wait to gacha and yes you're probably like it just takes time! But I don't have that time I have a things to do and when I play a game like Honkai Impact it doesn't make me wait for quests I didn't even know existed to gacha for a character who's banner isn't gonna show up for the next 100+ days. Anyways, good game after all imma give it 5* now cuz I got Jing Yuan in my first 30 pulls~",Positive
"To be fair, As a Genshin Player, I think they definitely WENT ALL OUT while making this game, awesome. Just bothered by the fact most of these features are good but not useful until most of the end game.",Positive
"The game is pretty great, but everytime there's a cutscenes sometimes it's laggy, I played genshin impact and the cutscenes is not laggy at all, please fix it",Positive
It's an amazing game I love this game to the point I lose track of time it's amazing I recommend it... if you have like 18GB of space lol but for real it's amazing and it's more generous instead of genshin impact with five stars,Positive
I had an experience once but My phone really lagged but the game was really fun it gave us free tickets which were nice I really enjoyed the game and I hope in the future I can have more storage to play this...!!,Positive
The game is great but the anniversary rewards aren't that good. We just got 20 pulls last patch and the anniversary is just 10 extra pulls with no endgame content or anything. Rest of it are just minigame contents like genshin,Negative
The only reason why I'm giving 1 star is: I really can't seem to download the new update. It's always stopping or lagging. I cannot even login because it doesn't work for me. I tried to reinstall it but nothing.,Negative
"Fun game, lots to do but very slow progression for the first 8 to 10 hours of gameplay.",Positive
"Honestly, I only came because of Kafka and Blade. But I really stayed for the strategic play style and how more generous they are compared to other games. RIP mobile players, though, with that storage.",Positive
"App keeps crashing on S22 Ultra. Doesn't even take a minute for it to freeze and close itself, no matter how many times I try to reopen it.",Negative
I love the app! Hopes new updates are coming soon! I just love this game but when I play some minutes like 20 mins it brings me back to my home page! Please fix that bug so I can play nicely.,Positive
"Amazing and free to play, you honestly do NOT need to spend money on your favorite charecters, the story is very well written with so many interactions making the world feel alive! I personally recommend atleaat giving this game a try",Positive
"Review has changed from 5 to 3, the stinginess in this game's talent material drop rates is ridiculous and absolutely not time friendly. You'd have to stalk the game constantly and it's driving me away. Please increase the drop rates to a much more reasonable amount.",Positive
Great game and all but I didn't really like the battle style of the enemy turns and player turns. Kinda inconvenient but overall it's great! 5‚òÖ!!,Positive
"I accidentally bought the express on the wrong account. As such, I would like to request a refund. I already bought it on the correct account. If you check my payment history, you'll see two purchases. The first one is the accident and the second one is the correct one.",Negative
"Amazing. A genshin player myself, i found so many similar gameplay elements from that game, and so many more new unique ones. If you enjoy turned based rpgs, like raid shadow legends, this is for you.",Positive
"Please let us lower our equilibrium level, the game became too hard in some quests, to the point where I can't even beat them.",Negative
Why make it mobile when all its gonna do is freeze and the picture will lag? Should've just kept it on console either fix it or take it off the playstore no sense in keeping a game when all its gonna do is crash,Negative
"Fun. Devs are creative and love their game unlike genshin. Devs actually care for their game here and their players. Characters are cool, everything is better than genshin even though it's a TURN BASED GAME. And I don't like turn based games. BUT THIS??? THIS RIGHT HERE? This is THE best slop of turn based games. Did I also say it was better than genshin? Yes. A million times over. The story can be meh at times but at least it's fun.",Positive
"The game itself is very good, but i hate when it is time for cutscene everything becme laggy and stuttering. I guess you guys need to fix this",Negative
After updete to 2.0 the game started to crash frequently when i start the battle. sometimes several times in a row.,Negative
Great game for those who want minimal time completing dailies and binging the stories at weekends. The devs are responsive to their community and they bring new elements to the game through the events.,Positive
"Great storyline and modes, turn based combat on mobile is easy to do and at the moment is quite free to play friendly",Positive
"The game is amazing, the story , graphic design, characters and of course rewards I expect that this treatment we will get till the end of the game",Positive
Ever since the 2.0 update it just KEEPS crashing when I enter battle and my technique points keep getting go to waste. Will not give higher rating until this is fixed!!,Negative
"Great, but time limitations is really making this game a bit frustrating. Trail blazing power is capped at 240. Then you have to wait a full day just to play.",Positive
"Great game, the thing that I absolutely love about HSR is that the devs are so generous and icl if they keep the streak up they will attract more and more player base day by day, I can already see a huge success ahead as they put alot of nice events and mini events for the players",Positive
I think dev should increase the recharge rate of the energy because 1 run takes 2min Max and we can do only 8 runs and done for the day nothing more it gets VERYYYY BORING TO PLAY ONLY 16 MINS AND WAIT A WHOLE DAY FOR FARMING WHICH IS NOTHING BUT DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Negative
The texture of buildings and the floor are not rendering well. But my other big games like Genshin has no problem with sorts of rendering texture,Positive
"Long cut scenes you can't skip. Game play is slow. Also, I didn't get 80 draws or a five star hero when I clicked on the add from ig",Negative
its very buggy towards me having in game texture glitch in and out if only google add a picture feature I can show you and having almost no entire color instead of me floating out of thin air seeing some cool undeveloped stuffs lol,Negative
"It's ok but leveling up means nothing in this game and it's way to complicated with all the different events, you seriously need to get the balance right with the enemies, tales RPGS are way better then this rubbish",Negative
The game was doing fine until the 1.1 update. Now it has even more glitches and would even crash when I log in to the game. Edit: nevermind it's gotten better now after 2.0,Positive
"It wasn't my cup of tea, but it's an objectively good and well-made game. The voice acting is gnarly though. It got to the point that I had to switch the spoken language to japanese - a language I don't speak.",Positive
I updated this game and when I logged in all my data was gone I'm really upset because I got really far in the game please try to fix.apart from that this is a amazing fun game with all kind of quest and cool characters.,Negative
"Good character design, nice exploration and gameplay. Balance overall, cant wait for more updated worlds and planets. I'm waiting for animal planets",Positive
"After the most recent update, the game is crashing constantly. Either on launch before logging in, or when entering a battle.",Negative
"Absolutely amazing. Wonderfully written game has beautiful character designs, fun dialogues and definitely one of the best experiences i have ever had in a gacha game. 10/10 recommend it.",Positive
Why I keep getting a crash when fight lol.... And I have to keep restart the battle... Its annoying... My phone is gaming spec but still crash... Hello?... Anyway please fix this bug tq,Negative
"Pls fix the simulated universe bug, I completed a world and it shows that the rewards are obtained but they are not yet claimed by me. I didn't receive the rewards.",Positive
"Great game, but update 2.0 killed performance on my Galaxy S22 Ultra and it crashes every time I play it. A reinstall did nothing, I expected better from Hoyoverse.",Negative
"This is the greatest turn based game I ever played, it also have a awesome story line like it very much. I love danheng imbibitor lunae so much the design and personality all of it!",Positive
"Amazing game with good graphics and fun gameplay. Only problem is the immense storage required. Otherwise, play this game.",Positive
"Best game in the world. Why I asking like that? Bcs this game can autoplay,free 10 wish when reset banner, and easy explore. Although not as good as genshin but thank you for creating this game",Positive
"Nerf that Ruan Mei's creature boss pls. Been stuck for 2 days fighting that bug, seriously that boss is too hard for new player. You can keep the stat for high lvl player but please nerf it for player below level 50. I know this is strategic game, but that boss is too much.",Negative
"Highly disappointed. On Samsung S22 Ultra didn't get over the first cut scene. Deal with major crush issue if you want more players. At the same time, have no issues with Genshin Impact.",Negative
"The bosses in this game are ridiculously hard to fight, if you're gonna make a boss part of a mission then at least make it a EASIER, it's hard to progress if every boss is too hard to fight. It's also too grindy how am I supposed to fight boss with supper hard difficulty when the drop recourse is so bad!?",Negative
"Absolute waste of my data. After downloading 3 gb,the game won't start or will immediately crash after the first 3 seconds of the intro (the phone is new)",Negative
"This game is too much of an p2w game. What's up with that unbeatable beetle? I had power ups and everything, and that still wasn't enough to beat it, not to mention that annoying summoning it does",Negative
"Great game, GRAPHICS is amazing, Characters are unique and awesome, Generous devs, Story line is very interesting and this us the best RPG/Turn base game I've ever played.",Positive
I play on PC and the animations characters and story is beautiful. I've never played turn game before and I pretty liked how there is easy theory but also you won't win without strategy.,Positive
Why are the boss fights so hard??? I find myself struggling with the echo of war borehole planet's old crater and now I can't even upgrade the character traces. That starcrusher swarm king boss is so unfair.,Negative
"Absolutely amazing!! Good characters, storyline, graphics, audio, everything is awesome.",Positive
"Not loading, since the release of update 2.0 I cannot play this on my phone as during the install for the update the app simply stops and closes down. Had no issues before hand",Negative
"Better than genshin, it's so rewarding and I I find it much more easier to explore in. It also has a very nice sense of humor. We get to see the mc talk from time to time which is refreshing",Positive
It's a good game but the only issue I have is the same problem other people have which is the map bugging out and being see through it's really annoying and wish it would be fixed,Negative
"This game is better than genshin impact when it comes to ingame reward, but the gameplay sucks you need to get all of the characters to progress or to finish events. The events is very hard to beat if you only have a few characters",Negative
"The game is amazing, but if you have an s22 you have no chance of downloading this game, I thought it was hilarious because my partner has an s21 and it downloaded perfectly for them but just doesnt like the s22.",Negative
Amazing it's very addicting and the quality is on point! But if you don't have much storage it can be hard to play because of lags,Positive
"the best game ive played. the character designs are so cool, the story is a top tier, and the gameplay is easy.",Positive
Latest update causes the app to crash during the download on android. I've tried everything to fix it but nothing works yet it works fine on ps5 and pc.,Negative
"It's an amazing game and I've been playing it for around a year now, however recently it's been glitching out badly, especially during cutscenes üòî",Negative
"Love this game so much, everything is nice, from the graphics to the story line, even on the characters. Imma like wow and whoa (perfect example is Dan Heng Imbibitor lunae) yeah so. Thank you hoyo Love it üíúüíú",Positive
"Boring plot, boring combat, 0 strategy, pure power creep annoyingly high pitch voice acting. Good music, but not fitting with the content.",Negative
The story line is op the gameplay is also very good i really love this game the charcter design are so beautiful am literally in love with all the characters they are so cute and beautiful the quest are great endgame are also very good got so many rewards like free charcter and there is also HSR anniversary really love you all üíì,Positive
"Since the newest update of Penacony, it keeps lagging and glitching on my Samsung S23 FE, especially when it comes to battle to cutscene. Fix this, or I won't change my rating.",Negative
"after new patch, game frequently stuck / freeze when starting battle, it happens more often in Penacony, & voice kinda stuttering when fight against new enemy (the Gorilla one)",Negative
"Being honest I love games from Hoyo..Genshin impact, honkai impact 3rdbut this game is the worst game made by hoyo....you cannot defeat certain enemy without having certain character...the events are locked behind quests that are too hard as a f2p...this game only favours those who can spend money",Negative
"Interesting gameplay despite being turn based, a lot better when compared to genshin. The content is actually worthwhile and interesting... This game is good. Definitely worth a try to even non-gacha players",Positive
It is cool and I love the sound affect and characters but I had this bug it was black screen idk how to fix it do I had to delete and download it again,Positive
"One of the best game ever made. The devs for this game are goated with the sauce. Thank yall for actually caring about the player base Edit: Yeah, this does sound hella cringey, sorry about that. But seriously, y'all are doing a very good job as game devs. Hats off to you fine gentlemenüç∑",Positive
"This game has given me motivation in life. I now look forward to going to work every day. In the morning I think to myself: ""I'm earning X pulls today!"". I have much more energy and positive attitude. It has also taught me to pace myself and trained my patience with time-based events/activities. Definitely recommend if you're looking to make a positive change in your life and mindset.",Positive
"Cutscenes sometimes lag. All in all, everything works just imperfectly perfect fine.",Positive
It normally was a game I enjoyed playing but since the update 2.0 the game no longer loads and quits before the game is ready. And I checked the settings of my phone and even tried lowering the quality within the game but nothing works. üò¢,Positive
"Great game, a shame I can't play the 2.1 patch update due to low storage space. Hopefully I get to play again but with a better mobile device.",Positive
Honkai Star Rail is a Wholesome and Uplifting Story that is perfect for everyone! The game's turn based mechanics makes combat a strategic approach and the voice acting is amazing!,Positive
"amazing best game, but MORE STELLAR JADES (jk) but like pls give us quick quest, I wanna skip dialogue of quest but other than that BEST GAME FRFR MUST DOWNLOAD IF U CAN. oh and we endgame players need more trailblaze fuel üò≠üò≠",Positive
It's a really good game. I didn't have much problem running it although my phone's quite old and battered from me dropping it (and I play Genshin and idv). I don't have any complaints but it doesn't draw me in as much as Genshin does.,Positive
love it supported it 1 top up so far the game is enjoyable but the problem is the 18 mins replenish of stamina make it 10 atleast or 5 mins instead of making us wait for 1 month to fully grind the game ill give it five stars if this happens ;),Positive
"See those ads that claim to give you free summons by using the link provided to install? Yea, they lied. You don't get anything. Even then, I summoned with the small amount they give you in the beginning, got a 5 star character that didn't show up in inventory.",Negative
The amount of storage needed just to install this app is absolutely absurd!!!! Can't even play this app cause I REFUSE to delete anything for this. Not going to waste anymore time.,Negative
"Love the game. I love the characters, the story, the gameplay. W anniversary, if only the genshin team could learn...",Positive
The story is amazing. The game play is fun and challenging. Characters are interesting. It's also great on mobile or pc. Hoyoverse knows what they're doing with this one.,Positive
Do not be fooled by people saying this game is generous. You play a game not for endgame but to play your favorite characters You can't build them even if you have battle pass. 2 limited banners every 3 weeks. No substats reroll mechanic. Don't.,Negative
"It's annoying that this game always freezes midway.I still have like 64gb storage left, and yet it acts like this.Sometimes, you have to redo the fight all over again, which is anno8ng",Negative
You know about the quest where u need to take a picture in a certain angle of the cameras the one with the dragon thing yeah sometimes it make me unable to move the screen. Pls fix,Positive
"Its absolutely worth it, I've never played any other honkai games but this one's fresh air and I love the vibe. As of Penacony, nothing can beat such a beautiful story.",Positive
"It's amazing and everything, i love the characters and it's stories but it keeps crashing when i start battling and idk why :(",Positive
Fantastic turn based combat. Story has come a far way from release but it's still short.,Positive
Wow what an game I have no words the graphics are incredible and character nice game so much nice I can't say more but the game is awesome and I want that the game should have a second part like honkai impact 3rd 2nd part is coming so over all nice game keep it up,Positive
"Hi so the problem is, my game keeps crashing everytime I play the game, and my storage is fitting, no high storages a little storage and keeps existing",Negative
I loved this game untill the last update üíî I played it on 3 different phones and in all 3 it crashed alot. It came out from game and my phones stop working for 5 mins. Plz do something,Negative
"This game is such a storage horder for a mid game, if you like this game good for you i just hope you like it so much its the only thing you want on your phone, because it forces you to delete almost every other app on your phone in order to play",Negative
Come on.. it's a wholesome story game and there are a lot of meme/references/easter eggs. Also it includes a completely free-to-play clearable contents.,Positive
"This game consume too much storage, I suggest the developer, needs to fix this issue as soon as possible. And also I will rate this game 5 star.",Negative
"I adore this game! The characters are easy to get attached to, the story is intriguing, and the graphics are awesome!",Positive
"Story was captivating, soundtrack for the various maps were so appropriate Probably one of the best RPGs i havw played in a long time",Positive
"Tbh, this game is so immersive and fun, you don't need to spend money to get good characters, as you get some really good free ones. Overall, I like this a lot.",Positive
"I love it and all, but the only thing I dislike about it is how much storage it takes up. I have to delete photos and apps just so I have enough storage for it.",Positive
"Best game ever, it's my favorite, start playing now for a chance to have a better acc, amazing story, it's easy to get characters unlike genshin and over all a fun casual game",Positive
The character designs and animations. The creator really put effort in this game because this is really entairtaining. I played this day and night!,Positive
I think it is a great game but because I only have about 3 hrs of free time I cant enjoy it that much it is on of those game that u need to invest a lot of time if u want to really enjoy and have fun while play the game,Positive
"Graphics is good but at what cost,it always lag when I'm in the middle of a battle whenever I use Dan heng il ult it always stop but the background music still plays pls fix this on next patch",Positive
"This is really good, i love all the story and stuff, but there is just one thing i just cant play this game anymore is that i cant jump so i cant advance to the next level and i was sad.",Positive
Respond to me please and say Greetings Young Trailblazer ‚ò∫Ô∏è I love hokai the story the depth of the lore the way it makes the player involved and doesn't make me feel like a side character in my own story I would love to make most decisions by myself though but ha I love it either way go team go,Positive
A great game i would say but games like this aren't for me i guess because i tried genshin and this but they become boring and too overwhelming and is polluting my screen so i uninstalled but it is a great game i would vote for it üòâ,Positive
"I didn't usually liking a turn-based game, but this is something else. Playing out of a curiosity, but now I'm addicted. Pro tips: Just find your waifu and nothing's matter anymore",Positive
"These new big update, there a problem. The game freeze while doing all the new quests and that annoying... Hope you guys fix it",Negative
"This game is so awesome. But it's much better if it's also storage-friendly, especially to mobile players, like having past resource management",Positive
After a couple of plays in a couple of days my screen glitched? I already restarted the game a couple of times but it's still the same. Is it just mine? Hope this will be fixed üôÇ,Positive
Amazing turn based game. Graphics gorgeous. Developers listen to the community. Over all I recomand the game for anyone down to try something new,Positive
"This isn't an RPG. It's another copy paste, auto battle turn based garbage excuse of a game. Focused primarily on micro transactions. Stop labeling these trash can apps as RPGs. You insult the genre.",Negative
"Good game experience, lost 50/50, lost interest. Really bad pull mechanic without rewarding you for being a good boy/girl and farming 80 pulls. Cya on the next hoyo game with the same bad mechanics!",Negative
"Literally the best turn based RPG game ever It won the ""best mobile game of the year"" award for a reason and the devs actually respect their players (gave us a free limited 5 star character!! ) And Genshin could never ü§£",Positive
A must try for any turn based fans. The dev team is great with the constant additions of game modes and abundant rewards for the playerbase. Definitely my top gacha by a good margin.,Positive
"I have a problem where everything wont load(Backgrounds,stuff in open world),the train in he loading screen also wont load properly. I tried uninstalling and installing but it's still not loading in,the only exceptions are NPCs,bridges,water and chests",Negative
It's a super fun game. But recently login error is showing continuously. please fix this issue.,Positive
All good it's great and everything but I hate the fact that I had 83 standard 80+ limited in dhil banner then this time with sparkle it's near 80 so I just quit üòÇ maybe this game is not for me if it gives me worst luck,Negative
"This game has to be one of the best ever made, it's a generous game, the story is great and compelling and I recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs and Space Fantasy!",Positive
Doesn't update. Freezes during the update. Used to play on s22 ultra just fine but after the recent updates I tried everything and still can't play on this phone. Uninstalled and tried again still the same,Negative
"The game can be fun at first, but once you get to a certain point it starts to become more challenging and for f2p players it will be hard to progress without spending money.",Negative
"it's a nice game, but I get dizzy from it, unfortunately. also, when the others say it takes up a lot of space, I didn't expect they mean 12gb.",Positive
Was really amaze by the character's design and play style and also their characterization. The npc's are funny specially the npc's in penacony. I love all the details of this game and also I'm really amazed by how generous you are when it comes to rewards‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,Positive
Love the graphic and the music is top ter The rewards are generous and the character design areü§åü§åü§å starting to like it more than genshin,Positive
This app is amazing but there's a problem when I download this on my phone the screen was black and wasn't even downloading so pls fix this! I'm typing this on my phone tho! ‚ù§Ô∏è,Positive
i cant play it at all when i downloaded the loading screen was already a sign that i can not play because the train is glitching and half of it is gone and when it was done loading it was soooooooo laggy and most of the stuff is black then my phone crashed im guessing this is another game to be play with a computer again and i get so annoyed with the ads because i cant play it at all but it keep recommending honkai star rail and genshin impact im already upset i cant play it i have more to say,Negative

"One of the best gacha games that I have ever played. Engaging amazing story, comedic at times. Most importantly fun and deep gameplay.",Positive
"At first I love this game with how it's work. I still love how they present 2.0 patch too. But the most critical thing for me is ""powercreep"". I found the new character overpowering previous character like hi3rd did",Negative
"Its really nice! The graphics and the scenery is lovely, and so is the character design and story.",Positive
I have been playing the game since the beta it was a pretty fun experience but there sure are ways to improve it and I'm pretty certain they'll make it better. Definitely should give it a try if you like turn-based games.,Positive
I Love this game and it's team care about players experience so if you play it well you do not need to spend money to clear some hard content in it. Hope it was helpful,Positive
The game works fine on PC but on Mobile it keeps crashing and it refuses to download all the files The phone I use is Samsung S23 and the game crashes after seconds of opening it,Negative

"It's a very good game but they don't ever tell you that your account gets deleted after 30 days of being inactive which is what happened to me. And I spent probably over 30 hours on the game so yeah, I was pissed off when it got deleted.",Negative
"The chances for characters are too low, you can't even get character on a normal ten times roll, you've gotta do several just to get the more common characters",Negative
"i really loved the recent aetherium wars event. this was honestly such a blast ive not had as much fun in hsr since the launch loved the music, the pacing as well as new content being introduced after each content please add moree to aetherium wars and bring such fun events it was such a blast and i want more.",Positive
I love honkai Star Rail so much the story the characters the graphics but there is One problem and that's the boss in the stories there super difficult even if my characters are strong it's very difficult so please myhoyo can you make the boss a little easy ü•∫,Negative
This game takes up alot of space. I love it and all but it could take up less space :/ literally the only thing stopping me from playing.,Negative

"Sorry for the two stars but, it needs too much of my gb, in total it needs 19GB. My phone can't handle that, also. It is a fun game but I really need the GB price lower.",Negative

"It's a fun adventurous game And if you like genshin, you would like this one.",Positive
"Literally the best mobile game I have ever played, I enjoy it every day and it only becomes better with each update. I send all the love and support to the developers!",Positive
I was not at home today so i decided to play on mobile... The game started crashing repeatedly when i tried to play simulated universe... Please fix this issue,Negative
The game devs for both honkai games actually listen to player/feedback inside surveys. Unlike a certain other game... Im enjoying this far more than the berry collecting simulator.,Positive
"Hate The game Hate the Ads Takes up too much storage. I hate the Cringey ""Hi aStReL ExPrEsSeS"" and the worst of all you can't skip the Ad. I don't even consider you a game and fighting and getting new characters Are WORTHLESS. You're like fortnite but Worse and Fortnite is already Bad. I would see myself out the game Goodbye, You're game Sucks.",Negative
"Love the overall experience. Especially when devs show us they care for us and they never miss. Every patch so far they have delivered, honestly genshin could never.",Positive
"Absolute rubbish, can't skip past the talking parts, would be a good game if it wasn't for that I've played 20 minutes of this game and so far only 1 minute was of game time the rest was reading, cause you can't skip the boring bits",Negative
Enjoyable game. Lots to do in terms of events and storyline. Unfortunately the game is prone to crashing.,Negative
"Only flaw is the update packages, I wish it wasn't so large at every update! I love the game overall, but it's getting out of control.",Positive
Very great grpahics. I've been playing for 100 days and I still enjoy every part of the game. Grinding is so fun because of the auto system.,Positive
For anyone struggling with 2.0 crashing change your display settings on the login screen from compatible to normal.,Positive
"I've played since the game released and it's so much easier to enjoy and the graphics are amazing, it's a great and enjoyable game for anyone that wants to play open world with turn based fighting but doesn't want to spend to much time on videos games",Positive
"The RNG in this game is awful, and everything that you do in this game is decided by RNG. The character, equipment, weapon, even the stats for the equipment is decided by RNG. I rather do gambling at this point than play this.",Negative
Love the game! Very generous gacha with a great cast of characters; amazing story and has some breathtaking moments for the player!,Positive
Please fix the lag and glitches issue overall the game is great i just can't appreciate the animation if the performance is not what you expected Please add PVP that has a ranking system where you get a special currency to buy items or lightcone or imposters like the ones in herta shop ü•≤ It's quite good to have a PvP in this game to challenge players more by fighting each other and since this doesn't have a multiplayer system you can just make it to PvP Don't revamp seele's ult,Negative
honestly was a fun game at first. started getting bored after a while but got back into it. storage is suffering though.,Negative
Lost Acheron 50/50 to Himeko and I no longer have the desire to play. I was already loosing my spark for the game from loosing Ruan Mei 50/50 to Bronya. I played this game for free pulls. From 0 to 80 pulls and I lost the 50/50. Good bye. I'm not coming back.,Negative
"amazing game, beautiful graphics, really funny dialogue options & beautiful characters designs. very generous game i 100% recommend 10/10 game!",Positive
Can't even play. Tries to download updates that never complete and crashes. Seems I'm not alone. Waste of time.,Negative
Like fr i love this game but like it keeps crashing?? Like im using s23 FE so like im supposing that it should be able to support hsr so i have no idea why the app keeps crashing on me. Like i js wanna pull for DH IL pls üò≠,Negative
Ok it is a good game..... It is just there is so much speaking you can't really enjoy it. It also takes up quite a bit of storage. Piece out,Negative
"Great game, great storyline. Amazing graphics and a lovable cast to boot. Definitely check this game out if you have room on your device.",Positive
Why is the size of this game so big? For a game with limited space and no open world it‚Äôs size is sure too big. Why there isn‚Äôt any option to delete files of old and fininshed contents? Not only this game is boring but also a bloated mess.,Negative
"The management team is like family in this game: appreciative and kind. You all are such wonderful people, please keep making more games like this one",Positive
I love this game so much the graphics and the game story is great and yeah thank you hoyoverse for these great and awesome games. üòåüéÆ HONKAI FOREVER!!!,Positive
I really loved the game and played it the most but after finishing the story there is nothing to do I would like THE DEVELOPERS to take care of their game and upload continuous updates but for now Iam deleting it.,Negative
i get frame drop sometimes but thats fine tho but i hope you do smth abt it. lore and gameplay are cool also character designs and skills overall great game,Positive
"I like the game, but I can't progress in the story at all even when I'm more levels than the enemy.",Negative
"It was such a good game, I love it but unfortunately I had to delete it because it took up my storage. But it doesn't take up so much space like genshin impact!",Positive
"The game is really good, but it just turns off after a few minutes even when the connection is okay and when i have a lot of free space on my phone. Let's hope the developers will fix this issue",Positive
"Absolutely awesome. Top tier game that doesn't disappoint. The world, story, characters, graphics, gameplay are all easily the best mobile has to offer.",Positive
This game is so cool and I like the graphics this game is my fav game now it's not lag too this game I rate 5 stars,Positive
"I love it, but it's downloading the resources so slow. It even sometimes says that it failed when my wi fi is on 5 bars.",Positive
"Very fun, e6 Xueyi LMAO instead of Firefly",Positive
"Sadly, even though I pre-registered, I can't play the game because it says login error and it crashes the game then back to the loading screen. I hope you can fix this :(",Negative
"I love the game a lot üíñüíñ great graphics and stories, I'm hoping that the next penacony story quest releases !",Positive
"It has unique and interesting story and I really enjoy both story and content in this game, even if you had reached end game content",Positive
"Can you make Topaz and other female that are like her a bit more voluptuous, if you can't add other features to interact with the character at least make them pleasing to look at if men have muscles why can't women be voluptuous",Negative
i like the drink making event. pretty shapes and colors,Positive
"It's a great game, but I don't like the level requirements for playing story. It really puts things on halt because levelling can be slow.",Positive
"This game is making me delude- just kidding. Characters, sceneries, and the plots are just- chef's kiss. The devs are responsive, I love itüñ§üñ§",Positive
"One of best games. Half is Genshin with improvements which we only dream of. Amazing characters, easy to play, auto play (which isn't in Genshin ), long distance run (not in Genshin again üò≠) , handsome tall boys and with long hair. Amazing.",Positive
"Edit: It's running less hot after update. As for gacha, feels like at home like Genshin in terms of misery. Dismal rate with multiple copies to make it useful. However, grinding for resource is less painful compared to Genshin due to auto battle function and less hurdle to farm it regardless of levels.",Positive
Very good Spend all my money and it's Worth it,Positive
"The game is really good. A nice refreshment for me if I am bored of Genshin. Tho, eversince I started the Luofu Story, my screen goes black everytime I finished a battle. Please fix this, thanks in advance.",Positive
I love the game and everything but I've been stuck beside an npc for like 3 days and I tried to glitch to get out but couldn't what should I do? I really wanna play and do missions and I've been unable to do them because I'm stuck beside the npc.,Positive
"One of my favourite genre, turn based game. They took the best QoL of their previous game and enhance it. The gacha rate aren't that bad either. The ratio of male and female playable character are promising, I hope they keep up with the ratio.",Positive
"A real 5 stars. No ads at all, tons of story, fun dialogue. Great challenge. Colofur characters and nice visual. This game is battery hungry!! Still 5 stars.",Positive
"It's good, but questionable good sometimes. So I'm a honkai impact 3rd player, and a lot of characters have been thrown in this HI3 Genshin Lord of Heroes mashup, (HI3 stands for honkai impact 3rd FYI) and some suspicious animations such as how himeko uses a pizza cutter! And because obviously this game is mostly genshin based, the rates are a bit... Oof. If someone's reading this other than the devs, GET THIS GAME NOW! You won't regret it. Also, please make the rates better, please. ;)",Positive
Great improvement over genshin. I find that star rail is much more willing to listen to the community as well as being generous with rewards removing a lot of the garcha pressure to pay. Esthetically amazing obviously.,Positive
"Really excited for this one of a kind space open world exploration story based turn based gacha game with amazing husbands and nice waifus. But no really, I really hope to connect and love the world and lore hoyoverse creats just like they did with Genshin. Story and characters will make or break this game, so this starward traveller is certainly ready for departure. 5 out of 5 from what I have seen and I will not be disappointed.",Positive
"Very interesting game, if you like Turn Based RPG game you gonna try it. Really smooth gameplay, it does have some similiarity with Genshin, have elements system but with more advanced features. Good game worth a try!",Positive
Very good game but every time I update the game it always restarts my account and I can't get it back anymore but overall good game :) please fix that,Positive
The game is honestly really good from what I've experienced so far! I really like the story and that we're traveling through space <3 I don't have any issues with the game!,Positive
5 stars for free limited 5 star character Dr. Ratio. The game is also very nice and easy to play with amazing story and music ( Hoyoverse games have great music in general ). Have been playing this since launch and absolutely love it.,Positive
"Amazing Visuals, and characters. Game play is fun and engaging. Characters are beautiful and well designed. The voice acting is very well done, both Japanese and English. Overall the game was worth the wait.",Positive
"its a really great game, although some action events may be too difficult and very time-consuming. Each and every character are so unique and since im f2p i dont have enough jades to wish for all of them üò≠ esp after losing my 50/50 to jingliu and ruan mei. Hsr are also generous with their rewards which i love so much.",Positive
"The new updates have made the game much more playable which I'm thankful for. But my device keeps lagging whenever I move around after I change like, one graohic setting. Pls fix",Positive
"The character designs are good but some are just repeated style but it's alright, massive suprise awards for f2p lol the playstyles are also cool, I love the NPC designs so love me too LET ME HAVE ACHERON MID PITY PLS (I'm guaranteed ;-;)",Positive
"Love this game, everything is better than genshin (turn based might not be for you though). 1 issue right now - inconsistent pronunciation , jumping between she and they And if powercreap reach to a point where i can't play March 7th even with 5* weapon i will drop the game. Also Can't wait for ZZZ .",Positive
"Can't login with Facebook. Work fine on iOS. Facebook not allow browsers embedded login, but the honkai app itself didn't call out the Facebook app in phone to login.",Negative
"Exactly the same as genshin impact but with turnbased combat. Unskippable cutscenes and dialog remain, the horrible constellation system is here. There are no improvements from any of the GI systems and even the menu sounds are the same. Idk why I expected any better, mihoyo is trash.",Negative
"Story is actually pretty neat. Obviously gatcha system is gonna gatcha, but from my experience, the game gives a lot resources to F2P folk from just playing. I'm just an average gatcha enjoyer hoping for them lucky pulls. The events have been a cool development also. Keep at it üëç.",Positive
"Gacha is way better than genshin, its fun n easy. Thumbs up!!",Positive
"It's ok , just like genshin it takes up a lot of room. And it's kinda glitchy. Not a big fan of the turn baced combat ether.",Negative
Good story fun game reminds me little of final fantasy,Positive
"Graphics are literally too good. My phone crashed from overheating shortly after tutorial, so guess I have to wait for console version.",Positive
"Powercreep, and annoying character favouritism. Community is also bad but thats to be expected from Honkai/ Hoyo community. Shame since game used to be good but storyline started becoming so cringe and mid with wasted opportunities and characters.",Negative
Hi.. quite dissapointed actually.. tried to play on samsung A04 but the lagging from the beginning until meet silver wolf is super annoying tbh.. super lag and had to restart also tweak settings to make it less lagging but in the end its still lag.. please fix it tq,Negative
"ofcourse i love it, Stories, Characters, their design, it's open world game, and characters having background lore makes it more epik.",Positive
"I can't download my resources for 2 minutes without it crashing. I'm confused because this never happened when I downloaded Genshin or Honkai, every time I open the app for 2-5 minutes it will kick me out. I managed to download all the resources after countless times of being kicked out, when I try to start the game it says ‚ÄúLogin error 1001_3‚Äù. I pre-registered my account and it was the same account I used for Genshin and Honkai Impact. This is the first time I'm having problems with a game.",Negative
"The full review: Honkai Star Rail is a 3d turn based game where you build teams of 4 characters based on 7 elements and 7 types. The main idea is to listen to a story, explore the world for chests, fight bosses using only 3 skills, and repeat. Then whale money for lightcones to buff stats and characters gacha. As this is said, there are flaws. Characters only have 3 skills making combat repetitive and non-rewarding, bugs, high gacha need 90 for 100% characters drop. No content and no end game.",Negative
Lovely game. Aesthetic character designs and amazing story telling. Good game design with amazing fighting effects.,Positive
"Love it. But, it is getting difficult to progress due to lack of material drops & lack of adequate trailblaze power & the fuell.",Positive
The game is fun and the story is also good but they are so many errors when I just login just now can you please fix this problem the game is super good and the art is beautiful so please fix this problem I wanna play honkai starrail so bad :<,Negative
Good game with lots of mini events for keeping you going but normal pulls really has low rates of 5 star drops and playing on phone consumes a lot of battery even when you are playing on lowest graphs.,Positive
So far I'm enjoying the experience. Each characters I've played with feels good to use and the story grabbed my attention better than the previous games this company came out with. I can see myself playing this for quite some time.,Positive
"I was very excited when you release this game, but to my surprise and disappointment, the game won't start. It just a train sailing through space and that's it. But I am still give you a decent stars as a review for the sole purpose I am going to wait for you to fix this because I want to play this game badly. Hope you do something about this as soon as possible.",Negative
new update wont work,Negative
I've played a couple honkai games but this is by far the best one I've played. Ive spent absolutely nothing so far and don't feel limited or feel as if it's impossible to progress like I do with other gachas.,Positive
"Descent game but the game won't let me log in for the past 5 days and when I was able to log in the game would lag, audio will cut out and the graphics will change automatically even going bright white",Negative
"I absolutely love Star Rail. I've been playing it since its official launch, and allni can say is that I want more. From the characters to the combat, it has me hooked. I wish all the trailblazers luck on their pulls and pity shall be kind to them!",Positive
"This game is overall good. I thinkt hey just need to fix their log in system cause currently I CAN NOT LOG IN RIGHT NOW. An error ""Network time out 206"" keeps popping out EVERYTIME i try to log in. Ive tried reinstalling and restarting my gadget bur ntohing happened. Hopefully, the team fixes this big cause my friend had encountered this problem also and quitted after cause there was no solution to fix it.",Negative
"dont be stubborn, ignorant and just fix natlan character's skin tone PLEASE.",Negative
"I sometimes encounter a problem with the loading screen it still keeps loading and I can't enter the game, however that's all the problem I'm experiencing overall it's a good game and fun to play",Positive
Phenomenal so far. More F2P friendly than other gacha games. Story has been very well scripted and the voice actors in game are very passionate in their work.,Positive
"Why happen with this game? I play it in afternoon earlier then I open it evening 9:11 pm then just hoyoverse sign in just pop up, I pick my account am using and when the game is login open it my progress went back to the very beginning, like wth is happening here??",Negative
"Even though it's turn based, it's a great game with an outer space theme, that's not star wars or some planet mining garbage. 5 stars all day everyday! Good story telling as well, both main and side stories.",Positive
good game with many interesting simulated universe to test out strategy,Positive
"Its really cool game for sure has nice gameplay and such. The story is also really great, the bonds of old characters still can be seen there and im really glad that i was able to see the character i love again. Hoyo can u give me clara or seele? I putted a good review now",Positive
Poorly optimised making it heat up high end phones even at low settings after a few mins. Not having an option to disable ult animations and skip cutscenes at first look is disappointing and annoying,Negative
"I really like the graphics of the game, and i thought that i would get bored by the turn base game mechanics, but i was surprised that i didn't. So if you don't like turn base games, you should just play other games like genshin",Positive
I have played this in now.gg I like it so much but when I downloaded it then it crash so many times in loading and when I completed loading then it shows only black screen and then it crash and there is a time limit in now.gg so I can't play it.I am so sad I really want to play it so please fix it.,Negative
Really good always winning 50 50 feels good.,Positive
This game is has the smoothest scenes. It's like no other games I have played.it has adventurous things. But I hope Honkai will get updated with new characters. I'm always full of enthusiasm whenever it's updated with new characters.,Positive
The game overall have the best experience..but right now I have an issue with my background before i enter the game...it's became green on the background..I just wanna ask it is because some kind of glitch or bug before update came in ? ( the glitch already fixed ),Positive

HOYOVERSE you guys are awesome!! Looking forward on a lot of characters & buffs.. Definitely Love this game!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
"Even though the gacha hasn't been generous with me, I've been having a good time with the game. My favourite part is the community. With this game, I got to interact with people who have similar interests to mine. The story updates are getting stale but I do appreciate the character designs.",Positive
"It's good game, I loved the starting character ""March 7"" she's top tier hoping to get her dups!! But I'm not able to play on Android mobile, shows me a login error 1001-3, so I'm playing on pc.. Dev's help plz..",Positive
"I used to enjoy this game but now it is not. The game now is more rigged and unfairly based on the calculations. The rate draw is totally broke and some barely didn't get 5 stars character no matter how many draws they made. Pity. I spent money to enjoy, not to suffer. Sorry, one star. My heart just too broken to enjoy the game. No compesation is able to fix it.",Negative
Fun turn based RPG. Great graphics and art style. Its held my attention. I do wish there weren't as many currencies in the game.,Positive
"I really liked this game, especially the characters in the game are great and especially the game system is not stingy for giving items.",Positive
"Terrible gacha system, legitimately spent months building pity only for my 75 pity to be ended by one 10 pull. The game is fine but oh my god the fact i spent so much time on this game just for me to get a character that's not even a limited is insane",Negative
"This games amazing for a moblie game, the graphics and gameplay are good, the musics amazing (even the story line is decent enough) it f2p friendly all and all it feels like the developers put a lot of care and love into making this game L",Positive
"Honkai: Star Rail is just awesome. I love it. It's so refreshing to play a game with new mechanics, intriguing storyline and unique characters. I'm sooo tired of playing Genshin Touring Light Impact everyday.",Positive
Enjoyable casual game with action elements and quite a peculiar/interesting story. Tons of meme references which is the cherry on top.,Positive
Good game and great story. And can you add a reply to a scene so that we can re-watch it if we want.,Positive
"Game play is incredible, and its got crazy graphics, and is very immersev. No bugs that I have seen, just a great game, highly recommended to try.",Positive
"Great story and character design, cool animations, generous developers, don't need hours of grinding and risk burnout, always have events for endgame players, funny interactions and achievements. 10/10",Positive
"Top quality, smooth gameplay, excellent music, captivating lore and f2p friendly. Only gripe is the lack of content but that will be rolled out soon like Genshin, so 5 stars. I don't worry about the gacha rates, i use my 4 stars and mc mostly.",Positive
I play this so much. Absolutely in love best game by Hoyo yet,Positive
"Cannot log in, it says error occurred always when I log in. I also have enough data for my phone (256gb) and enough ram(8g) and have enough data through WiFi.",Negative
"Friend's account got banned for ""security risk"", without any explanation or clause for dispute. They have not broken any ToS, but CS won't listen. Might be a good game, but how can they tell now that their hardwork has been unreasonably taken away? Please note that CS was contacted and they were coldly told ""not to contact CS anymore as the decision is final"", once again, without valid reason. Developers then replied to my review and asked me to contact CS...that is just pure insanity.",Negative
"I've been playing the game for a while and so far its the best since every story is really good for me and the fighting style is cool too, I am really having so much fun in the game.",Positive
I am clearly impressed by the way how hoyoverse put so much effort into this game while keeping the expectations of players into reality. i would really give really give 5 stars to the game if they would at least give better rewards to the game as they did hit top charts,Positive
This game takes historical inspiration from people of color without caring to accurately depict them. Time and time again. I don't regret quitting this when I did.,Negative
Definitely what I've been looking for in Hoyo Universe. Semi auto. Not fully turn-based and not fully rpg. Great storyline. Great graphic. Definitely not a p2w game unless you're rushing to level up. üòÅüòÅüòÅ,Positive
"Better than most AAA games. The 2.0 update is amazing. Hats off to 2.0's music, environment, and story.",Positive
The game is amazing I've seen the beta gameplays and this game exceeded my expectations now that it's released although I have one problem which is the optimization of the game it seems even in my 855 snapdragon processor with 8GB ram still lags a lot I would give it 5 stars when this game gets an optimization update,Positive
I truly love the game. But the screen goes black when I win a fight. The recent event where we help Leonard. & Then enter domain to scan garfitti & get into fight. The game goes black there. Please fix it ASAP. I need to play.,Positive
Playing since 1.2 the game has developed soo much it's soo enjoyable!,Positive
This game is the best RPG i've ever played. It has rich storyline and amazing worldbuilding. Been hooked since its release. Keep it up devs!,Positive
"This game is really fun and all but everytime I wanna play this game, it always say ""log in error occured"" even though my wifi is completely fine. I'm jealous of seeing people who can play this game normally while I try so many times to log in but still fail",Positive
Unfortunately it falls prey to the genre it released itself in. Balance between strategic turn based game play and monetization functionally heavily leaned on the latter. It's competition like the infamous FGO for example infuriatingly actually did a better job (even though star rail does have better rates),Negative
"absolutely beautiful graphics, story, voice acting and such! I'm still newish to the game! I can't wait to get back home and continue it!",Positive
"Started this at launch. Didn't really bother with it the past few months. Never Uninstalled. Went to play it to link my PS5 to my progress, and poof! All my progress is gone. So mad",Negative
"This game is very fun and relaxing, I don't really care about the storyline lol but the highly detailed and good character design is very satisfying",Positive
Probably my favorite as far as graphics go. I'm very happy about the regular events that occur to keep it from being repetitive. Definitely a fan of this game.,Positive
"I really enjoy the game since the start, the characters are awesome, story line entertaining, gameplay easy and understandable, and overall really fun and exciting game<3.",Positive
Gameplay is awesome I love the turn based combat The annoying thing is the story line and there's no skip button it's all blah blah blah blah! Why showcase a very poor writing? Characters and story are inspired by other animes and video games it's not original! edit: can't login on a different device,Negative
"10/10 story. 8/10 Events (just bc I'm too bz to play for the events, but they do have a feature where u can play them even after the event ended). 10/10 characters. 10/10 gameplay. 10/10 graphics. 10/10 UI. Overall 9/10",Positive
Great game but after going through the intro the game requires to download more than 16Gb of data which unfortunately I can't spare on a mobile device.,Negative
"Stunning visuals, amazing voice acting and the devs are super generous with the jades. The game also keeps getting better and better somehow with every update.",Positive
Game is super good and amazing. But for some reason after an update to the game it now runs like poop on my phone. It's playable but extremely laggy. I have the space and specs,Negative
You guys should add a feature if the player is using only 1 account then resources of the old quests will be automatically deleted to save up storage nad after logging in the gmae should detect our unfinished quests before downloading all the resources,Positive
"the Indonesian subtitle are distracting, more like reading a meme",Positive
"What is so fancy about that we need to download a resource of 15 GB? download failed in the middle. background download doesn't help, it still fails. and now this game can't be played anymore on my phone. thank you because you have stolen our money, data and timeüëèüëèüëè. RIP üòè",Negative
"Ever since the game removed the old simulated universe, I cannot farm the relics I need anymore. Hope HSR will bring back the old Simulated universe cuz its too much work man :(",Negative
Amazing game i have so much fun playing it cant wait for future updates,Positive
"Absolutely love this game, The trailblazers are funny as hell and the game is unhinged while still following the storyline. I love EVERY character I didn't know if I would like the turn based RPG style but I actually really love it",Positive
"The game started off good but the company itself is a bit too problematic in my eyes, same goes for genshin...plus it gat way to pay to win",Negative
Insanely hard to level heroes and the skill level on bosses is far beyond your hero level. The gacha system is horrible and hard to come by. All in all better games out there.,Negative
"Honkai Trails of Star Ocean Galaxy Express Genshin Impact. Take your JRPG and smash it into Genshin progression and monetization and skim away the large amount of action each JRPG character can make. Then end mush is what you get, take it or leave it. At least it has auto battle, but still no dialog skip.",Negative
"I truly hope that you guys can make games that can hold their own after 1 purchase. You guys have talent, but you don't have the respect. You have the renown, but your medium is looked down upon. Right before you reach a plateau. Understand that alot of people avoid gatcha mechanics like the plauge. And intrest will fall either way you go. I want you to take this into consideration, because the future is tomorrow and the definition of insanity.",Positive
"Login error. My problem is whenever I press start it keeps showing ""Login error"" idk what the problem is... I registered using my Gmail btw... I hope you can answer my concern... I really wanna try to play this game. Thank you!‚ù§Ô∏è",Negative
"Everything is good character, design, gameplay, music, good updates, good rewards, and much more for F2P But my luck in this is hugging the trashcan",Positive
"I am a huge fan of Genshin Impact. I was so surprised when I met all the other games Hoyoverse is going to be release so I was so exited about honkai Star Rail. I don't play Honkai Impact because there are only female characters and I hope Star Rail gives Me some good times playing it also handsome male characters. Moreover, the concept I find is pretty similar to Genshin which makes Me wanna play it even more. Additionally, is is also a different play style which awesome animations.",Positive
This game is really good played it on release and I got my first 5 star seele but after it updated it kinda got laggy to the point where I crash because I'm in mobile I wish to comeback soon so pls honkai star rail fix this.,Positive
"The game itself is actually good , the only problem are the cutscenes it lags a lot ,my phone is realme c55 i hoped this get a fix maybe someday",Positive
"My in game's cutscenes are still lagging since 1.0, please fix it, it's annoying",Positive
"Very much enjoying the game, Amazing turn base combat, I am not a fan of turn based games in general but this game does make it feel enjoyable. I still don't know if the game opens up more so far quite linier gameplay but still fun.",Positive
It's a very fun game I like boothill and how he says different words,Positive
"What did yall do to the graphics for low end devices to have non existent walls and floors, the loading screen in the worst part of this new update, you cant even play the game, it was better when it was released",Negative
Recently android/mobile users are having trouble re-joining the game or more like downloading the game data and getting through. Please fix this issue ASAP!,Negative
"Really, really good story. Balanced gacha and upgrade system, and there's frequent events and things to keep up with even when you're up to date. I love this game and can't wait to see more.",Positive
This game is very good and skills and improve but the thing is sometimes the loading takes time in my phone so i download it on my new ipad one but still good game!,Positive
"I really like this game especially when i'm in mood of emjoying the story and fun part, but it was also negative impact in my phone whenever i update as i open the app...only to be greet with redownloading the Resources which it take my fats connection alot again...this is 4th time now happening to me",Negative
"I got it to work and while it does work, the story is bland and the open world is locked by beating the entire story. Edit: it's **way** too laggy",Negative
I'm not gonna lie this game really great the mechanic and the graphics work very well unfortunately for me my phone can't handle the downloading the large file needed for the game,Positive
"The recent update made the whole game lag so hard, my phone is capable of playing the game in high settings and maintaining 60fps atleast but now it just lag, even in medium settings the game still lags and I know my phone isn't the reason. Please fix or give another patch",Negative
I'm having audio issues. For some reason the audio doesn't work when it does it uses the phone speaker and not the actual speaker. Edit: Now it's fixed but it uses the phone speaker and not the media speaker,Negative
Love this game so much characters designs are so good too,Positive
"Was scared of trying turn based but it turned out pretty fun, definately would reccomend. Though one complain The latest 1.2 area in the update is not as optimised as the other regions.",Positive
The game is beautiful and it greatly respects your time. You can do your dailies sometimes as fast as 5 minutes. There's no real paywall as you can do most of the game content without being max. It just takes patience.,Positive
"Too much talking, no skip button, 70% of the gameplay is to listening to boring conversation, the rest 30% is standard turn based rpg with long as* ult animation, abyssmal gacha rate just like genshin, scarce resource. There you have it, my honest review.",Negative
"Amazing story, character design and turn based experience. Enjoying it a whole lot more than its predecessor.",Positive
This game would be better because of the lag but I changed to PC and its so good this game needs to fix the graphics but it's fine it's so good üòä,Positive
It will be great if the pre installed can be lower than 7gb. I'm very dissapointed playing the games every time there is a new updates especially the pre installed.,Positive
"I have been addicted to this game for months!There is so much you can do like building characters,playing the story*which is very good* and playing the Simulated Universe.I REALLY Love this game, it has amazing characters and combat.It is very f2p and is just a fun game.",Positive
"THIS IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY OPINION!! Everything, the lore, the plot and even the fights, the character designs everything is just so perfect about this game!! And both the MCs are just my favourite, overall the best mihoyo game <33",Positive
"I know this game is early and has been many problems of bugs, freeze, lagging, and hang on the game., I hope in the Full version update has been fixed and I hope mihoyo for this game for optimization please.",Negative
"Best game ever <3, decent amount of gb, I love the way its kinda openworld whereas still being turn based its just awesome how well hoyoverse treats honkai to genshin! No improvements needed!",Positive
"I downloaded the game, but for some reason, I couldn't actually start it. I kept getting a login error (1001_5 I'm pretty sure). It's pretty upsetting I couldn't download it, since I was really excited for it.",Negative
"Wonderful game, love how generous the rewards are. Biggest compaint is that it majorly heats up my phone and is a battery hog.",Positive
The Best turn based rpg game.,Positive
I would like to see more main story and side quest opportunities. Genshin was awesome for it cause you'd never be bored. This game is still new and I recommend it to everyone. But I'm waiting on the updates now lol. So please hurry.,Positive
I love how unlike genshin we come across playable characters more plus the features and tools make the playing experience for fun. Also i love how many rewards there are,Positive
"Turn based game, more generous gacha than the other games by the same company. As of 1.2 it's still very new so of course not a lot of content is still out but as much of the story as we've seen... it's pretty interesting.",Positive
"Too grindy. The ""honkai"" in the title feels like a bait-and-switch. The combat being a so-so turn based thing feels like a misstep",Negative
"Great characters, would roll again. Maybe combat could be added other elements so that it would feel more fast paced.",Positive
"It's a fun game don't get me wrong, and it's generous but out of 47 playable characters there is only 1 character that has dark skin and the way that most of these characters that that have dark skin, hoyo has are either given horrible treatment",Negative
"can you please fix the game i cant login on my account because it keeps on saying ""too many requests"" even if i tried changing my password it still won't let me in.",Negative
"I've gotten great experiences playing this game, if you don't like playing turn based games then this might not be for you. Customer service is great and will help you with any problem you're dealing with. It's a really fun game, but if they could, I would try adding the co-op gameplay like in genshin",Positive
Geat graphics. Gameplay is nothing new. Story is rush for some unknown reason. And all contents is repetitive.,Negative
"Miyoho learned a lot from Genshin Impact. The gacha is much more giving with the pity system being far more merciful. You don't have to wait till a certain day of the week to get that mat you need. Premium currency is easier to earn. The Persona style gameplay, music, art style, sound effects, and visuals are fantastic. If I had any complaints, it would be some of the translations and dialog feels off, and npcs are a little too generic copy-paste. (baby faced old people make me cringe)",Positive
They make the simulated to hard and i can get pass it after try it like 10 time fuvk this game,Positive
Its very laggy and fps drops randomly and after some time it drops to 0 cpu and gpu bcs it is badly optimized especially low-mid end phones gets so many fps drops and game wants more cpu and gpu than it needs bcs of that it needs optimization without that it is really hard to play bcs you need to reopen the app every 15 mins so it stops it i hope they fix it before giving new content.,Negative
"This game is amazing! The animation, characters and story is just so good, sometimes laggy or screen freezes but its still amazing!",Positive
"Absolutely STUNNING! I love almost everything in the game! It also includes many things from Honkai Impact! Turn based RPG may not be for everyone, but for a regular player like me, this is amazing and fun! I'm already a HUGE FAN! I will stay by this game for a longgg time, keep up the awesomeness!",Positive
"Game is quite fantastic, graphics and content wise. And Mihoyo reputation of previous game make me mistakenly confident for this game.Each new character is powerful than previous one, is common occurance in gacha game, but is was faster than other Mihoyo game I play, and honestly a bit unexpected. Last event streaming related is so bad, invisible limited reward that than depleted so fast, Not sure why in the world they have tendency of limited ingame-currency reward like it actually real money.",Negative
Five star all the way just like skz's album five star one of my most fav game yes yes yes I luv luv it.,Positive
Interesting storyline and also very funny characters,Positive
"It'd been 6days since I downloaded this game and i am already addicted. The story is immersive and the gameplay and characters are fun to use. The rewards are given very well so its not very money dependent, you can play it completely f2p and still enjoy it",Positive
"Fun game, good single player experience with turn based action. Good voice acting and story. Just like most gatcha games, grinding for advancement is ever present.",Positive
While the game is beautiful. Just like genshin I had to uninstall due to the fact you CANNOT change your characters appearance. Thats everything for me..they should play fortnite to learn people want to be unique and show off with friends,Negative
"Initially thought it was okay despite the rude characters, but as I got up to Penacony and forced to play as a male cartoon character. I got tired of it. Not a friendly game for trans women or non-binary folk who have pronoun sensitivity.",Negative
Blatant favoritism. They'll ignore some characters and only focus on the popular units during beta. They'll nerf anything that helps older units in favor of the new popular one. And they seem to have an agenda against male units.,Negative
"Simply amazing. If you enjoy turn-based strategy games, then look no further as you will surely love this game hands down. p.s. looking forward to see new characters with the upcoming updates ! ‚ù§Ô∏è üôáüèª",Positive
"Im honestly disapointed, it said that this game is compatible with my device and yet when i install it and play it just keep getting stuck at log in screen, would just stay black, ive waited for an hour and yet it still wont move forward ü•≤",Negative
"9/10 I my book. great combat, good story The 50/50 on 5* pulls feel fair",Positive
Hello hoyoverse dev i hope you fix the issue about g88 8gb ram phones on Redmi 12 hyperos 1.0 its causing lagging even at the lowest graphivs and sometimes the cutscene audio lag i hope it will optimize yhe game smoothly in the future i love playing hoyo games and i hope i can still continue to enjoy it even at low graphics with now lag thanks for your service hoyoverse honkai star rail.,Negative
"AMAZING GAME, GRAPHICS, HISTORY AND ALOT OF GOOD REWARDS(unlike genshin), it really shows how much the devs care about the game and the players(unlike genshin), every update has been a w since the start (unlike genshin) i love all the characters and the designs everything is awesome and its a very chill and casual game overall",Positive
"The game is always crashing on my new phone (Samsung S23 FE), I don't why it is happening :( I play this game on my old phone (Xiaomi 11T) and it works perfectly.",Negative
The game is fantastic and is exactly what it says it is on the tin. I think people giving it low scoring reviews because its a turn-based game are doing the game and themselves a disservice.,Positive
"[Dropped] Worse gacha than genshin lol. It come with auto battle which is good because the fight is boring; 7-8 type of hero combine with 7-8 type of char element apparently for the sake of making more character; roll rate just as bad as genshin with basically the same pricing mechanism; barely obtainable ticket-wish (3 hours into game and I only get around 500 gems for 3 wish, need 10 wish for a guarantee 4 star char or weapon and I assume the same 90 for a 5 star character).",Negative
This game crushes often whenever I enter combat. This didn't happen before 2.0 update. If it can be solved then please do so,Positive
The story and gameplay is pretty fun. I really liked this game but it took too much of my poor phone's storage. I'll definitely install on computer one day.,Positive
Been playing since launce and have been enjoying it since.,Positive
Best Mihoyo Gacha so far...and this is from someone that wasn't a fan of turn based games,Positive
Top up issue clearly a scumhoyo issue which will cost me the next 2 banner characters nothing being done about it stingy as any other scumhoyo game I've played hence why I'll miss the next 2 characters since they don't even give a small fraction of what's needed to lose the 50/50 let alone get a unit would give it a 0* if I could just because of that nothing about it is good enough to make up for this issue but what can you expect from a company like mihoyo ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Negative
"I love this game, really. However, there is next to no skin tone diversity. And while there are (some) dark-skinned NPCs, the only current playable character with some melanin is Arlan, yet he is the worst meta-wise. (There have been teasers about Sugilite, but that only makes 2 out of 50+ characters...) Please change this.",Negative
The Graphics and story lines are top tier however the only problem for me is that a vvv long dialogue that sometimes I'm too bored to read hehe,Negative
"This is currently my favorite game! Amazing character design, beautiful story and very very generous rewards!",Positive
"I love the gameplay and style, but i rate this as a 3 star because i couldn't play in my mobile phone, i kept getting the error code 1001_3 and tried everything to fix it. i usually play on pc but i want to experience honkai star rail in mobile too.",Negative
The game is super amazing even my friends play this game I like sa design of the characters and the event are also good I even got firefly in my first full,Positive
"Mihoyo yet delivered another high quality gacha game and continue to prove that they are at the top of gacha market right now with great characters designs, great music, top tier animation, sound designs... It's definitely not a masterpiece by any means, but as a gacha game, this game is just blowing away any gacha games out there on the market rn with how much budget went into making this. And to me, this game is just a better genshin so yes highly recommend it",Positive
"I love the game! The story is nice and well-put-together, and it's fun to interact with random objects. Only downside is that it warms my phone up like crazy.",Positive
Aventurine boss sucks if you don't have the necessary luck and good team.,Negative
Its a really interesting and fun to play Game but the roll of relics kinda bit bad im not gonna blame the game itself but its kinda bit off My point here is please fix the roll of relics its hard for us beginners to have a proper relics and ended up getting 2-3 digit dmg only,Positive
no skip button. I guess I don't need to continue this game.,Negative
It is fun and the story is very good so far. Its turn based unlike Genshin impact. Also the is a lot if QoL in this game that Genshin never got so far. The music in the first big boss fight is very good.,Positive
This deserve game of the year award Seriously Man i never play any game like that one every thing in this game fantastic but if only they released a banner for Firefly i would be happier And thank you,Positive
"The greatest feature I have experienced in this game is the cross-platforming gameplay. You can play either in your PC or your phone. To the people who made this game, you all did a good job.",Positive
Turn based makes you think and plan out your attack and the graphics where AWESOME and all the characters were so nice and I think it's such a good game that's why I give it a 5/5,Positive
"Enjoying the game a lot, the characters, story, combat, writing, interactions, etc . Have been improved a lot since genshin. Loving it so far might just become my no. 1 game. Also march o Is soo cute and adorable",Positive
My trailblazer lvl is still low so I can't really say much rn but so far it's been great. I can afk farm (my fav part) although the character building is a bit confusing I'm sure I'll understand it later in the game. But so far rn it's great,Positive
I tried to make the graphics high but it turns all white when i does it. Overall it was a fun game! I really enoyed it. I just hope anyone could fix it ü•≤,Positive
"When you play first time, its very fun and entertaining, but when you reach trailblaze level 65, the game is repetitive and boring. For story its good and its the only reason for me to play the game",Positive
So far games pretty good. I look forward to seeing new banners in the future. I love how hoyo allows people to select there own 5* banners when they warp 300 time ( 1 time thing). Only thing I don't like is how the daily quest don't give you frags for warping.,Positive
"Honestly, it's an extremely fun game with fun, a great story, and simple combat, but some good puzzles and exploration love the characters too",Positive
"A phenomenal game with spectacular graphics, gameplay, character designs and basically everything you could ask for is well made.",Positive
"The game is excellent and extremely addicting, we may encounter a lot of bugs and glitches but still the game is super fun.",Positive
Absolutely amazing and beautiful game. Hats off to the creators for creating and giving us this truly beautiful game to enjoy.,Positive
I have an account on my pc and wanna play it on phone so i can continue it but cant seem like its obligate me to restart when i have an account for years.,Negative
"Good story, good Characters, simple yet fun gameplay.. And the most important thing, They're not stingy like another game... As f2p I enjoy my time so much!",Positive
"Love this game! The art style, the gui, the lore till now, the character design and the voice lines! Would like a feature of letting the players know where the other NPC playable characters currently are, so yk just wander",Positive
I played it but it takes so long to load. I'm trying to go on it on the phone but it never works that just takes long... But I still like the game,Positive
Keeps crashing whenever I start a battle and leaves the game the reason is the game is forcing me to download the full resource like it's still gonna crash,Negative
"Amazing gameplay, music, level and character design, and an engaging story. Just like with their past games, just play and it's f2p friendly",Positive
"Lost my account, well it's certainly not the most expensive account but this game actually hook me for a bit and planning to progress even more, just to realised my account is gone. Have tried every Gmail/FB I have but come to a dead end of first cut scene,ask my friend and he told me that I didn't bind my account.... Damn",Negative
"Honkai Star Rail is a great game because of its stunning graphics, engaging storyline, and exciting gameplay. With a diverse cast of characters, challenging missions, and frequent updates, it offers endless hours of entertainment for players. Its community-driven events and supportive player base also make it a fantastic social experience. Anyways, one star",Negative
"Not as good as Genshin, and story is a bit scattered. But music and graphics are prettt good nonetheless. Great job Mihoyo.",Positive
"Very cool game and cool characters better rewards than genshin but plz add ""delete past resources"" like genshin it takes too much space and let us delete unwanted files plz",Positive
really needs to fix the storage issue. they literally use more storage than a 4 year old game that they've previously made.,Negative
"I really like this game, but I am not in a high level yet, and is really fun",Positive
"Absolutely fantastic game , I'm sure my YouTube subscribers are enjoying it too , sampo koske really is the star of the first planet, teamed up with Dan heng for the ultimate wind damage dominance üëãü•¥",Positive
"this game is really fun!! dialogue options are funny, lore is interesting, the turn based combat being fun (i thought it would be boring but i was completely wrong!) the characters are all very fun too!",Positive
"The premise of the game seems interesting. The gameplay and visual are also quite good. It is like Genshin Impact in space. Sadly, there is no emergency food. ;)",Positive
Simple and easy hoyo quality turn base game,Positive
My favorite game for the company by far. Engaging story and easy to follow even if you don't listen to every instruction. Plus the characters are super attractive lolol,Positive
"It's an absolutely brilliant game if you like turn based action stretagy games, with amazing graphics and a storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat...",Positive
The game has its own difficulty curve and the story it features is fabulous! Keep up the work!,Positive
I love the game and it's super fun but I'm really upset about the fact that after about 1 week of being innactive on the app my account didn't work? I went back to play and it wouldn't let me log in so I lost ALL progress.,Positive
"Very fun to play, I had already beat other games graphics",Positive
Fix your damn login problem. I have a pretty good and stable internet connection and yet I'm having trouble loggin in the game 8 times out of 10. What is this? Its so annoying having to try to relogin so many times just to fail.,Positive
"Simply doesn't connect to the servers reliably. I consistently get the error code 1001_03. Sure, it's a free-to-play game, but when you release any product it should have been properly QCd. Shoddy work, miHoyo. Shoddy work.",Negative
"The game typically fails to launch with no error displayed. There are lots of downloads that do not improve anything. I'm giving up and deleting this unready for release ""game"" the stupid game NEVER starts! It makes me wonder if this is a false fame and is some kind of hacker or spy bot!",Negative
Ill say i love how the developers treat the players its f2p friendly fr that just makes me wanna spend more money on this game because i know ill be treated well so ill spned more money because they treat us like spoiled kids! Also very fun game 100% would recommend!,Positive
Game is amazing a I love it. But after I changed phone it doesnt work with the newest update. Please fix.... i want to go to penocony üò≠üò≠üò≠,Negative
"Great game but I lost 2 50/50s in a row, automatic L",Positive
"I like Star Rail a lot more than I like Genshin. But sadly, I don't have time to play the game like before. Just once a while. I hope they keep the quality and the rewards generousity forever.",Positive
I have facing a issue while playing the game my mobile screen was freeze and when I playing on medium and high settings the game environment get completely white except character please solve this issue I was playing on redmi note 11 4 GB ram and 64 GB storage.,Negative
Beautiful graphics and gameplay. Characters are awesome. Little in depth at first,Positive
"Nice graphic, nice cinematic, nice story, good gameplay, reasonable gacha rate, quite generous for F2P. Keep up the good work!!!",Positive
"Everything in this game is awesome, but im bugged on a dialog screen without any dialog and im stuck there, i just cannot play please fix it",Positive
Jeez man power creep in this game gets worse by the time not only that but this lacks interaction with characters like I got through the Hussle of Getting the character can I do anything with them only than just stand there,Negative
I downloaded the game from one of the ads promising 80 free wishes for signing up and didn't receive them :( not sure if it was a scam or I just didn't receive them. The game is fun to play but I did want those free wishes,Positive
I love this game but my biggest issue is the trail blaze power...once it runs out u gotta wait a whole 16 hours before it is regenerated. I could understand if it was to prevent the kids from being on the game all day. However what about us adults that know the difference between games and reality. Most adults know they have responsibilities. Why can't we just play and farm our material without worrying about energy??,Positive
"Gameplay visuals are amazing, combat system is easy and fast paced, story is better than genshins and characters are very unique and lovable.",Positive
"EXTREMELY SLOW PROGRESSING GAME. Can't skip cutscenes. no auto walking. can't skip conversations. has boring quests like hide and seek... SUMMON RATES ARE HORRIBLE. RARELY GET SUMMON CURRENCY. overall, disappointed with game. If they allowed for skips and ways to acquire more summon tickets my rating will go up exponentially.",Negative
"Game Optimization needed, The game itself is almost as big as the PC version 2.0 Update is around 25gb This is big for an Android Devices.",Negative
"Like the game, good characters and easy to follow plot. But, I swear I will strangle the one who decided to make Trotter an enemy, it's too cute to hurt!",Negative
I love the character designs and the whole world adventuring on beta server. I just cant log in the game because it says error log in try again later so I will give it a 3 star as of the moment.,Negative
"Out of all the turn-based rpg games I've played, this is by far the BEST I've ever played on this genre. I love how Hoyoverse turns a simple mechanic into such a fun adventure with loads of progress!",Positive
"Here's a game that comes up with a solid core gameplay and story, then proceeds to suck as much fun out and limit you from playing to about 10 mins a day purely for simple greed. It's pretty sad the level of self sabatoge that occurred here.",Negative
Cool game. Didn't know a train could use stars as rails üî•üî•üî•üó£üó£üó£,Positive
"Can't login anymore ,the train at loading screen is glitch ,reinstalled 3x ,reverify files 7x ,login error all the time ,no vpn ,internet cignal about 70% speed... v1.1 sucks...Redownload v1.2... nothing solve still unable to login ,tried 3 other devices still all glitch version... is my adress/home ban to play this game? ps:I'm not trolling ,players like us are ignored",Negative
The game is great but when i played it it always give me log in error and went im on the train with pom pom march himeko and welt it started to glitch idk why it always glitch maybe its they wifi or phone but if that happens in the game im sorry but im reinstall it again to try if the glitch is gonna come back or not hopefully not,Positive
"Aside from the environment graphics breaking and not loading properly on the phone (I play on laptop instead) (please fix this), every aspect of the game is really fun, and I look forward to what happens next in the Trailblaze Missions! (give me imbibitor lunae or i kidnap you)",Positive
"Litterally an amazing game, actually cares about their playerbase, frequent updates, and rewards. I've played GI, Hi3, and now hsr, and I can say hsr is my favorite. Although I think the guy who overcomplicated the xianzhou lore and was misogynistic should have his position rethought.",Positive
"Kinda fun... Not really.. Well, it was",Negative
"Money hungry, deleted twice, re uploaded because they are claiming 80 free pulls and it's bs. As it is only 5 star and up charcter( with supper low rates) will push you through the late game. That's only if you have dues. I recommend Eternal Evolution better as at least it give an easy pitty to reach and dup alternative.",Negative
Just a yes everything is so compact with emotions and whatever you choose certainly affects the entire plot of the side quest to the main quest.,Positive
"Im so sick and tierd of turn based combat games unless its Pok√©mon its gonna be boring and overly repetitive, every other mobile game is just a turn based combat game. And on top of that it's a gatcha game meaning it doesn't respect your time and effort unless you pay heavy amounts of money. Gameplay is not unique at all every anime style game on mobile apart from a few like guardian tales and Arkham Knights gave the same turn based combat system. art style and sound design is good.",Negative
"before the 1.1 update it's good but after the update it's gotten so bad i have to delete the game, it's too laggy and the train is always missing i spent 2hrs from the loading screen and it's too laggy the walls are gone, it sucks because the game is so good and much better than honkai and genshin hopefully mihoyo fix the game.",Negative
I dont like the way you have to fight i was hoping for it to be a more open world fighting. I dont like how you have to fight in a turn based fight style it makes it a lot less fun to play.,Negative
The game is good I don't like turn based games that much but this one is really cool because you can explore and it's 3d also the story and animation is really really cool,Positive
"this getting out of hand now. 1- the art style is sooo repetitive and genetic, literally +50 games looks like this one now on the market, no creativity what so ever, not even trying 2- graphics are very last gen 2014 graphics literally. they are way worse than genshin impact despite it being turned based, it should be the opposite but nope. 3- story is so numbing terrible, character is the boring silent protagonist again. 4- gacha system is extremely repetitive",Negative
"I like the design style for the characters and world concept, and the choice of music suitable for each region",Positive
It's... very basic gameplay. Feels fairly soulless without investing a ton of money into the gambling aspect. UI and many systems being copy-paste from Genshin is also unfortunate. It's a fine game but bland and generic.,Negative
"This game is ABSOLUTELY one of my favorite mobile games I've played. I've never seen so many cooly designed characters in a while! My favorite characters right now are Dan Heng, Herta, Asta, and March 17. I'm enjoying it so far!",Positive
"This game is so good! It's worth your time and kind of additing! The story is good, the art style is brilliant, and the graphics are great! The game is also generous!",Positive
LOVE THE GAME!! tho idk maybe it‚Äôs just me but i feel like this game is heavier than genshin since i can run genshin just fine without lag in my phone but it‚Äôs lagging pretty bad with this game. hope the dev will continue to optimize this game since i want to continue playing for a long time,Positive
"Amazing game, characters, story, graphics. Thanks hoyoverse for this awesome game. Just let me win the next 5050 please ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫",Positive
everytime i switch or upgrading relics/lightcone the screen freezes with a blank.. fix it and maybe i give it a 5 star rating..,Negative
This game very good. I love it. Firefly please come home,Positive
This is a great game i would like to rate it 4 or 5 star but the only reason for 2 star is that it's a turn base game that annoys me...If it fighting style was like genshin impact then i would definitely like it more than genshin....overall its a good game but its not for me...,Negative
I say it is a good game since I played it on the laptop but on the phone the map is not there nor the train I am using Lenovo k12(android) and it has many games working on it so please fix this problem,Negative
"Ive played the 20 mins gameplay until I get to the most interesting part ""The Gacha System"". I think its still awful like genshin is. Rewards for pre register was trash all along. Why not give a 5 star guaranteed for the first pull and. Players will only make new account until they got what they wanted. You only wasting time if we are re rolling until we get one 5 star. If you are tired of Genshin this game will burn you off sooner or later. I try to give this game a chance but it disappoints me",Negative
"Very good game,the Jades are easy to get while also having guaranteed a 5 star every patch so I can confidently say that this is the most friendly gacha game out there. Good gameplay that they update every patch to keep the fights fresh and a very good Development Team.",Positive
"Very good game and runs smoothly, but the only problem is that the bosses aren't f2p friendly, it's hard to beat lvl 58 bosses with lvl 60 characters",Negative
A lot of bugs and many times the graphics break down. The phone does not even stand up to the game at low. It keeps stuttering and crashing out of the game,Negative
Best storyline and turn based gameplay.... But im literaly getting 1 fps on the game after i reached xianzhou luofu ... My phone is using snapdragon 870 so it should be handiling it quiet well but this sucks,Negative
"Great work! Gets somewhat repetitive at times, but there also a lot of great games out there in general. Can you folks add controller support? Would love to use my Backbone to play this game. Thanks!",Positive
"Amazing so far, but the secret toilet quest is broken :[ it keeps teleporting me to different areas, but doesn't allow me to interact again. Also, the scared researcher is no where to be seen.",Positive
My phone keeps crashing when i play for like 30 minutes but on genshin even i play 6 hours; its still in the best condition. I will change my review when the game is optimized on all devices like genshin,Negative
"I allways hated turn based games but this game is just better than the others, also the graphics are actually 3D unlike other mobile games.",Positive
"I love everything about this game, but is there any way to make the text for dialogues a bit bigger? My eyes cannot stop hurting when I tried to read the longer dialogues because it's a little small üò≠üôè",Positive
"Pretty good game, cool story, nice eng voice acting, and interesting gameplay. Game is great, but this game is a gacha game (-1 star). However, if you don't mind playing gacha games, this would be one of the better ones. Ps. I have Samsung s22 ultra.",Positive
"I love this game, please add more events to make it more exciting",Positive
One of the best games ever played the story is beautiful and the gameplay is awesome. Must play game trust me u will not regretüòÅ,Positive
"I expected it to be like other Honkai or like a scifi Genshin. I dislike turn-based like jrpg's, it's one of the few things I can't overlook, so I had to uninstall. Get back to me when you make something new like Genshin but with more character customization, less p2w/random pulling for characters. Gonna keep waiting for somebody to get the formula right.",Negative
"The invisble Sampo poster needs to be fixed that's all, otherwise it's a kickass game needs more optimisation for phone users though, a bit laggy on some cut scenes.",Positive
"One of the best turn-based game that i have ever played, after Persona 3 and Persona 4. I really love the story, the characters and their design. It is literally the only game that i always play almost every day since three months ago.",Positive
"Genuinely fun, it's a Gacha that respects your time too. Very engaging, the story is actually interesting, characters that you can care about. It's definitely a game that you can play F2P forever, the devs are constantly updating the game and giving out free stuff.",Positive
Has really good bones is a game but the constant updates,Positive
"The best turn based RPG I've ever played the characters, Design, Music, Voice acting everything Is just Perfect also Alot of new content in every new patch Definitely recommend to everyone",Positive
Great fun overall and a nice storyline. The gatcha mechanics are the same as Genshin really but overall it's still viable F2P. Hope to see good additional updates as time goes on.,Positive
This game is actually amazing compare to genshin impact but i still play it But please make more events to play,Positive
I love the game but there no delete quest like genshin the hsr is 21gb now and genshin is 18 like I can't play them both now since I don't have any storage now I hope you put also just like genshin plsss I love this both games I don't want to delete them plsss,Negative
"Disappointed with the accessibility. I try to download this fame every time, but it just doesnt seem to work bwcause there's always an error when I try to launch the game here on my phone. Basically, I cantplay the game.on my phone at all.... </3",Negative
"So far this is an amazing game !! I really love the design and the gameplay. Really a mix of honkai impact and genshin impact but with it own twists. Really love this game so much and the customer service is very great ! Again, an amazing game overall !",Positive
"I've never seen a brilliant game on my phone. The plot is good, the characters are beautiful and strong. I think I'll play everything Life",Positive
Great turn base gacha with fun characters and interesting story. The setting reminds me of Mass Effect minus the actual aliens,Positive
I didnt even start to play it was it was running like garbage it was laggy and the music was also lagging somehow and ik it isnt my phone cuz my phone ran a 23GB game before so this game needs a bit of work,Negative
"Love it. The storyline is wonderfully fleshed out, the game is perfectly stable despite my unfortunately large ping, has quite a good since of humor, and I have yet to encounter a bug. Wonderful.",Positive
"After installion, i download all additional files and restart game as it forces me to. Without fail on multiple different fresh downloads it crashes every time.",Negative
"*Sigh* People nowadays are kinda ungrateful. Just enjoy the game, look at the landscapes, feel the atmosphere. Did you know? Despite its Gacha, you have already experienced a AA game ""freely"". Bruh, if it is a pure JRPG, you have to pay at least 30 bucks to get it and its storyline becomes limited. Anyways, nice work HoYo for being a great pioneer of Cross-platformed Mobile game so far. Since Genshin Impact released, there have been a lot of high quality Mobile game coming along the way.",Positive
"Well, while I love this game and it's story arc and such, I hate the fact that this company has lied to it's people for 80 free pulls from some stupid lying ad. You don't get that at all, unless you play the game and progress. Gradually, within the game maybe you'll get 80 or more... Just not right off the bat like they promised.",Negative
Really don't like how Hoyoverse does 50% limited character and 50% other 5 star characters I don't want... after 80 or 100 rolls. Other game's pity systems are better than playing with a coin of luck... Besides that... the story and characters are pretty good.,Negative
"Help, having problem making in game purchase. Keeps saying check country in play store settings. I never had this issue before",Negative
Love the game. This game is a little generous than the other one (GI),Positive
"This is by far the best game I played so far. This game has a perfect balance between fun gameplay and amazing storyline. If I can talk everything good about this game it'll take me more than 500 words, this game was the only game that I've spent so much time in (I got Kafka)",Positive
"gotta be honest, since the combat is turn based it gets very boring after a while. i wish we could just skip combat portions, since it's autoplay anyways.",Negative
"Hello im just here to say that this game changed alot when it was first realesed it was hated and mistreated but now its a great time, Great time to play because you have alot of uppertunity to catch up with the latest version's quests. This was updated!!",Positive
"So it's been many day's the game launch. My device has snapdragon 855 but it's lagging so much. I mean I also play genshin impact in 60 fps and it runs so good but I can't get the experience while I play this game when one of your game giving me such a pleasure. So nothing to say more, try to improve the game that's all.",Positive
The game is great and all but there's an issue in the loading screen it keeps saying log in error even though I have a decent internet and device I really hope that this issue will be fixed,Negative
"It's still speculations but it's one of the best rpg game online I played, but it yet to beat Final Fantasy 7 's story line, I'm still waiting for it to beat it. i expect a lot from this game. A lot",Positive
"Could you please help me! The game keeps freezing, is it only my phone? I deleted bunch of apps in my phone and also restart my phone but it keeps freezing ;-;",Positive
"The best RPG game so far! with the scenery, graphics and storyline which made the game more interesting",Positive
For those who experiencing that i takes 1-5 minutes on the loading screen (train) that depends on your divices and the network connection also / I'm gonna add also devs why this game heating up my phone quickly but genshin impact is not that quick/ also the warp thing 90 pulls is guaranteed right but why i can't that 5 star banner? Kindly explain why devs? Please respond üëç,Positive
My phone literally shuts down after every single fight. I've been playing Genshin on this phone for ages and its never had such an issue. Literally no app or game has ever caused my phone to straight up shut down. I wonder what the problem is.,Negative
"I mean this game is great at all the banner system, characters design and others but my obly problem with this game is that whenever theres a new update, i log in as simple but then i have to download everything again? yes this happened again right now, and i dont wanna waste time leaving my phone on for hours for nothing, although i may not log in for a few days and just logged in now but really? this happened i waited for my patience but when it was almost close fully downloading it crashed.",Negative
This is by far the best looking best playing game on any app store out there sure it's new and it will have some glitch but all you crybabies out there that wine all the time have not an ounce of patience.The characters are dynamic the graphics are op voice acting superb huge world and its a game its suppose to be a challenge or you would beat it on the first day whats the fun in that I give it a 4.9 out of 5 right out the gate and I've play a ton of rpgs,Positive
It's honestly a fun game to play if you really love turn based combat. Especially since I've been playing turn based games for years and it's nice to have a new game that includes gacha,Positive
"Interesting characters, great plot, cool soundtrack, superb graphics, generous devs. It is 2023's mobile game of the year for a reason.",Positive
Too much status on the boss fight and their attack becomes multiple...,Negative
"Quite fun and charming! The characters are cute, the plot is engaging, and the writing is so charming, it really is such a nice gaming experience!",Positive
"Amazing game play,character design,character voice and map design! I spent hours playing this game.",Positive
"Trying to play on S22 Ultra, game keeps crashing, can't even get through download extra data without 3 crashes.",Negative
"I'm unable to log in, I see the game getting downloaded, but then it automatically shuts down and takes me back to my home screen. What's happening?",Negative
Best game on android!!!! Keep it up.. You guys need to add a larger word update next time give us something that will last between updates And for the people that are having problems with the game follow the hardware requirements Ihave no problems on my Samsung note 10 plus 5g ....,Positive
"I tried it, didn't really care for it. Would have given it a 4 star but the adds for this game keep showing up on every video I watch, so 1 star.",Negative
"So far i have a good experience playing this game, but i hope they will add the function of deleting some old resources so i will have more storage to continue playing the game",Positive
This is game that I still play until now. Most mobile game I play become boring quickly. But this game make me hook with its nice gameplay and very smooth animation. I hope the story continuation get update soon.,Positive
"Please stop crashing my phone's system every time I exit the game. It's been bugging me for so long, and it happened 3 times now. Twice made my phone restart on it's own and I'm worried it might destroy my phone internally. Please fix this issue!",Negative
"The game is good and all, but when I tried to change my graphics from ""very low"" to ""low"", my whole screen just became white, making the game pretty much unenjoyable. What am I supposed to do about that? I tried changing the graphics back, but it's still the same.",Positive
"The store page says it works on my device. That is a complete lie. It won't go past the title screen, which runs at 2fps, on my phone (Galaxy S10+).",Negative
A very good game mechanic system just like genshin impact. But graphic setting is not fully optimized.. even the lowest setting can reach 38¬∞C for my phone.,Positive
Very fun turn based game. The characters look nice and the story can be interesting. This game is also very good at making my money disappear!!,Positive
"Love this game. The storylines are interesting, and there are no annoying adverts or constant pop-ups to purchase credits!",Positive
"After fixing the issue with my account and actually getting to play the game, I can say that this game is really fun if you like turn-based rpgs. I'd recommend it.",Positive
"Lack of exploration area, lack of content, so much difficult content... Too much for casual player like me. Good thing... Gacha system is really nice... Same system for both character and weapon. Uninstalling on phone, still play on PC for a bit longer.",Negative
"Rewriting my review, I like this and it isn't that hard to understand if you actually pay attention lol. I just wish I played this continuously from when I created my account when the game was released, other than that I wished we can replay cutscenes in archives are something I have no problems.",Positive
"I've played a lot of gacha games but this is easily one of if not the best. The production quality is insanely high, the events are fun and well thought out, rewards are generous and abundant. I have nothing but praise for it",Positive
"I never liked Genshin. I never liked Honkai Impact the 3rd. But this is a game, I believe suited me. This is real-time classic turn base game. I loved the design of every each character. Really went heart for Seele. Still wish Bronya instead of Welt tho. v.v",Positive
"This game is amazing, absolutely! I love the play style, game mechanism, the environment and most importantly the story. I'm loving this game so far. Looking forward for more contents. Good job everyone in HSR Team!",Positive
"As a genshin impact player, I really hate when the game developers decides to make 1 character broken as hell also useful such as seela and then gives jing when he is not useful at all. The gap is more than 40% for the overall usefulness, and i started the game after seele banner, and it's not fun, while all the limited character after seele are not hunt. And hunt is only useful class in game for dps other class are useless in compared to hunt for dps. Bs this is a blind spot of the developers",Negative
This game took 10 restart to finally get the scence but it was so laggy and slow that I couldn't even play please fix this.,Negative
"Awesome Game. The world designs,the music,the story,the characters,the quality of life features are simply the best in the role playing genre. 10/10 I highly recommend this game. Best Hoyoverse Game.",Positive
"Addicting. And that's coming from someone who barely plays any mobile games. Let alone a game like Honkai: Star Rail, which does feel like working a 9-5 job. And no, I didn't spend (well I did but not in the hundreds) any money and still got some powerful characters.",Positive
Great game. Having lots of fun. Levelling up characters is still very slow after you get to trail blazer 40+ but that's too be expected. Good game overall,Positive
So far I spent less dollar on the game I'm mostly f2p and I could get really good 5 star char I don't really like exploring so I left genshin when this game came out but I didn't start till 1.4 then came back in 1.5 and so far the best decision and I manage to save a lot of money I just really like games like this more,Positive
"I love Honkai: Star Rail so much!! I've been waiting for this game! I haven't experienced issues except for my bad luck, but I do hope you guys add a co op! Me and my Best friends want to play together so please do consider adding a co op. Plus, It will make it more fun. :)",Positive
"Genshin Impact is better. It takes too much time to fight in this game, and you can't just finish a battle quickly, you gotta punch, and they punch, and it's in turns. I rather have genshin, the characters are prettier, the attacks aren't slow, it's just better.",Negative
This game is great I never feel tired of playing this game if you could add the multi player function that would be awesome üëç please make a coop in star rail like genshin and we know this is better than genshin,Positive
It is one of the best games I've ever played. Non of quest are boring and was actually fun to play through! I'm excited to see more,Positive
"Fantastic game. However, I play this only on PC. Installed it on mobile just so I could rate it.",Positive
"Started it up, played for a few hours, dropped money on pulls, was having a blast. Loaded it up today and it started over from the beginning. It erased my save data and they money I spent in the in game store is wasted. A fun game ruined for me in its entirety.",Negative
"Updating my original one-star review to... one star. They continue to dilute the *paid* wish system with light cones (weapons) from off banner that are useless. Time and time again, if you spend money on this game, you'll come up with 15 copies of a light cone no one uses while only getting one or two copies of a meta character. They create and shape the meta, and then influence pulls in a way to make players feel like they need to spend more. Which is trash for a company this size.",Negative
This game is Soo much fun. All the characters are really cute and fun to play as. the story has kept me playing all the time. The only thing that would make this game better is if they update it more and add more story.,Positive
I've been experiencing alot of lags and some bugs like game crashes and sometimes the game closes by itself invisible enemies etc,Negative
"I'm stucking on a trailblazer mission on adventurine. pretty adventure wow.. Why can't just win bro?üíÄ I have upgraded everything I have. always. support is gonna died on the last phase. just let me win, Please.",Negative
"It's a great game, I just hate that whenever I try to login I get an ""login error"" usually that means I can't play until tomorrow. Honestly if someone knows how I can fix this, that would be appreciated",Negative
My star rail is not working why,Negative
"This game is the best. My favorite game so far. The story is exquisite, gameplay is great, f2p friendly, and great character designs. I'm hoping they could add more stuff to this game.",Positive
"Still bad balance, but now there are more variations in strategy that makes the gameplay more interesting.",Negative
"same old mihoyo game tedious grind. Game's beautiful though! story, character designs, and visuals.",Positive
"I honestly love this game very much! The storyline was really interesting, and sometimes it takes some time for me to understand it. The characters designs are very pretty!",Positive
So this is what it's like to be the favourite child!,Positive
THIS GAME HAVE EVERYTHING!!!! I never seen game like this on mobile... Really a nice feature. New game genre with breath taking view. This game also have memes like rick roll. And many easter egg. I always love games like JRPG and turn based. THIS GAME IS WORTH A TRY!!!,Positive
when i downloaded it i had to wait for the data download it was a long time and when i was playing it popped out a note so i clicked it and again i had to download data recourses please fix the game,Negative
I really liked the game but you need soo much room to keep the game and sometimes it just stops and then goes right off the game on its own,Positive
My favorite game in the world! I love every charecter in star rail!,Positive
"Very few free gacha. But the main issue is unskippable story and cutscene. The story is good, but can we just skip when some character raise their hand for 10 second?",Negative
"I love this game sm!I'm practically addicted to it atp.The characters are unique and I love their designs!Saving in this game is way easier and u can alr get the character u want with 70 pulls,totally recommended this game",Positive
"Beautiful Game! Exceptional Character designs, story is also very good, It is the Creme de la Creme of Gacha!! <3",Positive
My gameplay are so bad I can't even see anything from my world and can't finish any quests because of my gameplay please fix this issue,Negative
"I did not even download these app. I am not sure when these is downloaded to my phone but it just suddenly popped out in my playstore that it says (installed) while i am searching for a game. But when i opened it, it won't even play. It's not even in downloading and it says it's updated. So, why am i only seeing the train, moon and rocks in the galaxy rotating?",Negative
"It's laggy all of the sudden, this new update or version seems laggy, not too much but enough to make you angry sometimes. This game really needed a fix. It's spoil the fun of the game for me.",Positive
"I've played genshin so I'm kinda familiar with some mechanics of the game. I was at first hesistant when I found that it was turn based. Then as I played I found out that I actually like it. Some of the features suits me more than genshin, now I spend more time on it.",Positive
"You'll be surprised to know that their customer service is incredibly awful. Sometimes we forget that, behind all the pretty designs and cute animations, there are just greedy people working to get our money. I hope that other players don't have the same disappointing experience that I got. But it wouldn't be fair not to warn them.",Negative
"No pvp, no content to play with friends, hard gate on how much you can play in a day even though it's purely single player lmao. Story and combat is great but there's nothing to do or compete for in the game, while that works in genshin because it has open world exploration it does not work here.",Negative
"I really like the game ever since its release! They never fails to surprise players with QOLs, rewards and compensations. Every update is really a thing to watch!! Easy 5 stars!!! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",Positive
"This is the absolute best mobile gacha game! Lots of QoL updates. Have a better gacha system. Provides ""TRUE ENDGAME"" contents for you to enjoy your characters you spend a lot of time building and grinding. Always gives good rewards every patch. I could only ask for it to continue to further improve. Thanks HSR Devs!",Positive
"Sadly gave up after over an hour babysitting the massive secondary download. Initial game download went fine, 14% of ""actual "" game download after 65 minutes. Tried again a few hours later. Same. I know it's the weekend, but invest in some better servers. Successfully downloaded and started two other large games immediately after, so problem isn't my phone. Uninstalling",Negative
"It's great but overall the quality effect of the game it's just not worth it, i tried playing on High Quality but it gives me only white screen, i hope you can fix this.",Negative
"Best game!!! Good reward, nice graphics, good gameplay,.. Literally one of the best game.. Deserve to get an award! ‚ô•Ô∏è",Positive
"I get that it's a big game, but it literally takes 12 hours to download the full content, even with high+speed internet.",Negative
"Fun and visually appealing gameplay, but more importantly, fascinating storyline. Looking forward to the future!",Positive
"Absolutely love the game. Tho I consider it's a bit slow the whole thing of progressing at first, it becomes boring. It's a lot more interesting and fun later on",Positive
Star rail is very fun and exciting even though I only have played it for a day. It is similar to genshin but instead of just fighting things without it getting the chance to hit you it is turn based,Positive
Hoping that this game last longer than other gacha game this is actually good i like how the story goes and more surprising events some are hidden if you dont explore the map carefully you might miss those and those funny lines of mc whoever made it your genius. Keep up the good work trailblazers.,Positive
"Absolutely beautiful, from the characters to the story. Very easy to play and grind, also generous. Keep up the amazing work.",Positive
"Recommend this to anyone who wants to kill time, can be played in pc and phone Story is amazing, can fully immerse yourself with the characters back story The aesthetic is top tier Unique character designs",Positive
Keeps lagging and freezing on my s22+ which it shouldn't do because I have so much space on my phone and other games don't freeze.,Negative
"Very amazing game, great graphics,very cool interaction and battles I'm amazed I can't have a glitch after playing this game for long",Positive

Lowkey need more of the trailblazing journey,Positive
"It didn't even work! I tried signing in but it didn't let me! And I'm furious about the point that I have to enter the words that I heard or saw but it still didn't work. If you remove that part and just let the game be easier to get into then I will be thankful. Also, this game takes a LOT of mb and causes a lot of problems to my device. Don't download this game until they remove the amount of mg they take! This is worse than honkai impact!",Negative
"I just downloaded it today, its really fun, highly recommend for people who tired of boring open world games, this game is great and less boring (thanks for free 5 stars üôèüôèüòî)",Positive
"GREAT GAME BUT DURING THE SUNDAY FIGHT IN THE LAST BATTLE, IT KEPT GLITCHING AND WOULDNT LET ME PRESS ANY BUTTONS :( I HAD TO RESTART THE BATTLE BECAUSE OF IT",Negative
"Other than the Gacha rates and time gating (2 big cons i will admit), a perfect mobile game. Great story, characters, progression, and i genuinely want to play more after 40+ hours.",Positive
Repetitive skill burst audio in fights sometimes very anonying also it would be perfect if the gameplay same like HI3 open world. turn-based is super cringe & boring! i cant even dodge attacks,Negative
"ok, why is this in my phone when I didn't download it?? I'm the only one who knows my pass, no one knows even my relatives. Anyway, I played it with high cell phone performance, (iphone14promax) brand new, it's so laggy? I tried downloading but when it finished it says ‚Äúsorry, internet connection is not connected‚Äù when it is?? And I tried going on tiktok, internet works perfectly fine, days ago I decided to check this game, it automatically opened and all downloaded impacts. Played it, horrible.",Negative
"Perfect, even tho de fithing style is very boring.",Positive
"best game ever. amazing story, generous rewards, awesome characters, and immersive gameplay. nothing to complain about aside from the release of too many likable characters lol",Positive
"I've participated in the second Beta Test, and I can say that this game is actually good (side note, this game isn't connected to the main Honkai Universe story, so yeah. Himeko is alive) Story: 9.8/10 Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Audio/Music: 8.7/10 Map: 9.8/10 Characters: 8.5/10 Device that I use: Samsung A52, Snapdragon 732G, 256GB storage, 8GB RAM",Positive
Devs are starting to implement too much yapping in dialogue that is unskippable and contributes nothing to the story. Im here to play game not to read a book. Thank god theres new gacha games coming and this game will fell off just like genshin already did.,Negative
"I,ve really love this game but after the recent update I,ve been waiting around almost 3 hour for that game to open it's stuck on the loading screen , but still the same after I close the game and open it back still the same, why guys why ,I've played since it came out before this it's never happened like this",Negative
"An other copy of genshin, but other story and combat system. Still it's easier and takes less time than genshin. A nice game to spend time in.",Positive
"The game is awesome it has a nice pity pull system, (same as genshins basically). I get being f2p but if u even spend 5$ a month and play daily, and if u don't buy energy at all, the game gives enough stellagems to do a daily pull.",Positive
"Fun at first yeah but it's the same scenario for genshin I got impatient waiting for the story and dropped it, really love the game",Negative
"Personally, i like the game but i think Hoyoverse should fix the warp bug. You see, a day after i redownload it, whenever i click warp section, the game kick me out of it.",Positive
"I love turn based games and this scratches that itch so far. Beautiful characters, animations, and I like how everyone doesn't talk like their academic scholars. Kinda bummed about the gacha system though just like Genshin :(",Positive
"By far the generous gacha game i ever played. Besides the graphics and the story, the gameplay is surprisingly enjoyable.",Positive
"Love the game but the lag.... ISTG the lag gets on my nerves and the game crashing please fix this we all wanted to play the game, my phone is suitable for this but it keeps on crashing and lagging all over and over againüòî",Negative
"No text and scene skips... Too time consuming and too expensive just to get a proper gears and character to unlock.. Maybe gacha games was really not for me stop playing all from HI3, GI and this",Negative
"After the downloading all resources, keeping it updated... Login error still occured even when it uninstall and re-install the game... Sadly its still going on and some of players relate on itüòî",Negative
"all the graphics are good, the stories, characthers and everything but just need 1 thing the Co-op experience so that the player could play with other player",Positive
"game is good, except I lost 50/50 every 5 star pull this needs to be fixed I hate pulling a character from the unlimited banner because I don't like the characters in there",Positive
Login issues can't login no matter how hard I tried,Negative
I got to play the game a Few times but after I hadn't played for a while the game want to download and it takes so long no one is waiting 20 mins to play a quick game on their phone so I actually just can't get into the game the game was alright when I was in it.,Negative
"I personally like the game. The story is interesting, the designs for characters and the scenery are amazing, but I'm still getting used to the fighting style. Other than that, it's great, I recommend.",Positive
"Game was fantastic. But. Since the last update, the game crashes constantly.It's impossiblee to play. Please fix this issue and I'll change my rating. Otherwise it's now a 1 star",Negative
This game is amazing so fun great story line and all the characters have unique ability's and you get many extremely good rewards once you finish a quest but and the quality is amazing so defenetly recommend this game.,Positive
"Just no. This game is a huge waste of time, takes too long to get the 1600 of the premium currency for a multi-summon and then you'll get nothing from it. Characters aren't really that interesting and seem to only serve the purpose of fan-service.",Negative
"Graphics are good The game play is good But one thing I don't like is the fighting scene you can't just freely hit your enemy, I don't like ""wait your turn to hit /fight your enemy"" I hope devs will change that just like genshin impact gameplay",Negative
"It's pretty good! though it's a big laggy on my phone, otherwise I love the graphics, gameplay, character, etc.",Positive
"For some reason, app crashes all the time, and I don't think it's a device problem. I have samsung S22 Ultra",Negative
"awful game. it has long stories that can't be skipped (most of the story is not really relevant, and I waste more than half my time on the story instead of the gameplay because I can't skip it), no pvp, and difficult to get summons. the only good thing is the animation. sadly the gameplay sucks",Negative
"Fun,cute,turn based, interesting story.",Positive
Would prefer to give it NO stars at all but won't post so just gave it one star. Got tired of seeing it pop up through YouTube ads constantly basically forcing me to try and play it. Downloaded the game and its endlessly stuck on the main screen of what looks like a train going through space. Probably a greedy cash grab game anyway,Negative
"I'm a huge fan of Genshin Impact, so I tried Star Rail. I loved it even more until I found out that Star Rail is eating my data like it's nothing. Massive data drainage, I tell you. Found out I'm not the only one who experiences this problem... I'm Uninstalling until this issue is fixed. Was so hoping to spend my 12k gems I grinded and paid for.",Negative
"The storytelling is not my style, except that it's perfect",Positive
"Honestly really good! I was really skeptical about the turn based combat but its pretty chill, beautiful art and music. Keep at it!",Positive
"Best turn based RPG game of all time I've ever played! More events, jades, stories/adventure to come. Thank you HSR for making the best game ever.",Positive
Love the game. Once they fix the lag and crashinh from the 2.1(?) update I'll update this to a 5.,Positive
"I can pretty much play it now but The Walls the Doors The floors keeps on disappearing And the game mostly kick me out and return me to my home screen, But overall all thank you for Fixing the previous problem keep up the good work‚ô•Ô∏èü•≥ü•≥",Positive
"I used to play genshin, but look at this! Its so much more fun, battle fields, and unique monsters! :3",Positive
Ever since this new 2.0 the game is always error this and error that. And suddenly when I'm playing it's loading like bruh? MY INTERNET CONNECTION IS FINE!!!,Negative
"very cool gameplay, similar to final fantasy 10. It's not an open world, but it doesn't matter. Open world is getting boring after a while",Positive
The best game in mobile history,Positive
Fix your game!! The story and characters is so good but it crashes A LOT I can't even play it anymore bc it just shows black screen on pc and no graphics on the phone,Negative
Time to give this game a one star. Best thing about this game turned based combat and puzzles. Major issue... Story can be quickly done. Extremely short. Events they release is a major snoozefest. Oh better yet faulty locked events. Part 3 of the museum should've been released at this reset time then tells me another 24 hours. Gtfo. Oh and gacha rates. 0.5% 5 star. Ya most def your getting a one star lol.,Negative
Great game but could be 5 star if they gave us an option to uninstall finished quests and events to reduce the game size,Positive
"Unlike Genshin impact, you can tell the developers actually care about players, with all the qol, the events and respect for our time. I love this game so much!",Positive
"I can not give this any higher as I can not load into the game. Even after downloading the 7 GB, it just gets stuck on the space train screen, and I can't play.",Negative
"The final war of v2.2 is very epic and majestic.When robin song comes up, I'm feeling goosebumps, that's was so perfect.",Positive
"Good game, love the layout and everything, has Sci Fi Star Ocean & Persona 5 vibes, but they need more content and also more ways of earning premium currency and exploration elements.",Positive
"You hate genshin impact because of the boring repetitive gameplay, paimon, power creep and stupid puzzles you need to swap out your team for? THEN THIS IS THE RIGHT GAME FOR YOU. Gameplay is amazing, writing is pretty funny, random and 4th wall breaking, the gacha might still be there but even units you get for free are strong (like March 7th is an S tier supportive unit). Overall they took genshin and made it 50x better.",Positive
"RNG is bad.. It keeps giving me the same character (Sambo) everytime i warp summon.. And there's no skip button. For me, it should have a skip button and this game feels like its P2W.. If you dont have any money to buy, it is hard for you to pull anyone you like..",Negative
"I love this game! Amazing art and characters design and also the story is pretty good too! (Even tho I'm kinda confuse and need to recap for like 2 times, lol)",Positive
This game is good so far but often it crashes and there is always this login error shown and i have to login many times to restart the game i started playing for two days and this problem persists,Negative
"Pretty good. Would like more puzzles, exploration, and at some point some kinda housing (a room on the train????!!!) but all that usually comes with time in these games. The content has been amping up so I'm pretty happy with that.",Positive
"After 1.1, the overall loading and fps issues became a WHOLE LOT worse. The release version had ZERO problems. I don't know what you did these past patches but every new update, it's expectedly gonna turn out worse.",Negative
I have trouble to log in to the game. the game just stuck on the loading screen train. it's already been 2 day. i like the game a lot. but now it's sucks. please fix this,Negative
This is good however the more you play the more become challenging and difficult. I feel like that there is only one or ten percent chance of getting a five star character,Positive
"Awesome game, badass story and gameplay. It becomes a bit difficult later on, but you can complete the game as a F2P player without any issue.",Positive
"the game often crashes when opening character profiles, and also when trying to restart the battle in the domain. Please fix it as soon as possible, because this problem seriously disrupts the gaming experience",Positive
Good game so far. A turn base game style is fun and unique cause it's not like Honkai impact 3rd and Genshin. Having a new experience is fun. The character's art is beautiful and the story is interesting.,Positive
Honkai star rail is a really good game and its one the first ever games i got addicted to playing on my phone and i dont normally play games on my phone but i have played hsr more than other mobile games if u like turn based games you should play hsr it has its cons i.e its a gacha game and i am not fond of gacha but i still enjoyed it even the gacha side i gave it 4 because it still needs alot of improvement and i hate the trailblaze power time gate it makes it hard to get good gear.,Positive
Amazing game. Great lore and graphics. Gameplay not that difficult only end game content need think a little f2p btw if you're struggling it's skill issue.,Positive
This game is so gorgeous the graphics are perfect the gameplay is perfect the characters are perfect but sometimes my phone is freezing i hope hoyoverse will fix it someday,Positive
"Nice pace for a turn based game. All characters are usable, which means even without gacha u can still clear all content available as long as u build ur character properly.",Positive
"Beautiful graphics, awesome OST, nice story and you really feel the rpg experience like old RPGs. Plenty exploration without being overwhelming.",Positive
"hellooo, so i just re-install this app bcs i just move to another device and when i open the game, it just shows a picture of the train and I wait an hour but nothing happens. so i uninstall and install it again and the result is still the same. what should i do? thankyou.",Negative
I pretty much love the game the first time i try it but several days later when I log or start the game it keeps me out or basically it crashes is there any way to fix it,Positive
"I love this new entry from the makers of honkai impact 3rd and genshin impact! Looks great, controls are very tight, and the effects are topnotch! Would recommend to anyone interested in open world turn-based rpg games!",Positive
The MB size of this game is getong bigger and bigger until your phone can't handle it anymore. Majority of your phone storage was eaten up by the big MB size of this game.,Negative
"I'm currently facing a glitch where I try to load into the game and it just crashes, can't even get past the sign in screen",Negative
"Early game player very very hard game play. Enemy's overload powerful, very bad characters damage. Story very boring lags other. No jump options, no Dodge characters option. Bad game.",Negative
"Too craptastic for a PC game and too ambitions for a mobile game. Maybe if you have a 2k brand new phone, but the UI of the game is horrible on mobile.",Negative
"Honest Review, I really love how you make this game, this is the first game that made me into genre RPG, but I have some issues, to be honest, when I play this game on low setting + 60fps, my phone get overheating really bad, so please fix it",Positive
"Too much story and the story has slow paced, the animation of story is also slow Not even have skip button. I hope you add atleast ""Skip"" button on every story because not everyone is into game that has full of story, some are just like to grind and play right away.",Negative
It is a great game but I can't use some of my characters because they're just white. If I use them on the battlefield the game auto exit. Hoping you guys can fix it ASAP!,Negative
"Although great game and great graphics my only problem was that everytime I try to log in the game it keeps repeating saying ""log in error. Error code:3033""",Positive
"Pretty good! The interactions dialogue details in here are like what I expected in action RPG games. As someone who played Undertale, Omori, Oneshot, and such games, I'm liking it so far. Definitely meet my minimum expectations.",Positive
"The game is good and fun, the graphics and quality of the characters are very very good. But for memory storage it's not very friendly huh üôÇ",Positive
Another F2P friendly game from hoyoverse!!! This time is an RPG!! Niceeee.. graphic is excellent... Old style FF feel... Very enjoy having fun in the game ... Definitely a must to give it a try...,Positive
Genuinely one of the best games i have ever tried. i love the storyline I love the character designs and everything about this game I also like how they are kind of generous with the rewards as well,Positive
"As I will forever love hsr, theres been a problem ever since the update. It kept exiting whenever I initiate a battle, especially in SU and trailblaze missions huhu.",Positive
Having a problem where I can't even get past the title screen. I even have all the settings down to their lowest. Aside from that pretty cool game,Negative
"I can't download the game because it isn't compatible with a BRAND new phone(Xiaomi A3) devs I really, really hope you guys can do something about this...I swear I'll change my review instantly",Negative
This game sucks because it takes too long to download resources. If my screen turns off from it taking too long I have to start the process over again. Haven't even gotten past the start game screen because of this. Total bummer,Negative
"The download times are so long and you can't do anything else while it downloading, forget about your phone for several hours even with wifi",Negative
"The opening takes an extremely long time. It makes me feel like the game has crashed. I have watched Teminator and Terminator II, and still no movement. At least give me a status bar. I'm going to Uninstall and look for another game.",Negative
"Really fun game, good combat, good characters great voice pretty good story... only gripe here is the pull odds. I've pulled 10 around 8 times and I've only got the welcome summon pity character....",Positive
Amazing game I thought it wasn't for me because it's a turn based but after I played it enough to understand basics I fell in love ü•∞,Positive
One of the best games after we lost exo heros,Positive
Got tired of it. Only fun thing is the story. 02/05/2023 Edit: I was an idiot back then. This game is awesome ü§ß,Positive
"Issue with the game currently is that there is no sound despite me having the volume on, I tried using headphones but that doesn't work either so it's disappointing that I cant enjoy the game since there's no sound for me.",Negative
Exceptional turn based game. Graphics are top notch. Gameplay is smooth and it won't cause your phone to overheat just by starting it like Hi3 or GI. 5/5,Positive
Love the game the graphics is amazing. Just one little draw back maybe 2.those r need to make getting the jade and summon tickets easier n more exp items,Positive
"One of the Best Action, Fantasy, Space, Turn Based Combat Game I ever played Graphics 10/10, Gameplay 10/10 overall 10 out of 10",Positive
"My first videogame was space invaders on grandpa's 2600. Can you imagine the trip from there to here. I've only played a couple of hours, and I will be back. Everyone about this game is just lovely, and the tech is applauseworthy.",Positive
"A bit buggy, lag spikes for like few seconds and crashes once in a while Game is still unstable but I'm sure it'll get more polished and refined",Positive
"Great game!!! The devs have great respect for the community and its players. Constant updates with great game modes and end game content as well. Spectacular character designs. Great job, keep it going!!",Positive
The games great good graphics and cuts cutscenes but some bosses like ebon deer are just too hard to beat.My friends keep telling me to target the plants but every time I kill one the deer summons 2.,Negative
"So far i love the game, but my complain is, after 4months play,i realize The Erudition Class is so badüòÇüò≠üôè, Nothing special about it, if Erudition is specialist in AOE damage, I tell you Destruction class is way more better to do AOE, i hope hoyogames gonna fix this, otherwise it is deeply regretted",Negative
Played for 2 months aboard. Tried logging in in a different country and new phone... Just can't and support is sleeping,Negative
"While I love Honkai Impact, this game is not the right direction for continuing the series, it lacks content, has autoplay feature which makes the game repetetive and also is p2w as hell, I will never come back to playing it.",Negative
"Didn't get Robin, so I quit:v. Beutiful game though. Story is awesome, and feels like an actual adventure.",Positive
nice game but I am low and device user,Positive
"Reached trailblazer lvl 60 and I don't know what to do anymore. The story is below average, the game mechanis is below average, only the graphic is good. NOT RECOMMENDED. This game is boring after u clear the 2nd world. The forum is full of simpers that I can't understand their hype for.",Negative
Best game I've ever played. I've never been this addicted to a video game.,Positive
Is it only happening to me when i try to enter my accout it says accout does not excist if so pls fix it,Negative
Very good game. Very f2p friendly as well. The story is really well thought out. The character interactions are amazing. And the resin system is very good,Positive
Star rail is my favourite mobile game so far. Not over grinding. I like the battle mechanics. Good story good character design. And puzzle for this game is one of favourite in this game.,Positive
Always crash when i try to open it the log in screen has too much of animation if i want to open it I'll try more than 5 times just so that there's a chance it can open,Negative
"I LITERALLY LOVE THIS GAME but I ahve a suggestion, its that to allow to delete past story storage, basically delete useless storage from the game, the one's already used cause i think hsr is gonna be like 50 gb soon",Positive
"Love the game has beautiful graphic even on low graphics,love the story mechanic,but crashes a lot please fix it.lt's the only down side when playing mobile.",Positive
The Story telling so far is absolutely beautiful. I also appreciate that you can you any character you want and still being able to complete content. Genshin being my introduction to Hoyoverse I didn't have high hopes for this game but 10/10 would recommend.,Positive
"Opening the character menu is a gamble because a lot of times, the screen goes black, and the audio continues, but the whole phone freezes for a while them the sound comes back.",Negative
I find this game to be very fun with great animations! The story is entertaining and they keep adding more stuff to do which is great!,Positive
updating my review!! since penacony has been released the game became much more exciting and fun the story quest is the best! give me sparkle please ü•∫,Positive
"The gameplay is fine, however the pull rate is the worst I have ever see for 5 stars. And unlike genshin, this game sort of requires more op 5 star units to get more progression in to the story. Just don't olay this game.",Negative
"Saw an ad and downloaded this. Haven't put it down in 2 days. Great battleststem, voice acting, world building, etc. I haven't played an RPG that made me feel this way since the FFX/ Tales Of Symphonia / Baten Kaitos Era. So fun and magical",Positive
"Game is fantastic, lore is fantastic but storytelling and grinding is just horrible. On top of thay, Mihoyo has a ridiculously bad customer service. Just skip unless you wanna waste your time for a bit",Negative
Seriously this game is so addictive so many events quest and exploring to do and the characters are really good the design is so detailed if u paying attention 10/10 also love does stories u can never run out of jades and warps so much to do eh,Positive
It's been fun you probably want to casually buy the battlepasses and maybe a monthly every now and then for your enjoyment but I find that you are still able to enjoy fully free to play.,Positive
"i love this game its super cool and cool i enjoyed playing this until galactic roamer update came it has now become much laggy and some of the buildings and cities are transparent its like, its missing some pieces please fix this.",Negative
"I love this game, but please reduce the damn lag (it made my phone go 1FPS most of the time). Plus, the game has been crashing all the time lately. My device is Samsung Galaxy A03s.",Positive
"The first game with purely turn based combat I've enjoyed. The story is interesting, the characters are cute and funny, and you can fall in love with a trash can",Positive
Edit: game no longer crashes for me so my 5 star rating is back,Positive
"As a Seven Knights player back in 2016, this game brings back good memory with turn-based style. I love it! Please don't listen to haters, developers did a great job",Positive
"Very impressed with the graphics, good character and a interesting story. Can't wait to see what updates are in the pipeline.",Positive
"Wish that you could transport data betweed diferent regions and you could friend people from diferent regions, i chose the wrong regon and when i tried to wsich over so i could friend someone i lost everything. Also after like a few weeks you finish the entire game if you play for like 5 hours a day.",Negative
"Great game. But the thing is my luck in pull character is very¬≥ bad idk why. I just try pull like almost 200 hundred but still no 5* character on the recent banner. Very¬≤ disappointed. I hope, I have the will too play this game in the future.... maybe I will just quit...? Idk",Negative
"Love it. Definitely addictive and fun to play. Love the turn based rpg. Graphics are great, voice acting is amazing. Keep up the great work Hoyoverse",Positive
"I will give this a 5 star because the gameplay,the graphics is so amazing but also i have a problem about the 100+128MS PING so i wish this problem fix quickly the game is amazing more like genshin+final fantacy üíôüíôüíô keep it up",Positive
The final boss in the simulated universe World 7 is very annoying. It's hard to beat even if you beat subordinates who can produce fruit! Does not make sense,Negative
"Theres a bug when i switch the graphics mode, it gonna lag and when i restarted it, it will stuck in loading mode i hope you fix it i'm disapointed.",Negative
Really fun game but takes up a lot of room,Positive
"if ur characters are strong enough everythg is actually rlly easy so stop saying ""I can pass this or that"" it's just bc ur builds aren't good enough",Positive
"Let's get some 2 star. I thought about giving it a wingstart. You're the ones though, but it takes way too much space on your phone storage space and it takes forever to get it started. I highly not recommended",Negative
The game stared as a good game but I deleted HSR after seeing the animation they uploaded officially dance of acheron & black swan. Why you guys did that sus animation Eww I don't like to play that kind of games You guys are RUINING THE MIND OF UPCOMING GENERATION TEENAGRS & KIDS,Negative
Doesn't let me skip the story and animations I'm not playing to read through your stupid and boring story so add the skip function,Negative
"Best turn-based RPG I've played, awesome story, fantastic animations and harmonious OSTs.",Positive
"This is a stunning game, first time playing it and it has made a great first impression. Spectacular visuals, characters and gameplay.",Positive
Give us new players a chance to get Dr. Ratio for free by doing a quest or summon a specific number of times in special pass like the free 5 star after 300 normal pass summons for new players. I keep hearing about how generous HSR is more than Genshin but its basically the same.,Negative
"Absolutely amazing but please be more respectful with your characters and not show too much , keep up the good work",Positive
"Things that need to change ASAP: the relic system. When a big portion of your character progression is behind a giant RNG wall, you know something is really bad.",Negative
"This game is good but every time I login back with my main account , I lost the progress from my main account, could you please fix this issue sooner",Negative
Amazing game. Story is twisted and I like it. I wanted to play the game and see if it was possible to get seele as a f2p and it is. If you grind and stay comited you can win too,Positive
"PLEASE add this to PS4, I know it's on PlayStation 5, but I'm sure it would be even easier to lend me and my poor bros a hand üòî",Positive
"I can't play it, it's so laggy, won't even get passed the login screen. Genshin is still fine on my phone, so is Honkai Impact, it's just this game that's not working. I've deleted and reinstalled it, made it even worse. refreshed and cleared up space? no. It only works in my gaming phone, other phones? no.",Negative
Game forces you to spend money. You reach a limit in leveling up characters so you can't level up until you complete a specific mission which you can't complete until you level up. Also too much meaningless dialog.,Negative
"Good game but currently experiencing severe lag. Even though I'm using fast 5G wifi/mobile data. Always experiencing red and orange ping. Please fix this issue, thank you.",Positive
"A bit boring.. It much better if the gameplay FIGHTS such as Genshin,free to kill enemies... storyline,character, design such a perfect..",Negative
"Awesomeness to the max. Has a old school style, with new school graphics. Top notch animation, it doesn't get much better than this.",Positive
"Lovely game, cinematics are incredible, gameplay is enticing, Characters are amazing, Overall a incredible game... but WHY FIREFLY!!!",Positive
"This game is so good, not a big fan of turn based RPGs a but this one is surprisingly entertaining, the characters are likable and the plot is interesting, definitely recommended!",Positive
"Hoyoverse put their whole booty cheeks into this game. It's incredible, the characters are fantastic and fun to level up, and the story is magnificent. Truly recommend this game to anyone.",Positive
The tactical part is pretty good but most content of the game is the storry and its pretty tiring when you downloaded a game for the battle and collection it wouldve been fine if there is a skip button else youre just playing tap titans galore,Negative
This game is good but i want to log in with my apple id in my android phone but i cant,Negative
"So love this game, many beautiful and gorgeous character. When we tired for activity, this game so helpful to finish daily missions ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è",Positive
"The thing is , my device got stuck on loading screen about fricking 10 hour. I open the game then sleep but its still at loading page!!!",Negative
When's the next map?! This game is great for rpg players!,Positive
"Seemed like a fun concept, but the combat is awful. Each character has a basic attack, one skill, and an ultimate. Damage is almost none if you don't hit an enemies weakness. Very disappointing game",Negative
Needs to optimize the cutscenes in low end device but still is good for my phone even my device is low end device but you can adjust the setting and graphic to low so can you can play honkai star rail without crashes your gameplay,Positive
"Fun story with great sense of humor, easy grind, lots of free stuff. Basically the opposite of G*nshin.",Positive
"Honestly, I'm an avid fan of Trails series games which brought me to this game. Aside from diverse characters, skill showcase and the fields are great!",Positive
"This game is hella good. Im tired of seeing people complain about the game not starting. LIKE GET A NEW PHONE ITS NOT THAT BAD or just dont trynna play it. Genshin, Honkai Impact3 and this game takes a lot of storage too so maybe thats the problem. And if ur phone is like 10+ years old dont even wonder why the game doesnt work. It WORKS.",Positive
Great game so good the characters are so good to play with and so good lookin yk I love playing this game so much can't wait for the next update. I recommend this to friend but I probably won't because I don't have friends üòò‚ù§,Positive
It keeps reseting my progress and I have to re-install 7gb of my data again! It's only if I don't get a day streak or smth. I don't have time for that.,Negative
"Semi-open world experience! I'm trying to enjoy and finish the game good as I can, the game is quite similar with Punishing Gray by KURO, and of course miHoYo game is much more better actually. I take this opportunity before soon too will have new open-world game will release by KURO. miHoYo and KURO always have a wonderful game to play, and very recommended. ü´∞üèº",Positive
Overall game is awesome but i didn't like the fighting system it should be open like genshin i hope they will change it turn based system making the game boring and auto battle. Playing in auto battle i would rather watch a YouTube gameplay no difference,Negative
"I love Honkai Star Rail, I love the ultimate animation, battle too, and not only the splash art character more details they also have good scenery and music and also I love the story and the mystery on some character that we need to search about theirs past etc and the connection on each character",Positive
I don't know what to do. I forgot my password and solve the puzzle to play.Tho it says there's an error but when I do it a again it still the same. I might change the rating if this is fixed thank you!,Negative
"As of now the game is excellent mechanics or gameplay are Easy to understand, song is awesome and the story and lore as always top notch and as for the graphic its wonderful.",Positive
"I love the game though for some reason it keeps crashing, don't know if it's cause of the last update or something but I can't even play without the game crashing 1 minute later",Positive
"The game awesome but I laggy, have audio glitches and bugs. It is not optimized and I can't play on competition mode its laggy and in normal mode it stucks on loading screen. Some while playing my phone get restarted. So please fix it.",Negative
The Game Gacha system is not Good especially for Free to play Player for just Small amount of Stellar jade you need to quest for 30 mins + long quest. 50/50 is not like that its Like 30/70 because every time not guaranteed automatic you will lose it and Get the Curse hero Gepard Now my Gepard is E5 . Everyday dailies you can just get 60-70 stellar jade everyday and you need to get 1600 jade just for 10 pulls and always Hard pity of 86-90 pull so You need to waste a lot of time farming and lose,Negative
I've tried to play this game several times however it never goes past the title screen and comes up connection not available I would love to give a proper review if I can ever get the game to load.,Negative
Edit: game connects fine now however after no gameplay issues during the launch patch now the background and frame rate is so bad the game is practically unplayable since the 1.1 update,Negative
"My problem is with the server. Every time I open the account and start playing, the connection is cut off, and the problem is not in the internet. I do not know what the problem is. It is possible that the server has a problem that causes the daily interruption of the game. I do not enjoy playing because of this. I hope you fix the problem.",Negative
"I hope they add some jump feature that's the only downside of the game for me but overall this game is very recommended the graphics, the fighting style very satisfying üëç",Positive
For now i love this game. The graphic is awesome (except lagging when certain special parts happened in the game) but overall i recommended for playing leisurely.,Positive
"Decent gameplay otherwise ruined by the excessive cut scenes and dialogue. If you play for 2 hours, I can guarantee you an hour will be spent on cutscenes. It's like watching the world's most boring movie",Negative
Nice keep it up more event to earn stellar jade diamonds. Plot and worlds to save with amazing story line keep updating the game and we will be playing for years. And make the account security more solid to avoid being hack. Ty,Positive
"This would be a 5 star if the devs would push updates through the Google play store so it would auto update when I'm not playing, I have too little time to play and when I do I open the game I'm slapped with a several gigabyte update that takes an hour to download.",Negative
"Good game, but 1 major setback for HSR and Genshin is the absence of a dialogue skip button. For an open world game with thousands of dialogues and a tedious grind this is absolute torture and borderline deathwish for casual players.",Negative
"I love this game, but the ridiculous amount of forced dialog is really pushing me away from the game. No, Bronya, I don't wanna sit here and listen to you talk for 5 hours to fight 2 enemies and talk to seele for another 10 hours. Like, please, shut the hell up!",Negative
"I abosulutly love the game,but the probability of getting special characters is so low,the only reason I kept playing this game was Kafka,then preceded to never get her to drop,don't think im going to play much anymore until she comes back.",Positive
"I wasnt able to play it myself, because it lagged a lot (which tends to mean it has really good graphics in my case) but what from I've HEARD it seems really good. I definitely will try and download on another device when I get the chance",Positive
The game is good but I will give you full star when you fix the bugs. The screen get stuck sometimes when we teleport.,Positive
"Downloaded this game to earn points needed through another app. Did NOT even get to try it out since it requires email registration to login and play. TMI, goodbye, uninstalling! There's plenty of other games out here for me to play and get points I need without all that.",Negative
"Ridiculously fun. I've never had an issue of the game crashing or any bugs, and I've been playing since launch religiously.",Positive
"I LOVEEE THE GAME<33 MANY THANKS TO YOUR GENEROUS GIVING OF Stellar jades its really convenient to f2p users. The only things that frustrates me is the amount of GB it needs for the new update its literally burning my phone but who cares i loveee the new update. The plot twists, tingyun, the new lore, danheng's IL design lovee ittt.",Positive
"A good experience overall. Good story, good gameplay, good graphics optimisation. A big plus that I can play this on PC as well.",Positive
"Great Game, Simple yet Exiting Game, to Balace Work and Playing this Game at the same time. However, World Quest, The Vibe, Even the Quest and The World itself does not meet my Expectations as with the other game, Genshin Impact.",Positive
"Great game and a good combat system.Greate animation,graphic and character.And those 1 star rating guysÔºåit's your own device problem.It got nothing to do with the game",Positive
"After the last update. The game consumes too much data. in 1 hour, it consumed 1gb of my data. Previously, it will only consume no more than 50mb of my data in 1 Hour. Hope you guys will fix it and I will give 5 stars again",Negative
"Bug in the beginning: turning off the phone and opening the game again makes the way to the next mission section unavailable, softlock. Mission : Chaos in the deep",Negative
"It's 2023 and these guys give us a fixed position left joystick ü§£ Seriously: movement is frustrating and ruining the game. Even if the joystick were improved, needing 2 hands to play a turn based game on mobile is a dumb decision. Even tap to move would be better than this.",Negative
"Crashes so badly that ""System UI has stopped working"" when not in compatibility mode. A lot of stuttering in compatibility mode.",Negative
Fixed many of Genshins issues but retains the big problem with artifacts. Beautiful animations and voice lines as always.,Positive
This would be great for PlayStation 5. Pom-Pom favorite character. I like all the characters and the game grahic are very cool. When this goes to PlayStation 5 will I be able to transfer my game from my phone just asking.,Positive
"When it loaded it suddenly froze during the space ship cutscene, I tried multiple times on trying to get it to work but I seemed like there was no fixing, so I restarted it but still nothing",Negative
"It's a rly fun game, though it doesn't have co-op (multi-player) yet. That's okay, since the game is still in it's early phase. The only problem is that the game takes so much GB. I love the game ;D",Positive
Don't know if game is good or not...it's stuck on loading screen. Will not do anything else. Looks like a train traveling through space though on loading screen. üòÇ,Negative
"It's a very good game but sometimes it crashes when I'm in a middle of a fight, I have good internet and a new phone but it keeps crashing, please fix it.",Positive
"Hi. Can you fix the issue when trying to log in our account there's always an error, the it takes me couple if tries before i can enter the game. üôÑ",Positive
There should be an improvement with item drops of calyx or boss drops. It takes like a week to fully level up the character abilities.,Positive
"I absolutely love this game. When I'm playing a game I look for good character designs, great mechanics and graphics. IT HAS IT ALL ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•",Positive
"Amazing game no doubt about it. But the audio in cutscenes is very distorted and it hurts the ears, i hope it can be fixed",Positive
OMG this game is so good... I just love it's musical experience it is so good. The only problem is that whenever I log in there is somewhat kind of error. The error code is:1001_3 please fix this.,Positive
"I didn't play the game. It says 110 mb of data, but the 7008 mb of extra data is equivalent to 7Gb of data. Genshin impact takes up a lot of Gb of storage, so I know I won't have enough for both. Good luck to this game though",Negative
After the update come i can't play the game for 2days no for some reason of error code pop in the screen and some Miss texture of the game... I would change my rate if they fix it...,Negative
"I lagg in real time combat so turn based is perfect for me, and about the graphics, audio, dialogue, music all are the best.",Positive
"I've been playing this game since it's launch, I haven't had any problems yet. I find the game play fun, and even though the main story is probably pretty short for me. It's a true gem to laugh at since it's has such a well written story like always.",Positive
Love this game. It is the best mobile game I have played. It is just like the turn based rpgs you can play on a PS4. Also the graphics are awesome.,Positive
"The story line is so good, quest, riddles etc, but too bad for me i can't use high resolution, cuz if i do, it'll be so laggy :( But best game so far ^^",Positive
"A fantastic experience, great gameplay, story, characters, designs, music, side quests, everything has been an absolute blast",Positive
The animations the environment and music far surpass my expectations even as a person who doesn't like turn based games I still recommend and love the game.,Positive
"It's been blast playing this game. Overall i am very satisfied. But one thing, is lack of story and content. I hope there's more content and side quests.",Positive
"It would be fun if they weren't talking so much, I just want to play the game but they blabla all the time and there is no skip to it. At least bless us with a ""skip conversation"". I've lost too much time reading nonsense and the actual gameplay of mine is like 5 minutes. Cmon. Less yapping please? Ok edited to one star because there is even more cutscenses with unskippable, useless talking. If I wanted to watch an anime I would!",Negative
"Every time I try to login i can't, displaying error 1001_2. I've reseted the game multiple times, uninstalled and reinstalled and so far it does not let me login.",Negative
"I love this game but fix hoyolab. I check in Every day and have push notifications enabled. Somehow, however, I still keep ""missing days"" and it drives me insane. How do I fix this?",Negative
"Just one complaint Why your game optimization seem more poor with every new update? When at launch it's runs smoothly, and now always lag and occasionally got fps dropped so bad Even though i can running other heavy games just fine Definitely your server side problem, not my device nor connection for sure",Negative
"This game has good graphics. However, I have to say that it's just not my style . In turn, fighting is my main reason for not liking the game. The game has been acting up for many new players, which is something that should have been fixed before release.",Negative
"Glad to have great RPG turn-based game again. HSR has great gameplay, stories, graphics, animations, and voice actor & actress.",Positive
Better than genshin impact and and a much better fanbase too (thank God)! It's clear that the devs care about the game and listen to player feedback! Very fun and runs well on most devices! It deserved the game of the year title that it got!,Positive
Its a great game the combat system the stories everything. One thing i would change tho is that you could skip the burst cutscenes,Positive
"Since updating, now the game won't even play. It keeps crashing constantly. I have a pretty new phone that has no problems so Idk why it keeps crashing so much.",Negative
The game is extremely slow to load up pas the first initial start of opening the game. I've been trying to play the game for the last three hours please fix or I'm just gonna give one star instead as well as uninstall the app.,Negative
The game is amazing through and through but ever since this new update I'm not able to use my trailblazer character everytime he pulls his ultimate it glitches out and I'm not able to use him please fix every other characters ultimate works except his.,Positive
"It's been a while since I found a great game that makes me come back every single day. I am enjoying this one more than Genshin to be honest. Less stressful, more chill, more enjoyable and less burnout. Great work Mihoyo!",Positive
"Just a solid game (gacha) that allows you to not feel so taxed when playing, since some of the gameplay can be done on auto. Seems to be much more generous than its predecessor Genshin.",Positive
"I love this game and think it's really good, but I feel like it's kinda unplayable on mobile. The game takes up so much storage to the point where it's the only app I can have. It's like you don't even care about compressing the game",Negative
"The Game is laggy for a high spec device, but its used to be fine without lagging. This is because they remove 45fps setting on the game. Please kindly add that settings again. My phone is really hot on that fps",Negative
After the new update I logged back in and seem to lost all my progress and now I'm pissed was excited to play again but now I guess not since it wiped my progress and is making me restart from the beginning.,Negative
"It was so laggy when I login, I have deleted some of my apps to lessen my storage and lag but it still lag but its great to play, just I cannot play normally since I always see the map like glitch out.",Negative
"My screen will become black after i finish grinding some material,idk why,my storage and ram is doing just fine.This happens too frequently and its annoys the hell out of me,fix it.",Negative
"Honestly very good game as it is high end graphic level with smooth frames. I am AR55 in genshin so I wanna have break to play this game. Now I am addicted and can't go back. Kinda worth it but this game is nothing compared to genshin Impact . Love this game , 5/5 ü•∞",Positive
"I like the game,the graphics are really good,but i dont really like the long story. It takes a really long time. Sometimes i forget that im playing a game not watching anime.",Negative
"I started playing this morning and I've been playing all day üò≠ this game is literally so incredible and extremely well made. I love the RPG turn base style with the free roam, gacha and story I can't suggest this game enough üíô",Positive
"This game is good. Story is also fine but I would want this game to be open world Fighting game. Turn base RPG is not so fun. On the otherside,genshine impact boss fight is amazing. And also not many events come. So this game is becoming boring. Make some events please.",Positive
"Game is alright, but the in game shop is the apex of greedy. They somehow made the gatcha system worse than Genshin Impact. Just to put things in perspective, spending 20 USD (Including first purchase bonus) gets you one 1 pull. That's it.",Negative
For a free gacha game. It's doing everything right! I haven't spent a dime on the game and am enjoying the crude outta of it! Characters are beautiful. Areas are beautiful. The turn based gamely feels nice üòÅ,Positive
"I play genshin alotüòè and I'm glad this isn't like genshin. It is amazing that it is a different style of gameplay (turnbased combat) it isn't an open world game, it mostly falls under the honkai impact style, also similar to honkai impact it's like open area sort off.",Positive
"Don't be turned away by turn-based play. This game is extremely fun and a welcome change from Genshin Impact. It can be played at a casual level quite easily, and is guaranteed to bring you hours of entertainment even if you don't put any money into it.",Positive
"So, all that time from launch, and all we get is 5 minutes worth of story, two small areas, and a bunch of filler sidequests? What are you spending the millions you make on? Certainly not putting it back into the game, that's for sure.",Negative
"The game mechanics are interesting but the dialogue is boring, dull, condescending, and wrong. Totally off-putting, and the dialogue shows up slowly so it's just a waste of time.",Negative
"Good graphics and that's it. It's the type of game that you would play for atleast 2 weeks then qfter that you will delete the game then you'd go back to your regular main games. It's just like Genshin impact, boring.",Negative
"Amazing! I love turn-based rpgs but this takes the cake. I love the way the combat is and the gameplay, the characters are also cool.",Positive
"Finally after waiting for so long, i fell so inciting for the game,and i hope the stage and the item to build the character are not so hard so i can clear it without need to waste so many time in real life, still thank you for the hard work of making this fascinating game and hope all people who read this has a good day.",Positive
"Sensational experience with rich in lore and story. Vibrant cast of characters with top tier voice over and voice actor both English, Japanese and more. Recurring character from past installments from Hoyoverse and open-world exploration.",Positive
"The game is good graphics, good story, and good character but since the update my game has gone like weird my loading screen train is invisible while in game my maps and some character are mess up so please fix it hoyoverse I wanna play the game",Negative
"So far so good, the game is very generous hope it stays that way in the future, but the only thing that is bad was the cutscene, every cutscene is lagging even the sound. Hope it get fixed...",Negative
Very fun and intresting. Started with low expectations but a single day.. No less than an hour was enough for me to know that this is the kind of game that i would enjoy. Keep up the good work hoyoüëç,Positive
"Update THIS GAME IS AWESOME!! Everything is beautiful! The music, the audio, the gameplay!! It's almost perfect! FIRST ENGLISH REVIEW!! Man I've been waiting for this day. At church so I can't play yet and I really hope it lives up to the hype and anticipation! I'll update my review when I get some time in.",Positive
"It's funny, but... very sad if only could have the option to take the Stelleron, away from the Silvermain guardian, I'd do it to save her and any others, but sadly, I could not save her...üòî",Positive
"I rate this 4 star because I can't log in the game, it's always the ""Login error, Please Try again later, Error Code 1001_3 I don't why, it's keep popping and I can't access the game, I've try all the possible solutions but none of them worked........ SO PLEASE FIX THAT",Positive
"Not a single honkai beast in sight. However, it's a very lovely rpg with tons of humor. Friendly to both whales and casuals as we're used from hoyoverse. Welt and himeko are playable and absolute units for now. Please hoyo more trash bin lore that s**t is amazing!",Positive
"For some reason when I play this game with sound (even lowest volume), my Dog has anxiety/panic attacks. I don't know whether she's picking something up I can't hear but it's really weird.",Negative
"Thank you for giving me low pity Seele and her light cone, 5/5 for this. I also really like the character design so much. The dialog has a joke sometimes, which makes it less boring when reading. Also, the references used in this game",Positive
No option to skip the dialogues or any other scenes. I mean come on some of us might have enough time but I am not going to sit and watch the whole scenes and dialogues for ours. Atleast make it skippable.,Negative
"So many dialogs without skip button. I mean adding a skip button has nothing to do with those who are interested in the storirs, so why not just add it for more players",Negative
"I was waiting eagerly for the game But idk why it says Login error.Please try again Later. Error code 1001_3 Hoyoverse do something I'm stuck at the loading screen can't even login, love the game and aesthetics but the login problem is just a nah for me Please reply if u see this !!!!!!!!!!!!! It's on phone not on PC",Negative
Very good game addicted to it lol and could you add controller support for android man ios has it but android don't have it like man it is so relaxing when playing it with a controller pls add it as soon as posible even genshin does not have controller supp pls add it for more comfortable experience for controller based players,Positive
"So far, much better than I anticipated. Played through the bag beginning chapter and I gotta say, the work put into this has already made it a killer app to have on any device. This won't be leaving my phone anytime soon",Positive
"This game is really addicting, I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT! The story and art style is amazing. Hoping for new updates in the future.",Positive
"Honkai Star Rail is HoYoverse's most confident showing yet. While its gameplay doesn't really do anything new, it excels at the fundamentals. When matched with a memorable cast and enthralling story beats, it cements itself as one of the stronger releases of 2023 so far.",Positive
Really nice game . I'm enjoying the story and the gameplay . It becomes boring sometimes but really nice time killer tbh . This game isn't p2w and I like it . Try it if you have time to waste .,Positive
It's very smooth and paced. I mean when eSports players are getting DQd because they were playing another game...it's great. Haven't really felt the pressure of the pay wall.,Positive
"When its release, i too hype of this game and really excited to play it but theres a big problem that i did not understand, why is this become an error, i mean when i start this game, it says ""login error"". How is possible that the game is error. My phone has a 6gb ram and 120gb storage. Please fix it.",Negative
Great game but 300 summons and I only got light cones. Can you raise the rate of heroes or give a hero pitty abit earlier than 300 summons. Since I spent so much and feel let down for it. Other than that it's a great and fun game,Positive
I cannot for the life of me download version 1.1 like the game is incomplete and won't open if I download it from the Play store but if I download it from app market it STILL won't load because the one in app market is not the updated version and yeah thats my problem,Negative
Best game I ever played. Mihoyo never fails to impress me with their games like Honkai Impact 3rd. This is a super action-packed anime style game with super cool story timeline you should never miss. A must-play game.,Positive
"There's a bug when using characters at early game, when i touched the ult, i cant continue because there's no button to continue the ult, i play on phone so i don't know if other mobile users have same problem with me :v, well i hope the bug will quickly be fixed",Negative
"Do not listen to the 1 star review,they either is the most inpatient person or has the most potato phone in the world because they don't understand,this is 10x better than genshin impact,you should try it out when there is time,the voice line and story is also better than genshin.",Positive
An Amazing Game! The story is very good. The character design is amazing. Awesome writing. Enjoying every second of the gameplay.,Positive
"I give 1 star on this game not because the game is bad, it awesome but the real reason I gave 1 star is the storage required for the update. It make me feel that it game is for gaming laptop only not on smartphone. If every patch is around 6.5 gb the mobile player can't play it anymore even though they stroage memory is 128 or 256 gb.",Negative
I really love this game so much! Bc this game is different than other hoyoverse's games. Also this is the first turn based combat game I've ever played. Really enjoy it! Can't wait for Kafka!,Positive
"Love the game because its actually way easier for mobile users to play this game other than genshin, sure in genshin you can move freely to fight which is cool, but most mobile users have a potato phone so this game is perfect, not too much movement(for short, its less buggier)",Positive
"I can tell it's gonna be good y'all, and with the ppl complaining about the long loading screen, just re open the app, that's what I did lmao. Anyways good quality,graphics,soundtrack and just everything is good!",Positive
"Turn Based, no Open World, Enemies look like Toys for 5 year old, No Skip Button, The Story is Whatever like I can't even call this a game. It's just a very poor imitation of One. If can't improve Genshin at least don't give us Junk to Play.",Negative
"(Redited) okay, it really is the best game app out right now! Best story, anime, character development. And the story goes on and on to new adventures.üí™",Positive
Old school final fantasy vibe with genshin characters! Very fun RPG with an excellent story and very fun characters. All in all if you're a fan of old school jrpg then this is the game for you!,Positive
"*I'm not Honkai Fans first time ply n review. 7GB memory and many updates nid more more space for phone. high quality Feel like final fantasy RPG game. Have to spend a lot of time to play this game....... auto play only for normal enemy, if boss u must have strategy control u self to win..",Negative
"My honkai star rail gets buggy after the update, some textures were missing and there are a lot of holes in the map,, the whole map starts blinking in and out and even the train of the beginning start game",Negative
"I'm loving the game, not fan of turn based rpg but this game made me loved the genre.there are some bugs that when playing I hope that it can fix as soon as possible.",Positive
There is an imbalance in damage output between the emenies and party. The party seems to barely leave any scrthcesh on the enemy while the enemies distribute higher damage and can easily KO your party. Even at high level the party barely do any damages and stikk feel lime they are distributing damage at level 1-5.,Negative
"The fact it's taken me nearly an hour and VERIFICATIONS EVERY TIME I CLICK A BUTTON. Just for it to update and then freeze totally...Naw fam, this is giving me huge ""we'll force you through sh!7 storylines that make you drop our game, vibes",Negative
"Im not a fan of turn based gameplay. But guess what? This game taught me to be not judgemental. Amazing characters, stories, graphics and all. I love this game üòç",Positive
"Interesting games (based on the announcement and all) but I can't login using my phone. My friends also have the same issue. I really wanna play this game, so, please fix.",Positive
"Ohhh yeah! Looking Forward! This is gonna be an old school experience Turn base Strategy Game. I feel sorry for those who gave a low ratings to this game who said it's just same old stuff gacha BLA BLA. There are many games like this but when I saw this in beta , I feel like I'm playing in my gameboy and psp 30 years ago, and RPG with RTS but this time a much more sophisticated.",Positive
Not a review but a question. Why does Honkai:Star Rail consume a lot of mobile data? I only played for 2 hours but it already took 1gb data and will this issue be permanent? I have played both Honkai Impact and Genshin Impact but they don't consume a lot. Might limit my playtime depending on the reason,Positive
This game is so good I'm getting addicted to it just playing about a week but the only problem is the lag on the cutscene literally it ruin the beatiful song on the cutscene especially in asia server but when i switch to America the lag literally just gone don't know why but asia is so laggy,Positive
"So far I love it the characters look awesome, I wish you could do a little bit of climbing, I like in the story were they say your should go rest you actually go to a room to sleep in the story:)",Positive
"The game is great, The graphic is also very beautiful. It haves alot of contents also.So far, I'm enjoying the game very much although my luck is kinda not on my side. But still very enjoyable.",Positive
"This game is hamstrung by the awful randomness in the character pulling system. Can't recommend this at all. Rolled 220 warps and all I ended up with is an E1 Clara, if there is a way for bad luck to screw me over it will. Everyone else is pulling multiple characters by that point.",Negative
"This game is really fun , the characters are pretty tier as well in terms of VA and design. If you are a veteran gacha player you will realize they broke down the units into element and classes thus improving longevity of units. Really having fun so far and yes I got Jing Yuan",Positive
‚òÖ1 do you know why? just bcause the story cant skip!!! so boring watch the girls talk too much!!! waste my time!!! i dont fckg care about the story!!! i just want to play the game not watching anime!!! make it to able for skip story!!!,Negative
"The controls are quite difficult for mobile, like when exploring the open world, but still so much fun!",Positive
"exceptional graphics and characters, I was blown away of how detailed they were. I would highly recommend this game to anyone whos played pokemon and genshin in the past. 5 stars!!",Positive
"Very interesting storyline, overwhelming graphics and cinematic scenes. I'm excited as I play and I've seen familiar characters from the game I played before (hi3) so I'm expecting a lot for another honkai lore.",Positive
"Turn based game that has element but didn't give free stuff will never work. Very hard game. Anyway, this is pure genshin. Rate same, model ui same, run animation same, all quest model same, based char also same, worst one->CANT SKIP dialogue. Just borrow lore honkai. Also, Elysian-like feature is very confusing. Pay for this game is wasted, better on genshin because can control char. Whaler,be smart. free pull 20? You got that from quest, also 80 pull. Not giveaway from celebration. Fake news",Negative
"The game doesnt even start. It stuck in the loading screen after I pressed start game button. There is no loading indicator either. The space train animation is still moving, but there is no loading progress whatsoever",Positive
"It is a wonderful game but it's not like an open world game like genshin impact but its a similar type of game and i do recommend it but for only high&device player but on the other half low&device player it is not for you and I do agree to that... ""Thank you for reading my review... goodbye and have fun guys""",Positive
I love this game and gameplay also give me persona vibe after playing genshin imoact for 2 years and i got bored I wanted to play another mmo game with anime style I try it and love it. it is perfect like graphic music voice acting (jp) everything is very great,Positive
"Had downloaded the game but everytime I try to login, it keep saying login error. Even after I change to my another email it keep saying login error. Pls reply.",Negative
"Great game, runs very well on release. Amazing dialog, detailed tutorial and interesting gameplay with lots of options.",Positive
"I cant remaping/change the button controller for PC, i have big hand so its hard to push WSAD, so when playing GI and HI3 i change the WSAD to another button like AEFD, hope in the future HSR can change the WSAD button too",Negative
"Great story and graphics, like genshin impact this games offers a gacha mechanism, so if you don't want to spend money, you have to work twice as hard to get anything on the game.",Positive
"The main reason to play hoyoverse game because it can be played on android,PC and playstation not many game can be played in cross platform,I really love playing anime style game with japanese voice.i can't wait for honkai star rail in-game event in the future update.üòÅüòÅ",Positive
"It's not even working. I'm signed in and registered. Ice tried reopening the app. I tried re-downloading the app. But every time I press start game, it tells me log in error",Negative
I really appreciate how you do this game with so much hard work..but can I say something..it doesn't work to me..I cannot login into this game because of some error while my internet was still okay..I will really appreciate if you can fix it..thank you..,Positive
Absolutely love the game so far! It's definitely been a better f2p and beginning experience than many other games I have played! Plus it's a turn based rpg?! Count me in! Gotta roll em all!,Positive
definitely good for players who likes close combat fights then this is for you it has awsome animations just like genshin and it kinda looks like genshin but in a sci-fi style.,Positive
"Starlight event sucks. If you accidentally choose the wrong rewards, don't bother messaging customer support, they'll just tell you too bad and to deal with it. Missed out on a free 4 star cone bc of this. Ill change my rating to 5 stars when they decide to change their ways and not be trolls to f2p.",Negative
"I think it's really good but I wish we could jump, climb, get different voice lines when attack and different attack movements",Positive
Went to play the game for the first time and waited for a few minutes and nothing happened. I closed the app and opened it and I was finally able to start. Well it started downloading 7gigs and I said no way.,Negative
"Great story with some funny easter eggs and dialog along the way. Easy to understand and play, no need to p2p as they give you a lot of strong characters for free along with many free pulls for others.",Positive
"I been playing Genshin Impact over two years and I have not been interested in any other games from Hoyoverse, I decided to try Honkia Star Rail. Wow I was amazed that I liked it, is different from Genshin, but also fun. Now I'm playing both.",Positive
"So far this game is BETTER than genshin impact. Especially the humor. This game is funny asf and so unserious even at times where it should be serious. The storyline, character design, gameplay and very nice I would say.",Positive
"Been more than a month since playing. I've also played Honkai Impact 3rd for 4 years and Genshin Impact for almost 3 years. Have to say there are plenty QoL changes implemented here by taking from both the previous games. The characters, story, and music are god tier as expected from miHoYo.",Positive
This game is one of my favorites! It's similar To Genshin impact which is also one of my favorite games! But there is unique differences between them! I can't wait To Explore more!,Positive
"I can only enter the game after getting an 'error' 3 times. And when hsr getting update, I waited half an hour to enter the game. Very bad experience.",Negative
"I love the tutorial, and the art and animation are amazing. I barely started playing, but i already love it.",Positive
Tried this one due to the hype and uninstalled 1hr later. Basically spent 50mins for unskippable story scenes and 10mins for boring combat. Must be in top 10 of worst games that I ever played.,Negative
"Waited 4 days, played it and it's the sam as any other hoyoverse game. Like I'm genuinely sick of it sorry. The characters, animation and graphics are wonderful, but that's it.",Negative
"One of the best games I have ever played, Just from the graphics alone is worthy of praise, The ost's of the game resonates with you through it's melody and uhh , It's good okay just try and play it.",Positive
"Best game released in a long while. Been addicted for days! Unlike most games these days this one has a soul and a lot of passion and love put into it, Can't wait to see what the future holds for Star Rail!",Positive
It's not great but not terrible. It took a couple restarts to actually start the game. Much better on the PC and more optimal.,Negative
"Drop rates are 1%.. good luck, otherwise. Story is great, again after few days once ya finish it, no point to log in. Can't get old characters, fun for week or two but eh",Negative
Fun game with stylish gameplay and a great story. This game has become one of my favorite gacha games. Just hope the dev makes when MC change path so does the relics and ligth cone. Also please add jump button.,Positive
I did not play it yet but I feel like this is one of those pokemon games turn to turn but human I'll play this for my own boredom edited: this game has the same pity system as genshin but it's more fun because of the animation and cool and cute characters and I got the limited character in 9 days of playing,Positive
Meh. Why did you have to make this a turn based game. for that reason alone I can't get into it. I hate the whole standing there getting hit idea instead of using actual skill. I see a few other people are deleting this game for that very reason as well. Sorry. Loved genshin and honkai impact the 3rd but not this one. Everything else is great.,Negative
I deleted the app then re-downloaded it to give it another try and all of my progress is gone and I pulled Seele. I don't understand why the game is starting me over when I use the same Google account for all my games. Very discouraged to play now.,Negative
NEED I SAY MORE? BEST TURN-BASED GAME. Genshin players rating this game with less than 3 stars are just losers who can't play turn-based games and games with ni jumping button. THIS. GAME. IS. PERFECT.,Positive
"Overall, I love this game so much but only one make me asking ""where the chatting feature?"" I mean the chatting feature for friends, i think this feature is so common in every games online, so I hope development of this game adding the chatting feature for friends:)",Positive
"Currently waiting for it to download. Definitely worth it tho. Graphics look amazing, and so do the characters. I'm coming from the GI community so I'm very exited!!",Positive
"As an adult who had no time to play but weekends, this game is grind-friendly. Has a good storyline and great graphics. I lost 50-50 twice and I'm still playing. LMAO",Positive
"Bruh, I always get 4 stars and cards (I forgot what it was called), why would I rate it 5 stars when you always give 4 star and cards!! I alrdy spent manyy¬≤ Stellar jade and I still not get any 5 star!(I have one btw! But only one!!üò≠üò≠) I'm only level 44 btwüò≠üò≠ have mercy!!!üò≠",Negative
"Battle is imbalanced, by a LOT. You took so much ""inspiration"" from Cold Steel yet you keep the frozen abuse while they nerf it lmao, also breaking almost give no advantage even if you timed turns and weakness when fighting boss. And i might be lucky for getting a healer and shielder but i wonder how ppl do the main quest where 5 mobs are hitting 1/3 your hp each while accessing items is pretty limited. forcing for gacha spending? reroll account? And yeah with only 3 moveset it becomes boring.",Negative
"I love it, it's very good.. But i need help on the floors and walls.. They aren't appearing all i can see is like stars and stuff but i can still play. But ayways it's a good game and it's nice.",Positive
I don't know what to do anymore no mission to be play anymore.farming too become repetitive as I don't want to waste my fuel everyday i can only do 3x farming that eat up 60 of energy.thats all i can do after that energy is down i just log out it's merely a minute.well i hope there's new update soon,Negative
"game is well done, but the monetization kills it.. seriously, you need tonspend the luck of your life time (or thousands of dollar) to max your character.. it has all the problem of genshin. I can understand if you need to get lucky once for your gacha character.. but this game demands 7 of that with no option to work for it",Negative
Sooooo Booorrriiiinnnnnggggggg..... no skip cut scene and have to take a lonnggggggggggggg dialogue that so slooowwwwwwwwwwww conversation. I have to keep pressing the screen for half an hour without any playing the game just running around. How could you think this is a good idea for player to keep on waiting. You will lose so many new players because of the first 2 hours is so slow. Hope this will have other way to fix this problem. Fighting time is like 10 to 15 minutes for 40-50 minutes play,Negative
It doesn't work for me. I've waited an whole hour for the game to start. Unstalled it twice and deleted stuff for it and it doesn't work. Dumb,Negative
I started this game because its a hoyoverse game and having played genshin i had high expectation for the game. Sadly the only thing goinf for it is the story and nothing else. Turn based is boring with no innovation to already available turnbased gachas in the market. Not to mention they used the same Gacha rates and pity system as genshin where Reactions and Openworld made having the characters more impactful. and knowing hoyoverse there will be no endgame in this to so it will get boring.,Negative
"One of my favorite, kinda sad because i had to quit this game, and I'm very missing it whenever i saw this game on ads or on the others social media. Much memories, good time.",Positive
Best moble game I have found the open world and the graphics for it being a mobile game is just amazing I don't really rate games bust this game and the others that this company makes are the out most amazing games u could ever play on a mobile phone or tablet like for real for real,Positive
"Absolutely incredible, from graphics, to story, to Easter eggs, this game is everything I wanted and more, Mihoyo has outdone themselves yet again and I can't wait to see what they have in store next!!!",Positive
This game is so goofy I love it so much. It doesn't take itself seriously but the lore is still really well written. Also can't forget to mention the MC romanticizing the trashcans and dumpsters,Positive
I downloaded this app 3 times today but it just made my phone heat up and wont let me pass the log in screen. It says error code 1001_2 and took all my excitement into frustration. I don't think I'd want to see this game for now because it infuriates me,Negative
"I absolutely love this game so far, the fighting is nice even tho I like Genshin impact fights with free movement, this is another fun way of fighting, pluse the story and characters are good to, I'm happy it came out today üòÄ",Positive
"Turn base gacha, but no story skiping, no ult animation skip, messy feature interface. I played staight 7hour trying to find some fun to play but the more I play, the more boring the game gets.",Negative
"It's amazing, but not as great as Honkai Impact 3rd. Also considering how it just recently came out, this game does have a lot of bugs and annoying yet hilarious glitches.",Positive
I love the game... Please hoyoverse there's a issue in server I am playing from India and aisa server had issue at forst i was in game i completed quest but I logged in after few minutes then I am getting error of connection and then I played genshin there was no issue please fix network issue in server..,Positive
"Great game, but even on medium graphics, the game is burning up my device (Samsung Ultra 22.) Can't risk my cell melting. This game should really be on consoles like PS5 & Xbox.",Positive
"The game is absolutely amazing on PC, but I can't seem to get it to work on mobile. Keep getting error code 1001_3, despite my internet being very good. Sucks, because I want to experience Star Rail's glory from the comfort of my bed, too!",Positive
Just like when genshin first launched you will run out of main story after a couple hours. Its still a gotcha at it's core so be responsible with your time and money. I like the turn based strategy much more than genshin and I hope they keep working on the game.,Positive
The game is cool iv bin playing genshin alot then isaw dis game but theres alot of things that need fixing example error code 100_03 and the game not working hope it gets fix i realy wana play the game for what iv seen in youtube hope you guys fix it . Have a nice day,Positive
Its 2 glitchy to even play It keeps sticking and nothing happens and once u restart and uninstall it does the same thing over and over I really wanted to play this game but the bugs are way 2 much,Negative
"Its mind blowing that in 2023 theres still a new mobile game that have no skip cutscenes button, i can understand if the game have decent story, but genshin and this? Theres no originality garbage generic mediocre story, definitely 1/10 obnoxious game, please respect your players and stop wasting their time",Negative
this game is very good but the sad thing is the relic farm. you waited for 8-10 hrs for a 2 runs in relic farming. the 40 energy per run hurts a lot hope they do something about the energy consumption.,Negative
"Phenomenal. Great gameplay, storyline and art like Genshin, but with autoplay that makes it easier for the working peeps.",Positive
"Hoyo, ya'll need the game to be fixed for android users ASAP! I use a Samsung A12 and I can't get past the main loading screen and there is always an error message then the game would restart.",Negative
"I was starting to lose interest üòí in genshin impact üòî due to because of lack of story and plot twist but when I heard that üò≥ honkai star rail is out ,I felt like üëç finally something fresh but it's not some as genshin which it's a good thing I don't no why people complain and comparing g it with Genshin but me I think something new and fresh it's nice plus when I look at it I am looking at genshin and honkai impact combination",Positive
Everything good but often time the game will suddenly reboot my phone and also entering combat mode will take too much time even tho i have excellent internet with me. Please fix this and you will get that five star,Positive
I only use mobile data and it always take 20 mins to enter the game. it says error 100_1. Can't your game support those whose intwrnet connections are unstable? I'll change it to 5 star after you fixed it.,Negative
"I can't log in and it always says failed to log in andy wifi works great but it won't let me in, I've been wanting to play this game ever since it was announced so if you can please fix it ‚òπÔ∏è",Negative
"Gatcha rate so awfull, gameplay to dragging and repetitive, tutorial cannot skip, for the first n second time the skill animation i can tolerate but for the entire battle, man its Painful",Negative
"Brilliant game I love the characters they are all very adorable, and hot! The game itself I would say is a a lot better then genshin in action and quest. I like this game more than genshin impact if I am being honest",Positive
I would love to give this game a five star.....if I can actually get into it. It won't load it just stays on the home screen and never loads so I can play the game. Does anyone have any advice to help?,Negative
"It's alright, but why do I need an internet connection to play a single player game, at this point I might just revert to playing the old stuff where the system requirements is a growing potato, ruined my day with literal boredom until I got home",Negative
I love every single minute of this game since I also loved how the game portrays some good game style from honkai impact which is my favorite Hoyoverse game that I played. Now with Star Rail it gonna be even more fun. Thank you!,Positive
I got disconnected during a battle due to a tunnel. The game decided to force me to replay it AND it refused to let me auto battle. What a waste of my time. Disrespect.,Negative
"The game is good but it is not very optimized, I downloaded it but on my cell phone it gave me a horrible fps drop and that my cell phone runs The genshin impact at a stable 30fps I don't know why this game has that optimization if the genshin has more weight",Negative
"I'm getting error 1001_2 the entire day, meaning there is a bad connection between me and the server, I'm on the European one. However i will wait for it to be fixed eventually, because i am genuinely curious about this game.",Negative
"I love the game so much, but the fps and lag is killing me, my processor is supposed to handle this kind of game since its not yet a full game, so i shouldn't experience fps problems, pls fix, i cant play the game properly üò≠",Positive
I still can't login using Samsung A12. I'm playing it on PC but I also wanna play it on my mobile device. I hope it'll be fixed on the next update or maybe make it available on Samsung store because Genshin from samsung store is smoother compare to playstore version,Negative
Can't even play. EVERY SINGLE TIME I try I get a log in error after I tap the screen to start playing. I was really looking forward to playing this too.,Negative
"Bruh, they didn't add a skip function for the dialogues. Way too boring reading all the time. The tutorial also took forever. Just let me play the game instead of going through long processes. I came to play the game, not to read a book and watch a movie.",Negative
I was expecting star rail to be more like honkai 3rd since i hate genshin for the sole purpose of relic farming. I know this is to create diversity and options for players to actually focus on their fav character but seriously why though? Stat spread is gonna be really varied and pumping out cash is not what im gonna do since this game is still on alpha release imo. Please give the relics one room each so at least players can get wrecked in that specific relic of their choice,Negative
"I have never played a turn based game before but I love it, I also like the familiarity that is has being similar to genshin impact. I love exploring this new world and story!",Positive
I really like the game but now after the update i can't even play and the train doesn't even render and alot of mobile players are getting the error code 1001_3 please can we get a proper solution for this problem.,Negative
"Changing the rate to 3 stars. Why? Because I have to log in the game for 4 times because it kept telling me error occurred. Overall, the game is good.",Negative
"The game is similar to another from the same company which is totally fine, but really disappointed at battle, I thought it's going to be just like gensing impact. And there is not much to explore also. It's not a open world game. Game is total 8gb and it took me 4 hours to download.",Negative
lots of fun. love the characters and writing. the combat is turn-based which might not be for everyone but i really like it.,Positive
"Since honkai Star Rail is in a alternate universe the way they pronounce the names in english will be different than in regular honkai. The game is mainly single player and the less characters u have the more you will have to level up certain charactera for the story. Early game the gameplay is fine, but once you are 30+ in mobile it can take a long time to load or destroy your phone loading in the process. You can play honkai and genshin just fine, but ztar rail built different.",Negative
"It's a very good game, kinda a mix of all my fav games and I like the game play, thought i would like it if you can jump in the game but still a 4/5 (please hoyo add the jumping, please)",Positive
I kept on getting the Error Code: 1001_2 when logging in. I was so hype to finally be able to play but then this error popped up. It crushed my hope like she does when I saw her holding hands with a chad that would never be me :'),Negative
It's free entertainment if you avoid spending. It's new and visually nice but the story is not very engaging which may or may not be the same for others.,Negative
inc. easy to manage and amazing designs!! issues star rail passes well for beginners and i love turn based games so a little biased,Positive
"Great looking game with great character designs and animations. Though I really enjoyed playing this game for about 3 solid weeks I quickly realized that this game is not for F2P players like myself. I'm currently playing other gotcha games like Cookie Run Kingdom and Street Fighter Duel. Where as these games give F2P players allot of resources to spend on rolling for new characters, Star Rail seems to be very cheap with its currency.",Negative
"Its a great game, love the characters. Though its harder to get characters via draw because of the cones. Perhaps a separate draw section for those?",Positive
"Solved my own issue. If you can't log in, youregonna have to unfortunately uninstall the game and redownload it in order to login. Game is fantastic and am glad I was able to play",Positive
"I've been disconnected for several times during match. And each time I reboot the game, it always start from beginning. Is it kind of your ""Great"" work?",Negative
I hate this game the other place's had missing part and the game crashed!! When it's start to load the game. I waste my money to buy oneiric shard now I can't open honkai: star rail genshin impact don't crash even though it had more gb than this,Negative
"Perfect game. character desing, story, pretty much everything is perfect this game also pretty much a friendly game for a low end device, totally should try",Positive
I really love this game! But why does it always lag when theirs a cut scene? Even though my storage is okay. Though i hope it will get fixed.,Positive
"Really enjoy it. Good character design, voice and story. The battle is nice. The theme are perfect as expected of Hoyoverse.",Positive
Been looking forward to this game since it was announced. I love the turn based combat and the animation quality is top tier as expected from Hoyoverse.,Positive
"F this game I guess, they allow one 50 draw for a decent champ, thing is their is soo many attributes, thus massive range for counters. If you don't have a counter, you might as well forget it. I paid $75 you would think that would get you through the campaign, $50 went to maybe 4 10x draws zero legendaries. You can't really earn the draws without levelin you main profile, you can't level your profile without progression, you cannot progress without Champs. The worst part is, they lvl cap .",Negative
"This game is a really Story-Driven, Turn-based combat game. With Gacha just like Genshin Impact. If you like Turn-Based Combat. This game is for you and also, Hoyoverse has some of their Best Story telling in this game with amazing Side quests, funny Jokes, & Silly Easter eggs that make every little corner of this world worth exploring.",Positive
Great graphics. But I was surprised how consuming battery of the game does. So it is a big no from me for the game for this inconvenience.,Negative
"Ok...I've been waiting to play Honkai Star Rail since the official release of the game, but when I was about to start into the game I got the following error message ""1001_2"". I've looked everywhere for an explanation and I still don't know what it means or what to do about it.",Positive
"Super fun, Mihoyo literally never misses these days. Feels a lot more generous than genshin so you shouldn't have any problem working towards doing more pulls. The only downside is how long the characters talk in each questüò≠",Positive
It's a good game but damn thing keeps crashing can't play for more than 3 4 minutes before it crashes other than gameplay is awesome.,Positive
I've been waiting for this game for a long time but when I play it it feels really boring no action. This game seems like galge game where there are always very long conversations and you can't skip it,Negative
"So far, it's been really fun and addicting. First game to play in the hoyoverse franchise. The story has been good so far. No issues or bugs on my end.",Positive
"So uhh just a report for the game, the 2x button has a bug that whenever you return it to 1x, it becomes more slower than ever like the speed is around 0.75x which is off, if you can please fix it guys hehe thanks",Positive
Great game but please fix the animations/videos in the cutscenses make it smooth for all devices like GI so that the game would be much appreciated to play for everyone.,Positive
"I love the experience, I never thought that I'm gonna liked turn based game but since this game released. This is the only turn based that I liked the most. Keep it up joy üòä",Positive
"Amazing game, smooth high end graphics, great music and exceptional voice acting. Devs did a great job.",Positive
This game isn't Genshin but the characters are so pretty and the game is enjoyable. I also want to say that the customer service is amazing I reported a bug and they were so kind about it.,Positive
"The anolog stick to move your character is in one place, it should be free roam on that part of the screen. There is no controller support and no look inversion making it tricky to see where I'm going. The gacha system is terrible, 0.8% for a 5*, the start 50pull guarantees you a 5* character within 50 pulls so if you pull a 5* on your first pull thats the guarentee 5* gone. There is no beginner pack that normally guarentee you a 5* character. Only a pass? Why?. No skip button very lame.",Negative
"Its a good game and it's pretty fun but its the lag. There's cutscenes lag, the distorted sound and lagging while fighting the enemies",Negative
Seriously getting fed-up on the constant error messages. I can't even play this on the go!. On my pc and laptop it runs fine but on android this game cant even get past login.,Negative
"Freaking fantastic. Great design, great writing, great soundtrack. Been waiting for this game for ages and it's everything I wanted and more.",Positive
"PPL NEED TO LEARN TO REVIEW RESPONSABLY. Just because you don't like turn base games doesn't mean give it a 1. The ratings are for quality not your personal tastes. I Don't really like turn based either but this blows RAID out of the water. The design is flawless and it has actual cut scenes not just static characters and written story. NOT every game they do is gonna be Genshin their building variety and lag on day 1, oh poor babies experience dial up and no free games then u can complain.",Positive
"Im changing my review. The game is good at first with a good story as a single player rpg in 3d, however, it quickly becomes a pay to win mess. Gacha has no pity system with terrible rates, several units have been nerfed causing me to lose battles I used to win. I initially gave it 5 stars for the story and rpg turn based battles and exploration. Now, until they change the nerf system and dirty gacha practices only 2 stars.",Negative
"Alright, this is a great game and all, I feel like it's easier for most people to play turn-based games than action RPGs like genshin, and I think it's been pretty great so far, can't wait to see what's up next",Positive
"You can actually have fun for free! Genuinely good game that just happens to have pay features, but the game throws tons of currency at you, so free play is still rewarding",Positive
"Pretty good game, but Star Rail's gacha system is just as horrendous as Genshin. Would only play if you are just in it for the story and dont care about what character you get to play the game with.",Negative
Spectacular. Its fun! I like the story quest and the gameplay is mobile friendly! I love all the memes joke inside the game haha. And its somewhat runs smoother than genshin and doesnt take alot of storage,Positive
"Awesome! Wonderful graphics, storyline, and voice acting! Beautiful designs and mechanics. I love this game! Would absolutely recommend to Genshin Impact fans!",Positive
i can't play this game it keeps crashing i can't even open the game for 1 minute it just keeps crashing and kicking me out of the game when i check my internet it was running smoothly please fix this immediately,Negative
"I downloaded this game because I saw a you can pull 80 ad but when I was done only received 20. No wonder the rating is terrible, false advertising doesn't get far. I rather stick to games who keep to their words and ad uninstall.",Negative
"Im rank 36 currently, great game. Issue is It keeps crashing and doesn't let me log on. My phone can handle Genshin and Honkai Impact fine(which take way more storage), but not Star Rail for some reason.",Negative
"My long lost love classic turn-base RPG is back, Great design character, Great Story, Great overall system. A bit of Salty never mind me from all above!!!",Positive
The game is great and I have had a blast playing it so far. It is the first space RPG game that I have played so for the first impression the game is great with a good story line and side quests,Positive
"To be fair the game is fun, but the reward is not really rewarding. No daily login reward sometimes, so many material needed but so little energy to farm them.",Negative
I love this game as much as genshin the whole interaction itself is cute hahaha i need touching some grass smh. One star is specially for understanding building characters so i put it out sorry i srsly dont know how to build them and always end up dying :) well life is all abt luck too,Positive
I have no complain about the game because the game was just too amazing.But the problem here is that i can't login in the game.It keep saying that Login error occured.That error was 1001_3.I'm Hoping that you will fix this!!!,Negative
*(Stop giving 1 stars because your phone can't run the game I've had literally not one issue yet 60fps max resolution ) Already addicted to it if your a genshin player it's definitely similar in game functions and the game ui wishing system etc.,Positive
"Trailblazer level 32 right now, all f2p very fair and balanced so far. Fun mechanics and story plus improves on a ton of things genshin needed like better starter characters, quicker dailies, and even giving a free standard 5 star character off the starter banner. If you liked genshin I bet you would like this one too.",Positive
This game keeps crashing please fix this problem hoyoverse. Btw the combat system is soo good i cant wait to pull new characters.this game was a 5 star rating but it crashes soo much,Positive
"Incredible TRPG, the graphism are stunning and the whole game is fluid, right the day of the release The interactions are funny and wholesome too, it's legit a very good game ‚ù§",Positive
"Love the game, but... I keep needing to reboot the game it's been two days already, Hoyo, and I still can't get into the game. PLEASE FIX THIS!!",Negative
"I can't even get in the game it keeps saying, ""Downloading resources failed.Try again.""So then I press it then it keeps showing this pop up screen again and again so please fix that so I can play and also change the two stars",Negative
"Actually this game was pretty good I am giving this one star because of the redeem code expiry date is in just one day actually it was a really horrible experience because I was so busy because of work and I couldn't login in the game and for just that reason I deleted this game for that reason,good work developers the code doesn't even valid for 5 days",Negative
"A very wonderful game, but the fighting method is a bit annoying, but it is very wonderful, the animation is very beautiful, It became my new favorite game after Genshin Impact :)",Positive
"I love it, gameplay is fun and smooth (I'm using a gaming phone lmao) and the story and characters are interesting! I also play honkai impact and I love seeing Himeko/bronya/welt and some of the others here too! Great game üòá",Positive
"Game is terrible. The backbone of this game is a Gachapon system. You can't reliably get the characters you want or need. If anything, Google should be fining Mihoyo to the tune of a few Billion dollars until Mihoyo stops using Gachapon systems.",Negative
"As a player who started Genshin Impact in August 2022 and started Honkai Star Rail on its release and had pre-registered for it,I am super impressed and happy with this game! Its Refferances to many differant games/other things are hilarious and despite being used to genshins gameplay, i cant help but fall in love with how this game's style plays is too. Pom-Pom is adorable and i love how mutch you can interact with it.The fighting style,story and everything in this game is perfect,great job<33",Positive
"Turn based genshin. Basically. I love the graphics and animation. I have no complains with the gameplay. But the gacha part? Well, its copy paste from genshin. 90 draws for pity. What next?, 50/50 to get 5 star? I would spend $$ on higan eruthyll rather than this sorry. Already quitted on genshin, looks like ill do the same on this",Negative
"Well, i played for an hour but when i left the game and opened in a few hours ago, i couldn't log back in. It said login error occurred. I've tried anything to fix it but i can't",Negative
"One of the best RPG game. I love the graphics, characters and many things to discover. I will recommend RPG fans and many gamers to try this gameü§ç",Positive
"Very good design i like the story, finally this open a new door for turn based RPG on mobile. I also play the PC client.",Positive
I seriously love any turn-based game that's why I'm enjoying playing this new hoyoverse game so much! üòçüëçüèª it's worth to download it as long as your device have enough storage for future updates.,Positive
"It's really great! as all hoyo games are, but I only have one request and that is to add a chat feature with friends? since I added my friend there but we can't chat in-game",Positive
"This is genshin impact in space and I'm here for it but it does not have multiplayer or pvp, the only thing you do is add your friend's support character that's it. Tbh real deal breaker for me.",Positive
I give it a 5 star because I like this game it's graphics and content but after a long time playing this game it can not give me the right fps and it has some data problem I am saying because I am playing this game at my 144fps 16 gb i7 1650ti laptop at 7.5 MB speed and after thate some time the game don't give me a response,Positive
When I first found out I was so excited and now that I played it I wanted to play it 24/7.the problem is I don't have a laptop/PC and my phone likes to over heat. 10/10 best hand warmer.,Positive
"Started it when it released. I enjoy it so far. Nice characters, good game play and the story is interesting. No compliants.",Positive
First it's not a bad game but it's to heavy pay to winI do not mind spending some money but not over $200 for one character. For the first week I enjoyed the game but I will have to uninstall due to pay to win.,Negative
Brand new experience for me when it comes to mobile RPGs that pack so much into them I become skeptical but in all honesty this game lives up to what was promoted! I definitely look forward to how far this game will grow,Positive
"I have a pixel 6, I get about one frame every two seconds. It took longer to get to the login screen than it took to uninstall this.",Negative
"Absolutely been loving the game, even if it is a massive cash grab. I don't plan on spending any money on this game and been enjoying it pretty heavily without so far.",Positive
"Sorry i have to give 1 star. First of all, the game is good, and i like this kind style of game. I can give a 5 star. But since the gacha are very difficult and also if you dont have a 5 star char, you are forced to Pay to Win. Sorry if i am F2P but some player dont have capable afford to pay. I hope the developer can make more easy gacha to have 5 star char.",Negative
"The overall game design, story building characters are good But the login issue which is happening currently is frustrating like Login Error 602,Global Distribution Error , I request the dev's to fix it ASAP please",Negative
"It was a great game, a great storyline and very interesting characters! But I do hope soon we can play with our friends in the same world and chats with them.",Positive
"brand new s23 ultra and I'm genuinely worried it's about to melt. cutting edge phone and it is breaking down trying to run this game. like dude. you know what phones can handle. if my phone is hot enough to burn me, what is this game doing to an older phone?",Negative
"Everything so Mediocre so far the animations are average, 1st event is boring and depressing, and 1 month in the game there's nothing to do except farming for 10mins then exit.",Negative
I have no idea but for me I think either games to heavy since I can't play a normal cutscene without it disturbing the sounds in so meny spikes it's anoying to your ears can skip it neither so yea what happens is it the galaxy a51 or the game ?,Negative
Waste of fxxking time. Forcing players to read and listen to your longwinded uninteresting stories that you assumed it is interesting to player. It is boring af. Excessive amount of unnecessary time wasting context and chatting.,Negative
I love this game i just dont really like it being turn-based.. and the characters are so hard to get too! I would do a 10 pull and i would only get artifact ripoffs...,Negative
"Dear Devs, I loved the game graphics but the fighting mechanism is boring compare to Genshin Impact, because in genshin both player and enemies we fight together and not waiting for each other. I would rate 5stars if the same fighting mechanism applied same as Genshin style",Negative
"If you plan to play this game on multiple platforms, DO NOT use the log in with Gmail option. The process for transferring your progress is so complicated and convuluted Its embarassing.",Negative
"I really want this type game, adventure, tactics, Action, Fantastic Story and Best Animation style game. I really enjoyed this game and thank you for making best game.",Positive
"What a massive disappointment, I thought the game play would be like The open world style genshin, turns out it just some idle game. Me and my friends installed this thought it would be like genshin so that we can play with each other.",Negative
"I love this game and the play style. I saw ads of it and wasn't sure at first, but the feeling I get when I get awesome combo attacks is amazing. 5 stars all the way. Keep up the good work",Positive
"Addictive, fun to explore, easy to play on any devices, amazing characters designs, great graphics, just perfection",Positive
"Great game and visuals -- also much more open world than I was initially expecting, which I love! Characters and story are also well written... Overall would recommend üëç",Positive
This game is awesome and the graphics are also good but I think that there must a little optimisation for low end devices . Thanks for creating a beautiful game üòÅ,Positive
Just one word for it.......Awesome! This game packs everything you need; from immersive action fights(turn based RPG like) and intresting and exiting storyline....damn this is really very one of few gem I have,Positive
"Incredible story writing and interactions, interesting battles an lore, and puzzles that are not too complex, as well as great QOL features. 10/10",Positive
The mechanics of the game and the graphics is truly a masterpiece but there is a lot of bugs that is needed to be fixed pls fix it,Negative
So farrr..it the best game I've ever played.. the design style it soo beautiful I love ittüíïüíïjust hope for the new character to be announced quickly.. I was waiting for the red hair guyyü§≠ü§≠üî•‚ú®Ô∏è,Positive
The game by itself is good. Mc has depth. Dialogue is funny sometimes. But the advertisements are a terrible representation of the game,Positive
"Unfortunate, really, for me and my Vivo Y30... I can't exactly play it, I can't enter, it lags on the loading screen and crashed. I guess it is not meant on my potats phoneüòÇüò≠",Negative
"It's your typical mhy product, pretty visual no substance, shallow gameplay, forces you to pay attention to the gacha with abysmal rate, because characters only have 2 unique ability you have to obtain a 5 star or their constellation if you want more fun, hated the silent protagonist in genshin same thing here.",Negative
I love everything about this game! The character designs are absolutely gorgeous and the turn based combat playstyle is very very fun! ‚ù§,Positive
"So far my phone is compatible with the game, but it lags and the designs are sometimes lagging due to my phone maybe. But overall, i love the game. Pulling for jing yuan",Positive
"Definitely a pretty good game. Got three 5 stars without paying a single cent, so it's been very generous so far, unlike Genshin Impact. Looking forward to seeing how good pulls continue to be.",Positive
The game was great. But sometimes I cannot log in when I'm enter and it's so lag and crashing even my network is really high... Please dev fix this...,Negative
Hella long unskipable scence like just add a skip button to everything. Took very long to get past the guide part because of all the diologue said by the character.,Negative
"A superb anime between the most dull, run-of-the-mill gameplay. This is worth checking out for only the story but I won't be spending money on it.",Negative
Im having a hard time dealing with fps drop in the loading screen although my game runs on 30fps max its still fun but i do hope they optimize the loading screen for low end phones so that people can still play this game without worrying about future updates.,Negative
"Fabulous ma man.... Keep it up....I really like the design of background, skilla animation and hero design.... The Mc is so powerfull... It make me speechless for a sec...",Positive
"Everything cannot skip like Genshin Honkai, takes alot time to play one story, if you have alot time to play games then yes for u, but this one no for me... üòî BTW graphic wise u can refer back to Honkai, sound effect can refer to Genshin lol...",Negative
Ok so five minutes into playing I already broke it by getting stuck behind a box üò≠üò≠ I don't like how the fighting style is a turn base game play but other then that from what I've seen the game looks great,Negative
"Game is good, but the banners are really brutal. Putting a lot of money into this game for 1 character really makes you start to dislike it.",Negative
"can't jump, the fighting system is a bit laggy and disorganized, but overall VERY good game with amazing storyline and characters",Positive
Wasted lots of internet quota just to see errors everywhere from installation to launch. I get to download few other games after this one got uninstalled. Excellent work.,Negative
"Overall good graphics,no bugs and a good quality gameplay.I just have 1 problem that i always encountered,i always get stuck everytime in the train loading screen pompom everytime i login pls fix this asap‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
"Really fun game, good upgrade from how Genshin handles things. Similar but not too similar as to feel copy and pasted. And in this I actually feel invested with the story.",Positive
"Great, can't describe how good this game is definitely a 5 star rating from me but there are a bunch of glitches with cut scenes overall great game!!",Positive
"Taking my time reading every bit, talking to everyone, opening trash cans. I love a good immersive turn based rpg and this is a great one so far!",Positive
Game is great but it's MS is ridiculously high even with a stable wifi don't have any ping problems with any other mobile game on my S23 Ultra except for this one also it overheats like crazy devs need to fix this.,Negative
"I waitrd for this game for so long and its finally out to play! I love the voices, designs, and gameplay so much. Keep being an awsome game!!",Positive
"I will give it a 5 star but it's just about gacha games that as all the good characters behind a pay wall Also the battle mechanic if just bad ... Like it's slow It feels like I'm just playing Yu-Gi-Oh with the ""I end my turn"" situation.",Negative
its still buggy after using a characters ult i just get stuck of them doing an idle animation it says on the botom enemies turn and the enemy is not even doing anything im just stuck there i repeated the game about 3 times already still the same result...,Negative
The actual f2p game üíÄ But this game is actually mobile friendly and doesn't take much space! And also I can actual not spend money on a gacha game... but I do wish they would add multi-player (co-op) . I really wanna play with my friends.But I am so far enjoying this game.,Positive
"It's an excellent with alot of Easter eggs from all the other games or should I say worlds,? Anyways aside that beautiful game with all aspects including my most favorite the efforts in the expressiveness (idk if that is a word) Good job team :)",Positive
"As a long time genshin player, I had been patiently waiting for this game to be launched and now it is finally here. I'm in love with the graphics and characters of the characters, just hoping the storyline won't make me cry like a baby like I did in HI3",Positive
I play most mobile stuff on a TV or with a controller and this game looks amazing. No controller support. I dislike touch controls üòí Fix it please.,Negative
Thought it still needs imporvement and doesnt really reach my game style Its a great game non the less Additional info I keep getting glitched screens every time i press a conversation or a cut scene Please fix this,Negative
It was a really good game with graphic and voiceline like genshin but if you made it a little open like after the main quest we can going to a open world experience.,Positive
4 stars since the audio during cut scenes are messed up and isn't fully optimized to some devices.,Positive
"the most overrated and boring game ever. traditional RPG with only 1 basic attack , 1 skill and 1 ultimate = idle RPG(90% of auto attack in every battle). and no equipment to grind. and traditional RPG with 0,800 gacha rate = hell, you only depend on pity to get your favorite characters. what a garbage.",Negative
"no way in hell this gae got a 4.5, when I load into the game I takes 2-3 minutes just to load in plus walls and floors are missing, even the train on the homepage, hopefully this can be fixed (or else I'm not installing the game again)",Negative
"The craft system was bad, instead of picking main stat of an artifact I would suggest if we can use the fragment to switch any of the subs.",Negative
"Enjoying this game so far! But there are few things which I don't like, 1. There's no ""JUMP"" button,JUST WHYYY! 2. Characters don't have multiple voicelines for their skill/ultimate",Positive
Worst case scenario I got the wrong light cone from the event banner! Lost the chance for getting it now since it's ending. You like making us suffer just like genshin nothing changes. I quit,Negative
"Took over 30 min just to download for very boring game. You have to follow a lengthy storyline while winning preset ""fights"" battles that you can't skip. Super glitchy, don't waste your time.",Negative
"Kind of a nice game but why did it take me to the beginning when i open it again? I swear i was already far but it just restarts the progress, i dont know if i just change something or if it was a bug",Negative
"I can't continue with the storyline where I am at, can someone pls help. I can't go anywhere and despite resetting positions, i cant reach the lift. i am stuck in Connecting rooms.",Negative
Great game! Everyone complaining about more story than content didn't even unlock daily missions yet lol. The more you progress the more interactive it becomes just have patience.,Positive
"One of the best game i played on mobile devices. Stunning graphics, Great Character portraits, Insanely great dialogues, Waifus gotta collect them all, Addictive yet manageable game.",Positive
"I have a problem that occurs when trying to enter the game, the game sends a connection error or when I got into downloading the files it stops at 33.3 then cache error not letting me download the rest",Negative
This game is much better than Genshin Impact as in the battle affects and skills contents. It's easy to equip the skills for the characters. Good job guys.,Positive
"Arguably the flag bearer for the next gen of turn based gacha. If you liked E7, you'll probably like this. Story is great, directing good, music stunning. No pvp at the moment.",Positive
"I love this game so much but PLEASE make this game a hit smaller. It takes up 29 gigs of space on my phone. I never thought I would actually hit my storage limit, but I did.",Positive
"Beautiful game! Thankyou for this, exactly the type of game I love! Real turn based, beautiful graphics and amazing story.",Positive
"IT'S FINALLY OUT!! I just love the Story and tge characters design, There are some bugs I found.. But overall AWESOME!!!",Positive
I can't even play the game! the game just keeps crashing when it got to the cutscene. And I can't skip the cutscene it just keeps sending me back to the cutscene,Negative
"Dont listen to the one star, i use realme gt master edition, the game run smoothly with no lag or whatsoever, progress is nice and simple no need to rush trailblazer level because you dont need to rush it.. and you can borrow your friend character for clearing material dungeon",Positive
Awesome game so far! My only issue is after a 5 hr binge on it I closed it for a little while now it won't launch again... it keeps insta-crashing. Fix and it's an easy 5 stars,Positive
"Fantastic, crunchy, easy to jump in and play but deeper than the average mobile RPG. Hoyoverse does it again.",Positive
"Wouldn't recommend getting Positives: good graphics, good story and nice art Negatives Battle isn't free like genshin, small world, , can't jump wich really annoys me. This is my opinion though",Negative
"Fun game,even more fun mechanics its just that im not quite satisfied with how the game always crashes to a black screen and how playing this game in 10 minutes and my phone overheats even in lowest graphic settings",Negative
I love this game sm usually I just play in my free time and it is super nice that I can do other stuff while farming for minerals for my character and I absolutely love the character designs I also love the dialogue in the game it's super funny,Positive
"This is a nice game, like really, i love the game fighting style the characters the environment detail and effects and many! This is great!",Positive
"It did'nt work the application, it tooks me several time to open to finish the data download, and then, i never been played the game due to slow running the application..",Negative
"Boring and repetitive. Its like genshin but not openworld. Reward system, storyline, build system all the same. They just used a different word.",Negative
"Not exactly the ""dive right in"" I was hoping it to begin with, the login error was really annoying and I barely could even log in to the game, not even once",Negative
great game but sometimes it keeps giving me log in errors and doesn't let me play(only in the asia server) unlike all the other hoyoverse games in which i dont really get this issue. please fix this üôè,Negative
"Game work perfectly for 2weeks..but recently after the New event update, it's stuck in black screen when you finish some fight sometimes in any area.",Negative
"Love this game, happy to play it and it's very relaxing to me, but even though I put every single graphic setting to lowest the animated scenes keep on bugging and lagging",Positive
The game is So good but when the cutscenes are playing it crashes you need to tap the screen multiple times just to look good when cutscenes playing #PleaseFixIt #Bug,Positive
"Amazing game! The graphics are great,character designs are great.story is great.rewards are already way more generous than genshin impact's.i love the game overall!üòá",Positive
"Honkai: Star Rail is absolutely one of the best Hoyoverse games I have ever played. Even though it had a turn based battling system, it's way better than Genshin.",Positive
Please fix the log in issue it's annoying!!! It's unplayable my internet is doing fine but it keeps disconnecting it's been a week and never been fix.,Negative
"Concerned to discover this app I have never knowingly come across, had somehow installed itself on my phone. I am the only one with access. Star review is because they insits i leave one. I have never played this game",Negative
"1 star the app isn't working and won't load. Anytine I ENTER I get an update which I have already downloaded, then is stuck to an empty screen which will not do anything.",Negative
"Better game than genshin, if we aren't comparing gameplay directly. It's much more convenient to play on the go. Love the rogue like mode. Very enjoyable so far.",Positive
"Its just not very much fun. I enjoy engagement with a game, this is run from point A to B 15x, listen to 20mins of i could give fok story, auto battle for 2 mins. Wow. 2 stars.",Negative
"I love this game but please devs can you optimize the game that i can play smoother using my potato phone,my phone have helio processor but my gameplay its always lagging so ill rate only 3 stars in future ill rate 5 star if you done optimize the game to make the other potato phone user much enjoy the game with no problems at all",Negative
"I have had a great time, gacha luck aside, playing this game so far. Turn based is great and the break system keeps me from using the same copy paste team everywhere.",Positive
Login error. Can't access the game. What a waste of time and space on my phone. So after making us wait for days to play the game you still screw it up. Well done to the devs! Uninstalling as the devs don't even seem to be responding to anyone regarding this issue.,Negative
"The characters, story and gameplay is really enjoyable. The world is very emersive and dynamic, I liked it a lot",Positive
3 stars as of right now story and mechanics are good. My only complaint is I goofed and linked the account to a wrong hoyo account and I can't transfer it as if this time.,Positive
"how come some of the reviews are blaming hoyoverse for their potato phone's performance being laggy lol,, like bro if you yourself admit that your phone is low performance, don't be surprised if it lags üíÄ,, that's not primarily hoyo's fault,,, my phone is many years old already and it runs the game perfectly fine",Positive
Beautiful game! Subpar experience when playing on the phone but very good on tablet (S8+). -1 star for the terrible re-roll process and huge data download.,Positive
The game is good in fact I actually like turn based rpg and was hooked on this game but I don't have a high end phone to run this so I had quite a bitter experience but it doesn't matter I had fun playing this but still I uninstalled it,Positive
"runs well on phone and pc. make to make a proper hoyoverse account if you plan to play both. if you like turn based games, you ll love this game. very f2p friendly.",Positive
"This game was really interesting. The story line myabe get a little to boring but overall it's good, the characters design was pretty and detail",Positive
Gameplay gets repetitive over time to the point I'd rather watch paint dry. Story is okay but to me it's really boring but it's good to see reoccurring characters from Hi3. Please add a skip function for story. It's slowly eating away my mentality,Negative
"what's the point of a friend list bro, you can't chat, can't do coop, just throw it away, that's a friend feature lol üòÇüòÇ. It's the same as an offline game",Negative
"Exceptional graphics, amazing combat system for turn based rpg lover and a really good story so far. I am left wanting more",Positive
Nice graphics even at the lowest setting. optimization is also good since i don't expirience lag at all in my low end device unlike Genshin... Anyways Good Game:),Positive
It's fun but there is a lot of graphics issues like it freezing during combat and plain getting choppy at certain points but a great game overall,Negative
"Best turn base live service game out there, and hopefully can exceed more! Story is amazing and gameplay pretty fun but i hope there will be more mechanics in the future",Positive
"Great game, but once you finish the story and quest there's nothing much else to do beside simulated universe/forgotten hall. Please add multiplayer /pvp or maybe guild /more content/events for end game players",Positive
"I really love this game, the dialogue id very fun and in my opinion more interesting than Genshin's I am still pretty early in this game so I don't know if it will suddenly get bad but so far really fun! :D",Positive
"Honestly the game is very good and good character designs and theres something lacking whenever im stuck somewhere theres no jump button to escape, so its very laggy.",Negative
Was kinda fun for about 2 weeks. Not really anything worth doing in the game other than spending money and the energy system is awful.,Negative
It's fun but there is a bug where I got a 5 star and I went to upgrade it and it was just gone. It took my 10 warps and the stuff I got from the warps. So I just paid 10 warps to get nothing,Positive
"Great game overall! Undertale vibes in interactions, interesting content and storyline! Just rmb to be smart when grinding, or you might be in a tight spot in the endgame",Positive
I'm not really a fan of turn based game so I'm not really that excited about this game when I heard that it's gonna be turn based but honkai star rail is different.like hear me out the story of this game hello??? So good?? I Iuv reading so this game clearly for me i literally collect every book I came across HAHAH.The lore is just so Interesting to me.,Positive
I've been waiting for this ever since the Beta release~ The gameplay much likedly improve and I especially love the character designs throughout the story.,Positive
"The first time i installed it, then played it for a while, my phone getting hotter like fast as hell. Not like the other games that i played . But dev your game killing my battery fast pls fix it.",Negative
"I love this game, most of the people complain about bugs, but their hardware never reaches the minimum requirements, so stop hating the game and get a better device.",Positive
"Great Story, graphic, arts, all are good. The dev even care about a little thing like how you can interact with trash can and the trash cans even have their stories",Positive
"The story of the game is interesting, and the dialogues of the main character give us the choice of how the character's behavior should be. I just wish I had more luck with Warp.ü§û",Positive
"Love the gameplay, the maps, the turn-based fights, the characters, the story, well everything !",Positive
"The game crash alot, is not like a smooth launch on this game. Low down all the graphic still crash ü§£ Oh well, you need alot of work to do Worst launch i ever played, crash till i wanna uninstall Investing in this game was not worthy And most pity those player trying to backup. Unfortunately saying my phone cheap and not enough higher spec, but my geshin impact & honkai impact 3rd doesnt crash at all ü§£ Common sense please players.",Negative
"it's a good game and i do enjoy it, but i'm not a fan of turn base game so it kinda disappointment for me but i do love the story and absolutely the characters designüòö",Positive
"For turn base system is ok for me but other system like weapon, char leveling, char rank up, equipment, and also gacha is more like genshin than honkai, although this game have honkai in the title. Even the story, Herrscher iconic honkai powerful char don't exist until now. So if you from honkai impact and play this game you only get honkai char that have same design and name in this game (except welt) for other is genshin base. Sorry for the spoiler",Negative
"The game is good, but the app doesn't work most of the time. Keep getting a login error, had to uninstall to keep my sanity.",Negative
Loving the game so far. OSTs are amazing and classic turn based combat with a few quirks is great.,Positive
I'm going to 5 star if u fix the laging and the grafic.even I'm using blackshark 5 pro can't get perfect grafic.i will spend money for this game if u fix it.it so unsteady..plz fix..overall the game superb.need an good grafic,Negative
"I had made 3 accounts just to reroll a female character but no, I got 3 male characters even though there's only 2 male and 5 female 5 star that I could get for pity. I just wished they atleast let us pick as a first 5 star. this is completely biased so sue me",Negative
"Classic p2w dumpster fire. Play through a tutorial to discover a p2w shop, then you have to sell your house to afford to play on a competitive level. No thanks, would rather pay for a decent game.",Negative
"On the most up to date phone I could get, good internet and stable connection, and yet the loading screen will not progress past 50% no matter what I do. I even tried my portable hotspot, nothin",Negative
So nice to see Honkai variants. ü•∫üíñüíê The exploration is fun! Perfect for casual players who want something exciting but has very little free time!,Positive
The game is gun but after the update i can't log in due to log in error 1001_3 i been trying to log in like 10 time or more for two days and i still can't log in even my DNS is off ( android player),Positive
"At first, i dont really expecting much since i was never play a turn based game,so its my first time. But, it changes! The story,character AND gameplay was soo good.Well done Mihoyo!",Positive
"One of the best turn based games ever made (yes turn based this isn't Genshin) excellent music, graphics, and strategy. Will be playing this as my main for now",Positive
Finally have a new game to play previously was playing genshin impact love the graphics all and the characters some were similar to the previous game and also the map but the pulling part was epic love the cute character pompom really love him! üòò,Positive
"Everytime time i ""tap the screen"" I see error log in I don't know what is wrong l'm sorry but am disappointed a little . I really like this game but....Arrgh",Negative
"Fun game, I enjoy the story and characters. Pick up rates for characters is by far the worst though. Only reason I rate it 4/5 instead of 5/5.",Positive
"Entertaining and promising start, as someone who only liked to play action type rpgs this game's turn based combat system introduced a lot of room for strategy that I was not expecting.",Positive
"I, as someone who plays genshin impact, so far love Honkai star rail. I didn't think I would love it as much as I do. It's a different game, a with a mix of what I love and enjoy. Keep up the good work.",Positive
Best Honkai game. Beats most of the well known brand games out there. Love the story and the game system is perfect. Just like a good old RPG game should be. 5 stars+,Positive
This game is very fun!! even thou we can't jump it's very very Fun! I love this! the character designs are very unique and Beautiful,Negative
It becomes boring & repetitive after a week. Gacha pity carry over is good but F2P income is meager. No event nothing to do after almost 2 weeks launch. Drop rate of material in catalyx is too low that it's frustrating.,Negative
"I'm going to absolutely love this game! When it comes to turn base games I'm still learning but it's gonna be all worth it, since it's was created by the same creator as genshin I'm looking forward to it!",Positive
"Everything was going great till i installed the new update. The background doesnt load anymore making it unplayable, i re-installed it but nothing was happening",Negative
"A over all very fun and generous game, knows what the player base wants, willing to make very fast quality of life changes. Decent story tho I do wish we had an actual protag instead of a silent one. Great dev team tbh.",Positive
Please fix the disconnection issue on the iOS and Android. Feels very frustrating when I already almost beat the boss suddenly the game lost connection for no reason,Positive
I'm trying to play but once I hit start all I see is a train but nothing is happening I've restarted multiple times deleted and reinstalled but still the same thing so I'm deleting the before I can even play shame,Negative
Game crashes a lot on phone. Frequently on pc as well. Terrible cash grab gotcha rates (1/90). Power creep 3 months into the game. Stay far away.,Negative
"Honestly, just play genshin impact. This game is just a turn-based genshin-wannabe. Same trashy rates, but amazing character designs to draw you into wasting time and money on another game. Ill say it again for the people in the back... the rates be trashy and have me presssssedddd üòÇ",Negative
"i know this game just came out like 5 to 6 days ago?!?! but pls put some messaging or text feature in this game, so that I can message my friends in the game üò≠ but my overall gaming experience in this game is so far the best!!! i can see myself playing this game in a long run!",Positive
"I've had no problems playing this on my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. It's a very fun game, the writing is great and the story is extremely interesting.",Positive
"Im not a fan of turn based gameplay and there is an option for autoplay on combat too, makes me feel lazy üòÖ but graphics is really good.",Negative
Love everything about the way it works and also the character there what I call cool in many ways. This game deserves more than 5 star. Thanks for letting us play such a wonderful game üéÆ.,Positive
Its great...but only if it wasn't turned based. Why did you make it turn based. That is so annoying. üò≠ Ok just discovered the fake co-op. Can't go to friends world. What's the point of this :/ Just remove it.,Negative
"This game is really fun!! I love the game play, the graphics and the character designs! hoyo probably put so much effort to this game.",Positive
I waited this game so quite a month's now nothing disappointed me I am happy with this game but I don't rlly the turn based style and it also take quite long time to finish the enemies if play style is like honkai impact and genshin then it's good,Positive
"Good game,but after the update I doesn't open there's no train and I'm stuck in the lobby,a shame I'll be taking to my grave I tried everything I had 70 pulls ready for silver wolf but if it kept being like this,I'd be forced to delete it",Positive
"Really some people can't even read,, this game was advertised as a turn-based rpg, & here you are complaining because it was turn-based game, what an idiots, The game is quite good, the story is more interesting than genshin,",Positive
"I excitedly waited for it, but then the fight needs to be in turn unlike in genshin i had to uninstall. For some reason the fights in genshin was the exciting part so i was expecting a lot in this game.",Negative
Gud game perfectly balanced also main point is i can build whatever character I want also gacha are basically just like game work fine but still need to optimize coz my mob have dimensity8200 some reason it keep crash like when I play for 1 hours straight other then pretty solid game,Positive
It's a beautiful game but I'm having trouble with a few fight maybe nerf the recovery system( enemies after break).,Positive
"I really enjoy this game because it is similar to genshin. The characters,lore and gacha is really cool. The designs of the planets are amazing and I think hoyo did a great job üëç",Positive
"5 star because Bladies exist lol I like the story telling in Belobog, the map is easy as well. But in Luofu, the map is so confusing, or probably I'm just direction blind. With recent updates, it becomes pretty good :3",Positive
Great graphics and unique gameplay but it's not that optimized sometimes it's not responsive and not as snappy like genshin impact but then overall very great game,Positive
Once you reach Account level 30-40. Nothing to do with the game Energy farming not efficient 40 per run ? Almost 5runs for 180 Energy Cap with terrible drop rate. Reality Log in for 10-20minutes and log out.,Negative
"Like I was so hyped for this game and when is out is so fun. And is better then genshin on mobile in my opinion cause less laggy but like if ur graphic is above very low, the entire map is white. Which hoyoverse somehow fix this in patch 1.2. c:",Positive
A game I'm very glad to have had advertised to me. This is among my new favorite games and the music adds so much more to the game. So awesome!,Positive
"This game is so simple and beautiful. So many hot and beautiful characters and the storyline is so good, plus the trash cans!! It's really funny",Positive
"Probably the best Turn based game . Easy gameplay, incredible animation, great story . A must play.",Positive
Some crashes here and there but the game is so fun and story is really interesting and engaging so far so I will continue to support and play.,Positive
the game was hyped up so much and then on release it turned out the attack style was in turns and not like honkai impact 3rd. all around it could have been a good game and I don't know why they thought it was a good idea to change the attack style. would not reccomend,Negative
Very good game. I log on to look at the nice visuals for a bit and then log off. I already beat the game waiting for dlc to come out soon I can't wait,Negative
"cognosphere put a game on the play store, that's not even released yet... also, I just realized this is a turn based rpg, based on what a few others have said about this game, nty cognosphere, turn based rpgs are not only super repetitive and bland nowadays but they tend to be the biggest cash grabs as well, even moreso in this game's case with the addition of the usual gacha system, I'll stick with genshin",Negative
"I am receiving a Error login issue, 1001_3 and I've tried every possible option, uninstall reinstall, clearing cache and data, re-verify the integrity and I'm still getting an issue logging in",Negative
Nothing why because I can't open. I download all the resources and granted permission but still I can't open it when I start the game there's an error code 1001_2 üòî,Negative
One of the most disappointing games of 2023. The combat is so basic and the voice over is plain terrible. It's clearly trying to bait you with the graphics. It's just an RPG with a Genshin skin.,Negative
It's pretty fun lately and it has amazing graphics but it has a lot of bugs which is really annoying me.,Positive
"Discount Genshin Impact, but with boring, unskippable story dialogues. Simple reused enemy assets, n drop rates as low as genshin impact. You'll be gacha-ing main characters n skill cards for d most part. Other than a tremendously slow n painful grind, i was nt hving fun at all. Trailblazer level: 18. Played 3 days in a row.",Negative
Good game nice graphics But Sometimes I get some fps drop but my is a 16 gb ram gaming phone ? You should optimize this game in next update overall game is good üòäüòä and you should add a normal combat system this new system is very complicated,Positive
"Can't skip annoying cutscenes kror dialogue, Being a mobile centered all these cutscenes and dialogue jusy overstuff, would really like to see a skip option.",Negative
"Having higher frame rate ""FPS""only be exclusive to ISO devices is monopoly, with that said it's a great game I've been enjoying the story so far, it's unfortunate that my latest android gaming device is capped at 60fps",Negative
The game won't play. It keeps saying it can't log in. I have tried registering through hoyo and through Facebook. I would really like to play this game,Negative
"Dear Developer Team, The Update Patch is too big (6GB), please consider players who play using mobile data because they can't provide wi-fi. It takes so much data just to update",Negative
I can be a trash can and fight trash king totally 5 star.....the game dialog totally memeable..make me forget the game and go for the humor in this....ps: dont read some description in the game if you don't want to be rick roll,Positive
"I love the game okay, But after 1.3 update i can't enter anymore... It's Day two but I'm STILL STUCK AT THE LOADING SCREEN. I'm not even using VPN or Proxy Settings, All I freaking did is Update and Download the resources... What's more is that I have no Issues entering Genshin (Hoyoverse's Other Game) after their update.",Negative
1* for stunning graphic 1* for nice VA -1* too many dialogs and unskipable my thumbs so tired because the dialogs load too dam slow -1* for god sake cant even turn off the ultimate? I know its so dam cool but when u watch something cool 100x it become ugly shi -1* gacha so exp the reward are not balance,Negative
"""Oh, jolly well done to the developers of this splendid Honkai: Star trail! This must have been a jolly good effort to bring such realistic fighting experience to our fingertips. Cheers to you chaps!""",Positive
"the story is great,This the character animation while using skill is awesome you deserve 6 star,I just hope it won't get boring just like Genshin.....anyway thanks for your game I really appreciate it ..",Positive
"Absolutely love this game! Peak story line full of comedy, drama and sadness, amazing character designs. It's well made! My friend recommended me this game now I'm recommending this to everyone",Positive
When I change my graphics into medium all the surrounding in game texture became all white and when I tried to change it back to low graphics it stayed the same maybe my low end device couldn't just handle this game I want to try play this game when I have a proper nice phone in the future,Negative
"Exclusive for high-ended devices. Stuck in loading screen and I don't this game is suited for my taste. Thanks, anyway. I tried.",Negative
I was really looking forward to playing this then i saw that it needs to download 7GB IN ORDER TO PLAY IT! please make it take less storage or add it to gforce now.,Negative
The English voice acting actually made me want to throw up. It was AWFUL. Switched it to another random language just so I wouldn't have to hear that assault on my ear drums,Negative
I can't play outside my house using my mobile data because of the 1001_1 error. This only works using wifi which is frustrating as I am out for work all the time.,Negative
"This game would be great if it was for the warp system. 3 10 pulls I got nothing but light cones...it completely ruins the game. This is why mobile games are a joke, it's for gambling addicts.",Negative
I installed the game but after downloading the resources. I was stuck in the waiting screen for an hour. Also tried reinstalling but it didn't fix,Negative
"Good game so far. Excellent graphic, cool turn based RPG gameplay, satisfying audio. Really enjoyed the game.",Positive
It's not even open world then why im getting like 20-25 fps at very low setting. Even genshin impact runs around 30 at custom settings. I expected it to run like PGR even though that's not even turned based. And it runs so smooth(60>) at high settings. I'm disappointed.,Negative
One of the best turn base games I've played. People who gave bad reviews for this are either Genshin only players who never played anything beside genshin or people who lack skill in turn base,Positive
It's very fun! And I truly recommend it! The characters are well designed and the chats are creative since I've never seen it! Keep up the good work,Positive
"Really great game, story good, sound tracks good, animations top, character designs, combat are really outstanding. 10/10 game",Positive
"So far, this game is a love letter to Hyperion commanders, I enjoy every second playing it and the optimization is amazing, well done.",Positive
"The game is amazing.. the graphics, story, characters all them are cool but it just feels like a waste that the game is role playing...",Positive
I've experience hard time on logging IN when i use mobile data. It wasn't able to proceed to game. When i use wifi it's okay but i can't play ir when im using mobile data.,Negative
"Overall experience is great, it just keeps crashing, disconnecting and showing log in errors every now and then please fix this",Positive
I been play ur game it cool but it too lag and crash while i play i hope u put low graphic on setting idc if it look so pixel at least i can enjoy the experience on ur game maybe i will give ur game 5 start(u can put settings button on loading screen),Negative
"Great high production value gacha game with solid unique mechanics. Only issue is the rates, which are typically bad. But by comparison, a great new experience.",Positive
"No matter what i try, the game refuses to load on mobile. It works fine on pc but it always gives me error code 200 on my phone and i still cannot play. Please fix",Negative
"Way to goddamn hard to sign up. It's so goddamn infatuating how difficult they make it, it's almost like they don't want you to play. It keeps saying some BS of ""email already exists"" when I haven't even made an account yet. This sucks",Negative
"Why do the game crash when I am downloading the update, I wait for a whole hour for it to download but it crash at the end. Is the downloading update working properly, please fix it",Negative
Already off to a bad start why make the game available to download when you cant even play it then on the official date when you should be able to play the game your hit with a bunch of errors. I've delete the app around 3 times hoping that it would solve the issue nope.,Negative
"This is the best game ever than the other game. The power, characther, and a story line, its like I am imagination! I am very like this game. But, how to defeat Bronya? Its very hard to figth! Thats by me. I hope you can explain this, haha! üòä",Positive
"The game works perfectly from the release till now, while my main issue is multiple attempt of login needed, now the game cannot even be accessed, uninstalled until a fix is done by the developer.",Negative
The story of this game is very different and interesting from gensin impact. The graphic animation are all an another level,Positive
It's a turn based Star Ocean that's better than the newer Star Ocean games. Could not get into genshin or honkai3 but this one looks to be a keeper because it's turn based.,Positive
"Cool turn based action game. I really likes it, the story is good as the other games. Ngl it's interesting to play Honkai: Star Rail, I can't wait for Kafka as a playable character in the future",Positive
This game is awesome and great I've been loving it so far but there's this login error that occurs while it fixes randomly it really does frustrate me,Negative
"The resource grind/gem income is absolutely horrendous. Barely playable, though it has a lot of potential. Nevermind the gold tickets at least give us silver tickets to make the account PLAYABLE.",Negative
"I've been stuck on the login screen for ages and it always says that there's an error, I've tried everything from people with similar problems but it just doesn't work for me :/",Negative
"I thought it's an RPG but it's turned based. God graphics and story telling, but I've had my fill of turn based games.",Positive
"The game is fantastic. The characters, graphics, gameplay, combat are phenomenal! Fully recommend it!",Positive
"Been waiting awhile for this one now, and I am not disappointed. Most gacha RPGs lose me after the honeymoon period, but I can see myself playing this one for some time.",Positive
"Hoyo did it again. Best mobile release since Genshin, and it has so much better writting. Love it. Now excuse me, I need to go explore all the trash can lore.",Positive
After I finished 1 hr long tutorial I got a 5 star character. I was excited but left for the work. When I came back I had to pass the tutorial again and didn't get any 5 star character . Nice..,Negative
Very boring & repetitive after a week. Very scarce income for F2P. It's been 2 week and no sign of event. Quite disappointing after the hyped on launch. Overall 2.5/5.,Negative
"I'm not a fan of Turn-Based Games since i think it's pretty boring, but this game piqued my interest especially with Interesting Game Mechanics and good character design unlike some Turn-Based games that just give you a 2d Chibi version of the character you use",Positive
"Great game, high qualily and different from Genshin Impact. Auto Combat AI still needs improvement, like March 7th.",Positive
"Revising my review: it's a good old addicting game. I love the characters and the setting, and it's not as grindy as Genshin. (Please never make it as grindy as Genshin.)",Positive
I love this game but there's a big where you try screen record and it just kinda goes static. 5 stars cause I don't really care about screen recording but can put some things down,Positive
"Dead game. No misions, no story, no event. Other turnbase game have a long story. Like easy, normal, hard. 2 week playing is enough to uninstall this game.",Negative
"This game gets a 5 star rating because it executes the turn based strategy game well, has a great story, great characters, and values its players well. The free limited 5 star, Dr. Ratio, proves that Hoyoverse cares about the Honkai series as a whole.",Positive
"Very fun, the dialog is really funny, exploration is good as always. But I want my own room to customize in the express. Other than that, good job Mihoyo!",Positive
"Please optimized your game, i could run gensin smoothly on the lowest setting, but i can't here, even on the lowest setting theres so many frame drops my character couldn't even move, please fix it cause i really wanna play this game",Negative
Superbly made. I got this recommended from playing other Hoyoverse games and this one doesn't disappoint! The game is smooth even on mobile and the world is immersive.,Positive
"Great game, great graphics but I wish Hoyoverse would implement more co-op features to the game, like guild bosses and more friends support features.",Positive
"Would have liked to play, but it just gets stuck on the opening screen....I know it's not my device, I run genshin on it and many other games just fine...",Negative
"A stellar adventure so far can't wait to see what else comes to this game, hopefully some cool mounts and skippable cut scenes and some interactive multiplayer in the future",Positive
I think it's the best game that I ever play in my life.The graphics and gameplay and other are very smooth and I like it ü§©.Thank you for your hard work for making this game. That's why I give you these 5 ‚≠ê,Positive
"The game storyline is very interesting as different people got their own style and characteristics The game design,quality and mechanics are very smooth",Positive
The game never passes the initial login screen. Says global error. Really wanted to play this game. Another disappointment.,Negative
"um for some reason my honkai starail has been having error or tip messege everytime i try to play the game or start it even it just say ""login error occured please try again later error code 1001_2 this happened i think 3~8 times cause i guess i tried everything i changed my acc 3 times changing the servers and even downloading it again and again but nothing ill just say this but this is not a complaint its just that i want my game fixed or be playable",Positive
"you know what? this is really cool game, nostalgic with turn base gameplay. to all of u guys, said stuck on loading, laggy or etc. Just accept it, ur phone its not good enough for this game. Go throw ur phone and buy a new oneüòÇüòÇ",Positive
"Won't even let me log in, I checked everything and nothing is working it keeps saying log in error and constantly restarts my game when I'm trying to fix it.",Negative
"Good game in early stages, later on you will be required to have certain characters to advance which is generally behind a pay wall. be advised.",Negative
Excellent the first game on the phone that reminds me of a console and they don't bombard you with pay to win opinions and the graphics and voice overs perfect,Positive
"This game is really nice good graphics, the design, and the characters are so detailed. Overall THIS GAME IS SOO GOOD!",Positive
"I love this game. The graphics, the humor, the voice acting the little bits of lore scattered around. Amazing work.",Positive
Very fun relaxing game with good graphics and story.Combat is also good alongwith music.Only downside is that premium currency is hard to get so you have to plan accordingly.,Positive
Silverwolf is a hacker why give her a meelee weapon. And she gives off graffiti. Seriously hackers suppose to be at the back hard to reach and most of the time annonymous. She is just created to be flashy but they are not thinking what an actual hacker really do.,Negative
I was stuck in the start loading when i pressed it says Log in occured Cannot be loaded but when it was only 9:50 to 10:00 its okay but when i tried to play at 12 pm it just say log on occured cannot be loaded,Negative
"It keeps on crashing after downloading the needed resources, i didn't got a chance to play it and it also bringing me back to my homescreen,total disappointment tbh",Negative
"Game is good, it's smooth, but the first bost fight when im done killing it , it spawns these more monsters and then i lag and it keeps kicking me out like how do i fix it üò°üò≠üò±üòú",Negative
"So clever and quirky, great QOL features, fun character design. Really enjoying it and a nice change of pace from Genshin even with many similarities.",Positive
"Love the game, but one issue i have is its annoying that we can't walk off platforms that are short...and have to take the stairs to get off",Positive
"Gameplays fun, story is pretty good, dialogue can be very bad/cringe(especially in messages), and the gacha is not as bad as I thought it'd be.",Positive
"As a veteran of turn based games, this one's pretty addicting. Hoyoverse really learned from HI3 and genshin. Also, it runs pretty well in my potato phone and laptop",Positive
I enjoy myself is very fun. But put at lease little bit easy on me because I get beat 2 times do get me wrong I love a good challenge but little bit easy.,Positive
A. Cinematics do lag most of the time in mobile phone that you have to tap and hold your phone screen. I am using Samsung S10 5G it us suppose to handle this kind of game. B.,Positive
Umm i have iqoo7. Device i am playing in max settings but it's overheating that's why my game laggy i don't know why maybe bad optimization i can't take this anymore please do something about when i started enjoying this game but it's heating a lot how can I play this game for so long.,Negative
"Amazing game, played on an s20 FE until the story caps out for now. No major bugs, few crashes on day 1 but other than that it's been flawless",Positive
"Amazing game. It has great combat mechanics, the story is interesting, there is a lot of comedy and most importantly there is no Paimon.",Positive
would likento be able to give a good review unfortunately I can't as the game took that long to download that I got bored and after about 10 mins uninstalled it. I have a brand new Samsung so it's not my phone that's the issue. hopefully this can be resolved,Negative
"I rate this 10/10 , this game is really good but i want to suggest a co op mode , can chat with friends and can battle with them also , so make it more fun",Positive
i overall like the game it's a good game but my problem is about fps and graphics i can handle the graphics but the fps it's dropping hopefully hoyovers will fix something about the fps for mobile players so that we can enjoy the game more,Positive
I cant play the game because the loading screen is too laggy!!! This game is not recommend for low end devices!! Please fix the loading screen ISTG.,Negative
"The game is awesome but, can you help me fix the graphics? The surroundings turned blinding white. Is that suppose to be part of the game?",Positive
"Very nice game with impressive storytelling and funny reply options, love the gameplay as well :) and thanks for giving it auto mode during battles.",Positive
"Beautiful, fun, action packed. Great story and game play is amazing. If you like turn based rpgs, this one is a must play.",Positive
Fun! Love the story and writing more than Genshin. The character designs are interesting and having characters from Honkai in the roster makes me even more excited as a long time HI3 fan.,Positive
"This game is great, thought at first i wouldn't stay for long cause its turn base game but i did, its amazing game animation, bgs, everything is great, love it.",Positive
"Ridiculously polished and well made, u can feel the passion of the dev from every corner of the game As a long time turn based rpg enjoyer this have potential to be the best one out there, excited to see the future of the game",Positive
"If it would be the early access release, I would close my eyes on the lack of content, but the state of 1.0 version is unacceptable for a gacha game with so high prices on item rolls, etc. Genshin Impact release was been more entertaining than the release of Honkai Star Rail. There are a plenty of turn-based gacha games with more meaningful daily activities even at the release of the first version. My verdict is 3/5 stars. Only for good storytelling and gameplay potential.",Negative
Great. Easy to obtain rewards and tye rewards are very generous. The male mc expressions are quite dull and awkward I would love to see more expressions for him.,Positive
"super cool! love the characters. another banger from hoyoverse. the only negative reviews ive seen are complaining about their own hardware and not the actual game, so the rating is higher than it appears",Positive
From what I've been hearing/reading it's a good game I'm willing to give it a chance but it keeps crashing when ever I try installing the data please fix this its unpleasant for my and others experience:/,Negative
"Still crashes a lot on android devices, has issues with log in. Always tells me I have log in error so I have to log in again and again.",Negative
"Please add controller support! Especially with the official PS5 launch and with controller support for the PC client, this is unexcusable. Otherwise, great game.",Negative
"Bro, I pulled the regular wrap (*10) 3 times already and the games bugged 2 times. 20 star stellar wrap disappeared. How am I supposed to play the game if this keep happening bro.",Negative
Great game so far The experience is similar to what you experience in a persona game or maybe the remake of ffVII but turn based The exploration is really similar to FE and that's well appreciated after genshin impact,Positive
"It is great! I got logged out when I was at level 43 I think, and I lost all my progress and it made me restart. So I'm not happy about that.",Negative
"Unskipable dialogues, cutscenes again. No option for guest account or reset account. You literally learn nothing from Genshin Impact, people demand skipable dialogues, cutscenes and you delivered nothing.",Negative
"Hands down THE BEST GAME ever! I stopped playing Dislyte because of this game. This game doesnt feel like a mobile game at all, its so much like a console RPG. Got hooked from day one.",Positive
Everything is just stellar. The grind is a bit tediously slow but it's manageable. Can't wait to play this on console.,Positive
"this game is really goodd!! Despite some of the bugs in the gameüò≠ but star rail is really fun to play more than i expected, as a genshin player its really enjoyful to play this new released game :))",Positive
A mix of old school JRPG and a qwirky space opera SciFi story based game. You'll either like it or hate it. Guess which group I'm a part of.,Positive
"You may be wondering, hm why did this person do a 3 star review? Well i made a 3 star review because when i try to login on the game it says error login occured error code 1001_1 ( 2 or 3 ) which gatekeeps me from playing if this is fixed, ill change it to a 5 star review because i really love the game and this is the only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 star",Negative
The lack of a skip cutscene and skip dialogue option really sucks. Some of these take way too long.,Negative
"The best turn base rpg game i've tried so far. Good job hoyoverse!! Really like the story, the characters. Keep up the best !!!",Positive
"Kinda funny, This game is way more laggier than Genshin Impact despite having small world to render the lag is unbearable. The game mechanic is way too simplified that it became so boring.",Negative
Fantastic game it may be a Rpg Battle system strike on the foes enter the battle the storyline is the place that you never been before Hoyverse keep up the good work of the game development!!,Positive
The enemies are way too strong. It's like fighting level 10s and you're a level 2. Really unfair game.,Negative
"I really love Honkai and its generosity on rewards, but the bugs (bad ones) aren't really enjoyable. The world keeps on glitching and the introduction screen is laggy. Please fix this, Hoyoverse.",Negative
The dailes only require you to spend all your energy and you can claim it which is THE BEST!! unlike genshin that you need to do 4 quests and talk to an npc too time consuming.,Positive
"Ngl the more I play the game the more interesting it is. The only thing I wish to change in thr future is for the main story to be a bit longer, last batch was way too short in my opinion",Positive
"Fun game so far, but please add more controller support. Specifically the Stadia controller. I've read that plenty of others aren't supported either.",Negative
"Game is good but pls make the garantee 4 star on the 10 roll to be only a hero and not a lightcone. Also can you make the lightcone banner cheaper or at least be able to use the normal tickets on it, no one will ever use the premium tickets or gems instead of roll for a character.",Negative
"Best game so far for me, not time consuming, took only 5 min to complete the daily mission, exploring is good and the story is amazing on point!ü§åü§å",Positive
Change my rating from 5 to 4. Idk why after 1.2 update my game lag out when cutscene start to happen... it keep doing that despite my phone having soo much space and RAM. Can you guy fix this?,Positive
"The memes and references are hilarious, the gameplay is pretty smooth and I didn't encounter any issues while playing the game. Great game !",Positive
"I'm excited because I'm a fan of Honkai, but I can't seem to get past the start up page after I press start the game loads for a while but it crashes I even cleared my data for this app but damn it won't still load!",Negative
"interesting storyline, Beautiful soundtrack, prizes or events that always attract players' attention and also a gacha system that is not too difficult to get characters.",Positive
Now I have been playing this game for 5 days and now it's showing login error from yesterday. No matter how much I restarted the game the same login error occured on the screen,Negative
"The game dont wanr mw ro log in. It always says ""too many requests"" i dont even change my email. Even if a make a new account always ""too many requests"" its frustrating. Fix this bug/issue in account login. I've try installing ang reinstalling the game still nothing change. PLEASE FIX THIS!",Negative
"After updating, i want to claim level reward, but the game always crashes whenever i talk with pompom. Also, for the main quest, i can't progress bcs the scene keep crashing. I have restart my phone, butnothing change",Negative
I love this game 10/10 Way better than genshin much more reward even tho its not as openworld like genshin and the mechanic of the fighting style is very different honkai star rail is much more turn based while genshin is much more open world fighting style and there is always be power creep and it already happen to hsr and genshin,Positive
Leagues better than the other game of the same company. Currently giving away a free amazing 5 star character (and it's not even their anniversary yet). It aready has better end game events. And is more generous to its player base.,Positive
Why are you forcing me to listen to most of the dialogue? I keep trying to skip and it just speeds up a little. Then they still try to say all of it! There's no skip dialogue option for some dumb reason. I do t care about lore. I just wanna collect characters and play the damn game,Negative
"I love this game, i've been playing almost 2 months from now, it's so fun and help me release my stress, the stories for each characters is well written, good job hoyo, keep it up",Positive
Best mobile game ever!! All the characters are aesthetically pleasing and story is top tier! Very f2p friendly and not too time consuming . Keep it up Hoyoverse!,Positive
The game itself is really good but write as soon as the update the latest one happened it's been really buggy and it Kix you off the game I'm about to be level 36 Please fix this..... And now with this new update it won't even let me update it says Errorüòíüò°ü§¨üë∫ fixx it,Negative
"I've beeb playing this game for 7 months. Quite fun, the story is good, love the turn based system. The art is good. Hope it will be more better in the future",Positive
I hadn't played this game for about a months and why when it was downloaded the patch the apps automatically shut itself down and kick me out? Can you please fixed this bug? I wanted to play it again...,Negative
"Unreal storyline, soundtrack and gameplay for a game that is free! One of the best and memorable boss fights in gaming history!",Positive
Enjoying the game so much. Endgame are challenging but gets easier as time gets. New events are fun. Overall a 5/5,Positive
This game is fun and as good storyline and good lore so I highly recommend you play this game and if you don't like turn base still try it I don't like turn base but I still like it and when I read about the aeons and I just gott Rick rolled I am kinda mad but it is funny and how many time do you get Rick rolled in game.,Positive
First gacha I've ever really gotten into. Saw someone playing it on public transport. Looked it up and downloaded it. Played daily ever since. Please add controller support for backbone,Positive
"it's pretty good, took up my storage so I had to delete it, anyway, it feels like I've played genshin over again, the combat system is really good tho, it's hard to understand at first but it's pretty good.",Positive
After the recent patch I'm unable to play as the game continues to crash. I have this on ps5 but I just don't want to lose all my 5 stars I invested in.,Negative
"Thank you for improving the game. Now I no longer experience lagging whenever there's cut scene. Great gameplay, generous rewards.",Positive
Best game cognosphere have ever made. There is just one issue that in Asia server whenever the cutscene start their is audio lagging a lot. So please do something about it.,Positive
After the update the game textures are bugged and is extremely impossible to play for a whole 10 minutes without having a headache because of the flashing textures that loads up,Negative
Update Version 1.2 review: the game keep crashing. It's unplayable. The game keep blinking and then kick me out of the game.,Negative
"I love it and have only had it for a few days... BUT!! The stupid Findie robot won't stop saying ""beep, beep, beep."" ""Just shut it up"" I would say... I had to turn down the volume all the way when it talks...",Positive
I really don't appreciate working my A off for those 90 pulls just to not pull the limited character it's depressing and de motivating frankly I haven't touch the game in months bcuz of that I worked to hard to not earn the character especially knowing how hard it is to farm no skip button so can't even speed up the story like bro atleast a skip button and the infinite back and fourth all that I endured at least let me hv what I worked for this game like genshin will only be popular among whales,Negative
"I just lost my account, I had a lot of characters, equilibrium level 61 and everything done,I quit before 1.3 and logged back today to find my account lost when I started game with the same Gmail and server,it played the starting cutscene. Pls help me üôè üôè",Negative
The music is amazing and it being turn based decreases the amount of storage it takes up which was the main problem with genshin i love it üëç,Positive
"Decent game, beautiful graphic, fun game play imo. But why its keep draining my data? I lost almost 30 GB in 3 days playing. Its not even a mmorpg. Hope this will be fixed.",Negative
It was fun until I got addicted so I just deleted this game today this game is awesome only problem is the fuel cap after you finish exploration and all the quest it's like opening the game to do daily which is actually not fun at all need some more content and I will resume this game again in like 2.0,Positive
"It's fun, yeah, but I feel like the voice acting is a little slow though and I was told I'd get 80 ""free pulls"" if I downloaded, but tbh I didn't and I'm just sitting here wondering why and how I'm even supposed to activate it",Negative
Does anybody share the feeling that he needs someone much needed buffs? The unit is basically useless without Tingyun. Investment costs in terms of relics are also extremely high in order to make him do atleast some dmg. Almost all ablity traces are also useless except the talent. And who thought it would be a good idea to not let basic attacks add stacks. Its a B-Tier unit in the current state if you take away his Tingyun. I will return my 5 stars when something is fixed.,Negative
"Phenomenal gameplay, amazing effects, great variety of characters, good storytelling, and did i mention generous devs? Lol. Thank u HSR devs for bringing us such a wonderful RPG game, looking forward to the next updates.",Positive
Great game but I have this bug where my character can only run and sometimes the game crashes. Edit: Works again!!!,Positive
"daily energy is very scarce compared to other turn based game. for example: epic seven. im fine not having as much as e7, but the current energy we can get per day is just too low to the point im fine giving this 1 star.",Negative
"How to fix error code 8 on Mobile ? Do i have to reinstall the game ? I'm not on wifi when i downloaded the latest update. When downloading , it prompt my phone to reboot the game , and when i did i keep getting error code 8 I can't even restart the update anymore and can't play the game",Positive
Okay who's ever idea was to put in a mega boss at the start of the game was a moron. I literally can't beat it in any way shape or form. I tried three times. Died three times. I'm deleting this game and never going back.,Negative
"Overall the storyline and the characters are pretty good, I also really like the gacha because it guarantees you a 50/50 after a few pulls, although that this is not really a game that I can play all day because I got quite bored of it quickly",Positive
"I really like this game but it's way too complicated for people like me, the style for me is just not it but I really do like this game but it's kinda not it, y'all this is my opinion don't hate, overall this game receives 3/5 just for the characters and storytime :)",Negative
Ive had an excellent overall experience i cant wait to see more content. Ive been playing on my phone and ps5 and its legit been effortless. Love the game!!!!,Positive
"3 hours later and still struggling to download resources? File is up to nearly 5GBs. Do not care how good of a game is, that is absurd. How much more space does this 1 game need? I deep clean a couple more GBs, and still stops the resource download. Tried to give it a try but its too much.",Negative
I didn't like this game cause of combat style and many more I was excited and pre installed game in mobile and obb files and last I open game and started playing exploration is good and many other thing is good but there are many other thing all player are complaining and my personal opinion is when I quit this game and come back again my all data gone and I have to played from start I mean if u can't manage our data then what am I even say .,Negative
"Classic MHY. Bad pulling system, samey-designs and design philosophy, and a meh story. The gameplay is much better than GI or HI3 though so if you like the MHY style I'd give it a chance. MHY just isn't for me.",Negative
"Good game but you need to and a freely gameplay in open World,like genshin impact (fighting monsters,exploring the secrets of the map etc.)",Negative
"This is honestly the best gatcha game of all time and my favourite game that has a mobile port. I mostly went out of my way to review the game, to fight the mindless genshin fans that are mad that they didn't get the rewards that we did and leave 1 star reviews when they haven't even played the game.",Positive
Hear me out. I enjoy playing HSR for almost 3 months since its release. But an IMPORTANT feature needs to add especially to battle mode ADD GUARD AND ITEM FEATURE PLEASEE!!!!,Negative
Sometimes the game crashes after teleporting between waypoints instantly (Like after defeating a stagnant shadow and teleporting to heal and again teleporting to the stagnant shadow) Rest everything thing is excellent,Positive
I don't know if i only the one who experiencing this but this game ended up crashing all the time when im in combat with the new character i restart many times but its always crashing please fix,Negative
"Great game with good animations, above average character models , story is great overall great game if you don't mind turn based rpg and have tons of storage to spare",Positive
"I like the game, but since 1.1 update came out, for some reason half of the train is missing, i can still play the game but in split second im immediately kick out the game, i hope this bug fixed.. i really miss playing hsr, I hope hoyo creators can respond to this bug or problem",Negative
"I love this game..The design,music, everything..This game is great as Honkai Impact 3rd and Geshin Impact! Except for this game no jumping that i have to walk down the stairs without jump my way out of it >: Still amazing as Top 1 beautiful and best anime game my goodness!",Positive
By calculation anyone who plays daily should get one 5 star pull every 2 months completely F2P. Story driven and non competitive nature of the game should not pressure anyone to overspend. Simulated universe is the best content.,Positive
"The best gacha game, no exaggeration. The story and characters are well executed, the humor lands, the chatting system with characters is amazing and the gameplay itself is fun. 10/10 would recommend",Positive
Love the story but it advertised 80 free pulls! But didn't specify you had to spend multiple hours to get all of said 80 free pulls! Definitely not a favorite,Negative
"I play this game for a few months, well it's quite interesting and I like the storyline also the characters development. Maybe I'll play this game again, because now I'm focused on Genshin Impact. Thank you as always Hoyoverse, it's my honor to know this game.",Positive
Simple beautiful.. The art work is amazing. The character design is outstanding really awesome storyline. I literally like everything is the game from puzz quest to insane boss fight... Great job,Positive
"Lost all my data progress from the beta to now after not playing for a small amount of time, which means and payments I also made are all gone as well. Fix this issue perhaps as quickly as possible??",Negative
"Honkai star rail is probably hoyoverses best game if you're a turn based kid, however because of this the gacha mechanics just don't work well. Being unable to sit and farm for relics kinda ruins the game due to how many characters you kind of need to build if you're f2p.",Positive
"Best gacha game ever!!! It has an awesome storytelling, all characters are likable and even the f2p ones are strong so you don't feel weak, the events are really enjoyable and have very good rewards, overall this game is a 10/10 the best turn based that I ever played.",Positive
i hate it it wouldn't give me the characters i want always light cone... i envy my boyfriend because of that i hate I've been playing it for like many months now and i had only thought my boyfriend to play 3 months ago yet he's got nice characters.. i really hate this game ..,Negative
"The pity system is very bad but overall the game is fun to play NGL the character is cool and also best design... But please for the love of god please fix the pity system, i had like 78 pity and dont get any 5 star warp but its okay i give 3 stars because of Kafka character and also asta TQ",Negative
"Absolutely amazing turn based game, if you like those I'd 100% recommend it. Especially because it's so free to play friendly. Awesome story too.",Positive
All goods. But its better if this game is compatible for controller. Its easy to move/play with the controller.,Positive
Love the graphics and turn based strategy. Also the gacha system is great with free ten pulls every new patch arrives. Still playing it after release,Positive
"Absolutely insane quality. Fun gameplay, incredible story. Awesome characters. First real event was a blast. Could use more summons but otherwise fantastic game.",Positive
Great game but why almost all of the characters Chinese names? The game's theme is outer space yet I'm seeing a lot of Chinese references. I get that Mihoyo is a CN company but please make some non Chinese characters too. Thanks.,Positive
I have near 1tb storage in my device and it tells me I have inadequate storage. I'm using a Chromebook Octopus with 256 GB memory and an SD card with 512 GB memory (it was saving to the card) downloads up to 7% and tells me inadequate storage? HOW????,Negative
"Edited my comment and rating. 5 star now as I can finally enjoy the game without log in errors. I am so unlucky in Genshin but the gods are on my side here in Star Rail. I got Jing Yuan with just 5 passes and Bailu from the beginner banner. Also Welt is amazing. Now I have other 5 star characters. I feel like it's easier to get a 5 star here than in Genshin idk. Anyway, Bailu is so so cute.",Positive
"Sesame Cake is the greatest creation ever. Trash Cake, Rice Dumpling and all the critters are the best thing in the game. 10/10 would recommend. Really want to have a pet system cause I want to adopt them all.",Positive
Engaging story. Surprisingly nuanced and interesting turn based gameplay and character system. Pretty decent gacha rates and freebies. Very pretty graphics and designs. Blade hot,Positive
"Perfect game, high quality characters amazing storylines , extremely good animation and fantastic backgrounds But I do suggest playing on a pc rather than a phone",Positive
Awsome game. I love the story like and the way its unlike to have a fighting style like that. But the characters and the powers and stuff have all good quality.,Positive
5 stars of cpurse from the game play and chracters and also the story about their friendship i have been deleted thid game for now because of some phone issue that my storage is full it's so heart shuttering for me to let go of my favorite game but i have to see you in the future my dear game i will collect all of tge characters i haveü•∞ü•∞ü•∞,Positive
"The game is fun and has really good mechanics and story, the only issue I have is the amount of Yuri and yaoi(gay innuendos) the game tends to drop on, I'm really not a fan of that, I would give 4-5 but with the amount of the above concerns I can only give 2",Negative
Fun game with an engaging story. Monetization doesn't feel predatory and it's perfectly playable f2p (I have not yet spent money on the game but plan to do so in the future.),Positive
"Surprisingly well made and tons of content for a free to play. You don't feel like it's required to spend money, but you are still incentivized to spend money",Positive
"Hoyoversw really never disappoints! Personally I like this more than I like genshin, really great storyline! And obviously all the other mechanics and characters are interesting and fun to play!",Positive
"Having fun with the game,story was good and the gameplay are the best,less grindy than genshin.game used to have bugs but now fixed.just looking foward for low storage options.",Positive
"Story and character interactions - 5 stars ; Everything else - 0 stars; Edit : As of patch 1.3, I will have to say that even the story and character interaction is going downhill. Infact it was going downhill since 1.2, but I thought maybe 1.3 will be better. Boy oh boy was I wrong. Please don't release story content if it's not complete",Negative
"I uninstalled this game as well as my Genshin Impact. Reasons: 1.) No pvp. 2.) Unskippable scenes. 3.) 60% scenes, 40% gameplay. 4.) Repititive gameplay. 5.) There's nothing to do when your fuel is 0. 6.) Poor gacha system. ü§¶",Negative
Lacking on android. Needs better optimization and controller support for something like the backbone.,Negative
"Amazing, but... It's a bit laggy sometimes. Maybe a few bugs, but overall I really love this game and will continue playing this game.",Positive
"I am editing my review for this game. This game truly deserves the awards! The devs have been generous so far, even giving out a free 5* limited unit. I'll make it a 5/5 if they improve the gacha rate, but overall the game is amazing and so are the devs!",Positive
"The game is fun and everything.However I feel like the game is missing something.No hate though,it would be much better if the combat was a little more exciting.I would still recommend this game.",Positive
"Love this game. It's simple, fun and interesting. The gameplay is extremely beginner friendly. The gacha part is a little annoying at times, but still love this game",Positive
"I really love it. The cutscenes, musics, designs, even the environment and silly things you can do in this game. Highly recommended!",Positive
"Great game. Now you might ask, why am I rating it two stars? Because the device support is just stupid. Even help desk is useless and I must either buy a new phone or just stop playing. Sucks that I wasted over 50 hours on this game.",Negative
Summon rate is garbage. Optimization is needed. Many QOL improvements are needed. Characters and stories are good though,Negative
"I gave this game a 4 because in the snow planet, I can't get past the boss! It is very annoying and I need help to beat the boss! So please help me defeat him.",Positive
"I can't play the gameplay properly because the screen is full of purple screen and black, i tried to switch to normal mode but it still didn't worked. Can you please fix this?",Negative
This look like everything I'd want in a game and then some. Hoyoverse really went and made games for both my favourite genres: open world action RPGs with Genshin and now with Star Rail a seemingly open world turn based RPG.,Positive
The game is awesome playing it since launch never been borede I was actually not a fan of turn based games but this one is so enjoyable and fun to play and also has better rewards now in this version 1.6 they're giving a free limited five star,Positive
"It's good... But after playing Genshin for so long... It feels weird playing this. This is my personal view, hope no one offended. I would have given a higher rating if the fights were like GI.",Negative
"A pretty good RTS experience, gives you just enough to learn and try out, and is quite rewarding to f2p if you save carefully.",Positive
Amazing! If you could play with friends though like genshin then it would also add to the amazingness of the game but overall it is amazing.,Positive
The game is good and I like it but I stopped playing because the game suddenly turned white like it had a bug? But honestly this game is very interesting and beautiful. I recommended this game to my friends and they loved it,Positive
"it's very interesting games indeed, but i can't play it well because of the bug and its always crashing since i log in the game. i hope it can be fix soon",Negative
I love this game because it works so good even on mobile graphics are amazing and the characters are beautiful and the music is amazing and the gameplay is very perfect,Positive
"Turn-based is pretty fun, story is good, music is kinda okay(some of them aren't my cup of tea). Overall it's a pretty much fun game to play, in a good way. Minus the gacha salt, of course lol",Positive
Really good turn based game! The only downsides for now are lack of content and high entry barrier for those who don't know anything about Honkai universe (me included) ü•≤,Positive
"Fav game ever. It's a turn based rpg game, and tbh, I didn't like it. I played many turned base rpg game and gradually I get bored. But somehow hsr is so fun that I can't stop playing it. Esp since mummy kafkas here. üòç",Positive
Amazing game as expected from hoyoverse though there are lot of bugs in the game right now. Hopefully believe that hoyoverse will fix them and enhance the game experience.,Positive
"Combat system is boring compare to other turn-based games, awful shield system. 0 creative lv-up system, it just copy paste from genshin at all. The only good in this game is art.",Negative
It's amazing game and the graphics are beautiful every characters have their very own style and the story line are unique I recommend you to install it and play it for sure ‚ú®üíó‚ú®,Positive
"An amazing Hoyoverse game. Game is beautiful, music is absolute fire, characters are very well designed. Gameplay is smooth and quite fun if you like JRPG's. It's f2p friendly as long as you go for waifus > Meta.",Positive
"Stupidest thing a game could do is the new events are locked behind the latest story chapter every single time. To make things worse, they removed daily tasks in battle pass and added stuff to weekly tasks..now instead of gaining little bit everyday, people should play hard in the weekends to get those stuff",Negative
Genshin impact - low graphics friendly can run at 4gb ram only but high on storage HSR - low ok storage but Not good for 4gb ram that's all it cannot run very smoothly on low end devices.,Negative
"I'd say this game is average, But the graphics and storyline is insane. And also farming equipments is also fun for me. Overall i love it!",Positive
"why i cant register new gmail? Im old player who want to play this game again with new gmail again but i cant register, it said connection failed but i can watch youtube or tiktok without any problem. Edit : i guess they already fix my problem, anyway thanks-!!",Positive
"I really love this game but the relic system is really not good, overall the character designs and world exploration and scenery is Good.",Positive
False advertisement I see on YouTube ads. Where is the 80 pool summon? This does not look good. I beat to the part where I can summon pool for units. But I don't see what they advertise on the 80 pool multi summon.,Negative
I'm having fun so far but I had only join because the many continuous ads of being able to do 80 summons if I start playing...I haven't summon a single thing after the mandatory summon...I have the ability to summon 20...I understand ads lie but yea 2 stars,Negative
"Great game, nice animation, world building, frame rate, and rpg. The only downside I can see in game is the lag.",Positive
"A game with Working Adult Time Friendly Game, good for busy bodies that have Life in Real World and just playing for stress relieving than stressing out grinding for unknown. Recommended for everyone who likes stories.",Positive
"Very good if you like gacha/rpg type games. Character upgrading & team building is fun, lots to do. Nice auto battle mode when you need to farm materials.",Positive
"Loving it, they give a lot of free pulls and the art, lore, script, music and characters are just stunning.",Positive
"I love this so muchhhhh, my only problem is that it's storage is slowly growing and we might be stuck with a situation like in genshin(which takes around 30gb of storage) TvT and as a mobile player I certainly cannot afford a phone js for video games",Positive
Dang it's been 12 HOURS! The loading is still there Not the resources The Thing when u like restart the game Like WHAT AM I EVEN WAITING I do not even recommend this app!,Negative
"This game is amazing, but not friendly to those who do not spend so much time on grinding... please never again you should make an enemy as difficult as that starcrusher swarm king üòÉ",Positive
I edited my review again you fixed the login errors but there's new bug the texture of building and floor are not rendering but the characters and npcs are fine please fix it on 1.2,Negative
"Amazing game, worth the hype and one of the best anime games in a while. With a unique turn based combat system.",Positive
"At last i can play the game. It's a good game play, good graphic, good voice. But the difficult level is a little bit too hard for me.",Positive
"Love the style, the characters, most of the music. Played Genshin but disliked the gameplay. Honkai Star Rail with turn based combat... it's love.",Positive
So far have 60 hours in this game and have not spent a dollar! Very generous game if you spend your resources wisely. Would definitely spend some money on a banner to support the game!,Positive
I like this a game a lot but the problem is when the cutscene my screen become crash and speakers is destroy. Please fix this..,Positive
"It give nice experience to the player story is good and characters ulimate skill have great animation , i just love playing this game and collect more awesome characters",Positive
Love this game. It has so much to do and is definitely part of my top 5 favorite mobile games. Can't wait for more stuff to be added so I can explore everything when it does.,Positive
"This games monetization is INCREDIBLY predatory and janky. I love the story and the characters and gameplay. However I can't in clear conscious leave a review higher than one star. The game is designed to manipulate you into giving them money in so many ways. What a shame, mobile developers need to realize this isnt sustainable.",Negative
"Great game, enjoyed playing it for awhile. Eventually dailies become too demanding/time consuming to be able to keep up with",Negative
"Honestly, Best gacha games so far. Good quality, Fantastic animation, Cool ost, and i would say overally unique game. Still not disappointed with mihoyo game yet... although my luck is pretty f*** in gacha games especially in genshin.",Positive
"Dont bother doing quest or trying to enjoy the story. LOTS of ad spoilers. Was recommending it to friends, now warning them to not play. Was going to try genshin impact....but I'm sure that will be spoiled too. Great game mechanics, but you won't get to enjoy the story whats so ever.",Negative
"I'm not sure if its my phone, but I do have a fairly powerful phone The android version is a bit jank, its tends to freeze a lot and cinematics stutter like crazy Otherwise, great gacha game",Positive
"error 1001_3. I play over 3 months, beat first planet arc, now I can't login at all, since yesterday. Reinstalled, verified. Love the game , can no longer play it.",Negative
"Everytime I want to open the game, the game crashes. Need to keep reopen for 3-5 times before I can play the game",Negative
"The new content has a Chinese opera singer right outside it so I can't have my audio on and enjoy the spooky vibes, because Chinese opera is OBJECTIVELY BAD by every standard. I shouldn't have to listen to what's basically nasally whining mixed with nails on a chalkboard every time I go to get a new quest. It's like someone is actively mocking the culture with how bad it sounds, but if there's one thing we learned from fake bopeep from GI it's that no, in fact the culture is TRASH!!! FREE TAIWAN",Negative
Good character design. That's all. Gameplay is boring. Good thing there is AUTO. Boring for a turn-based RPG. I'd rather play an Atelier game than this.,Negative
"unable to play, tried sign up and it would not continue even though i put in the verification code then it said the code expired, so i tried again and the screen went black, i exited out and reopened and its still a black screen",Negative
"A scam drop-rate game intended to milk your money. Unnecessarily long task with minimal rewards, crazily complex and unclear mapsÔºåand you are literally being required to run from corner to corner of the map just to increase your in-game time for a better statistic result of the developer. NOT recommanded, it's just a game without any decent thoughts but to milk your money and time.",Negative
"The game keeps crashing at this one cutscene with Red haired girl and Robot messenger thing that looks like a midget early on. Other than that, surprisingly fun despite the fanbase and unloading of textures with the collision staying. My favorite part was when Robin(Main Character who looks like Robin from Fire Emblem and has the same amount of rizz), Chrom(Dan), Red haired girl, and Trans-girl memory loss Astolfo(March 7th) defeated a Cosmic Threat called the Doomsday Machine around 2 hours in.",Negative
Is terrible I have just download it... And everytime I try to start the it's always glitch including the loading screen and everytime I start the game I always get kicked out.....üíÄ,Negative
I have this game on pc and I just really adore it!! The character designs are stunning and I really couldnt ask for anything moreee! I play genshin as well and I'd definitely recommend this game!,Positive
"it wont let me play in my old account ... i played hsr last febuary and quit from march uptill yesterday... when i logged into my account i couldnt play it cause on the screen said ""global network error check your internet connection and try again later"" but when i looked over to my brothers phone his was working just fine...we literally are connected to the same wifi,stopped playing in febuary and started yesterday the only diffrence is that mine did not work...:(",Negative
Every 10 sec make you move just to show you a unskippable cutscene. After the 2 min cutscene make you run 10 sec to find an enemy and get into a 2 min fight and after that end make you run 10 sec into an unskippable cutscene again...,Negative
You won't find a better free game. The amount of content and the quality is incredible. No endless grinding or pay wall.,Positive
Amazing graphics and immersive gameplay with a storyline to boot. Love that we can play on phones and on other platforms,Positive
the game is awesome and storyline and characters are nice as well. I wish you guys could have it on 120 FPS soon. I want to try that kind of gameplay on it.,Positive
"It gets so boring and so repetitive. Miss one event, you miss a lot of stuff. The game is super heavy with FoMo",Negative
Gameplay is good. Once you get higher in the ranks the materials needed to enhance become scarce so yeah. Good game but I dropped cause I got tired of barely getting any materials to enhance anyone,Negative
"The game is good.. but there is only one big problem. When i create a new account, and send a code from my Gmail. When i come back all the progress that i got had been removed.. It's just like a plain white",Negative
"Great game, i love the lore, puzzles graphics and character design i just hope they lessen those unnecessary items.",Positive
"I love that rhe developers think of what they can improve to the game, the thing im greatful of is the 180-240 Resin Increase. And mostly of the Free 10 Warps Every Patch, it really is worth it to spend in this game. Very Giving",Positive
Hokkai: Star Rail is a very challenging game for kids like me but it is very addicting and I like it and I found out about this game on an SMG4 video surprisingly but very good details and characters and I want to know what happend to the girls at the start of the game,Positive
From the past version to this version it's been good! Just needs a bit of optimization ü•∏ especially if there's too many fx appearing in battle. Kinda wish there was a turn off fx lol or reduce some fx cause it's making my battle lag üòî,Positive
I was in the middle of doing the 50 pull guarantee 5 star but when I was at 20 pulls it resset to 10 then when I got 10 more it disappeared without giving me a 5 star. Good game but that really disappointed me,Negative
"Overall the game is great, but sometimes in the story clips there still laggy, even though my phone has already meet the requirements to play this game.",Positive
I can't even load into the game but I have tried the PC version and it's mid. I don't play genshin but at least it can run on my phone which is why I'd prefer it over star rail,Negative
"terrible rate, has the same mechanic of Exos Heroes ( Exos did it better ), no skip, nothing new. Another failure and greedy product from this gaming company. Update: the game isn't working properly on android phones.",Negative
"I'm a new player to this game and I was promised 80 free summons when downloading. I never received those free summons, and I've made it to equilibrium level 1 already. the rating will go up when you guys make good on your false advertising.",Negative
"Really, really good game, has kids of content and is free to play friendly. I would like it if they made trace farming more efficient.",Positive
wayyyyyyy too demanding on your phone. I have last year's flagship Samsung and unless it is on minimum settings it overheats and I get FPS lag. it's very fun but clearly made for pc/console.,Negative
"Love the graphic and experience, the story line and plot were great and the character is quite balanced even for gacha game and it's has its unique style like mihoyo and hoyoverse game are quite nice .... Waiting for imaginary destruction Dan heng 5 star I really hope I can pull him",Positive
"All the updates they`ve done and events made me change my review. Now, this games story is interesting, resin is plentiful and the events are fun. One of the best mobile games imo.",Positive
"If you like turn-based games, this is one that I recommend. You can get by without the gacha(but it makes your life easier) and it is a pretty chill game.",Positive
"It's nice to play, but i have a problem with crash, something the background is glitching or the train is disappear.",Negative
Solid TRPG. Awesome experience. Smooth animations. Hopefully there's more end-game content. 4/5 for now. ||| Edit: They *are* adding more end-game content :) KEEP IT UP! 5-star game for sure ‚≠ê,Positive
Please make it more optimize.. Idk i run other hoyoverse game without problem but this game really made my phone explode.. I really love this game but need more optimization so anyone (actually me XD) can play without worry;),Negative
"Account got banned for security reason. Meaning don't take long doing captcha on loggin in, or play with slow internet cause it flags as security risk and they can ban the account, don't care for the player. Their CS after almost a week of me spamming them an email a day basically said sorry we can't do anything you're banned. Putting the time/money/effort in a game where CS can just ban you for no reason isn't worth it.",Negative
This game is awesome!! I love the depth to character builds and how all playable characters are valuable. The drop rates are decent unlike most games,Positive
I am having a login error since morning otherwise I would have given 5stars. Plis do something about it I can't login it's always showing error!ü•≤ Fix the login error plis I was playing few mins ago logged out and now I can't login it's been couple of times that happened to me now! Guess I'll take more of my Stars back developers doesn't even respond. The login error issue is annoying m quitting,Positive
"Keep doing what you guys are doing, adding amazing event and more endgame content plus new characters with different and unique abilities. I LOVE THIS GAME",Positive
Best open world games for android. No any negative points. I playing this game since it lanched in mobile. Everyday with new hope. And new updates are totally awesome. Really like it...,Positive
"The game is extremely good, but just one problem, the game sometimes force quit you in the middle of the fight.",Negative
"Overall are good though can you release more packs to buy or give more rewards to Nameless glory/medal pass?... The nameless glory/medal pass rewards are not worth it to buy considering 499 and 999... Also, can you release more packs more focusing for pulling on gatcha. Of course you should consider the reasonable price. Right now, the only one worth it to buy is the Express supply pass. If you release a package more focusing on pulling then I am sure myself I will buy it 2-3 a week",Positive
"after the recent update, the game would crash before i can enter the game. hopefully it's just a bug but i couldn't go in for the whole day after updating.",Negative
Gameplay is really fun but too much data consuming compare to Genshin and Honkai Impact 3rd . Hope that the amount of data consume will be reduced in the future. Edit: High data usage have fixed. 5 üåü from me,Positive
"Fps drops way to hard. Hsr are supposed to be for mobile players no? Then why does the game is this bad. The fps drops, everything else is good some dialogue is funny but the others is just a meh. Not just that they do a terrible jobs with the phone. My phone can handle genshin just fine but hsr? Not at all. I legit either got 0-1 fps per time. I hate this, i know that some of you are innocent but i can't believed this game will drops so freaking hard. I was so hype for this...",Negative
"Nice graphics, good Main story line, But Really 'Bad' fighting experience It's like card fight . It's really bring down the mood for game .",Negative
Turn based rpg I'd put on par with final fantasy 7 i was hoping for a new genshinimpact but what I got was way better story's amazing characters make. You bond with them love it 10/10,Positive
"Very very awesome graphics and was smooth on my phone. I like its story, gameplay and characters so far :>",Positive
Love the everything about the game honestly.... Only isssue I'm having why does every patches or updates do I have to download the game entirely it is quite annoying and bothersome.,Positive
"I like this game, i really do. But lately, the game can't run on my device. It crashed very often after a few minutes playing it",Negative
Help üò≠ I really love the game but I can't even play it properly. It works for like 5 minutes then it crashes. It's been 5 days and I still can't play,Negative
"the turn-base attack system is so annoying but good graphics, characters, gamplay and storyline can make the game more acceptable",Negative
"This game is fun to play and the game play is interesting, I like it and the story lines too I like playing this game ween I'm bored and it never fails to Entertain me over all really fun game to play so 5star. (Good job hoyoverse :> üëç)",Positive
"It is a very good game, it kind of the game that suitable for those who kinda busy on playing game. You can just let it autoplay while doing other thing. It is a good game.",Positive
Your ad lies about your 80 free pulls. It says download from this link and get but no so much bs you have to do to hopefully get them this is why I don't want to continue playing. I'm excited to try out a few different characters but lies right off the bat what are the odds.,Negative
"Wonderful experience with so much fun, usually not the biggest fan of turn-based games but Honkai Star Rail made it so much fun and it was familiar in many mechanics from Genshin Impact which made it easier to understand all the mechanics",Positive
"After new update 1.1 the game keep crashing at Login screen and forced restart my phone everytime, everything is fine till this latest update, and now i cant open the game at all.",Negative
Best game from Hoyoverse(in my opinion). Far better than Genshin impact or Honkai Impact and also turn-based side makes u to think rather than just spamming buttons which i find a lot more fun and entertaining tbh.,Positive
"Top ten reasons why March 7th is amazing.. starting with SATU!! she is cute. ‰∫å!! she is goofy. THREE!! her, dan Heng and the trailblazer are chaotic!! Âõõ!! great shielder in early gaem. ‰∫î!!!1 silly and goofy ÂÖ≠ÔºÅÔºÅ HAVE AN ICE DAY!! ‰∏É!! March 7th üîõüîù. ÂÖ´!!! she's the literal game icon of the game.

Where is my stuff why does it say my account doesn't exist when I updated my game and tried to log in it started me from the beginning with none of my characters this is ridiculous I put money into this game and now everything is gone I wouldn't have mind lost progress from the story mode but I put money in for some of these characters I had a kalfa clara and bailu I'm really trying not to freak out please how do I get my account back,Negative
"Can you PLEASE fakking tell me how big the ENTIRE patch is before I DL three smaller patches and then get a 3gb patch in the face. I DONT have unlimited data, if its big patches I have to do them at work which means I wasted 1.5gb for fakking NOTHING. Dont tell me its 400mb if its 4 fakking GIG. THANKS!!",Positive
"The fact that people gave the game one star because they spent money and didn't get the character they want is flabbergasted me. Tell me that you lot doesn't actually playing gacha game before, where you might get luck from few pulls, or need to reach soft / hard pity because you just get unlucky. Also, people that expect this game is ""Genshin"" style gameplay might want to stay away. It's turns based combat, don't complain and leaving *1 review because your incapability to understand the game",Positive
Hi.. I just want to make an suggestion about data.. Can you guys do the quests delete like Genshin Impact when the quest is complete you can delete it to save storage... If you guys doing this i just want to say thank youüòä‚ù§Ô∏è,Positive

"Edited: This game seem to decrease the bugs! I thank HSR for being super generous and super easy to grind... especially for our upcoming Dr. Ratio! I also thank this game for it's wonderful gameplay, lore and characters!",Positive
Great Game I guess. Gives good rates and same pity system as its other sibling game. I love the combat style of turn by turn.,Positive
"good rpg game, good story. but its generic tbh, big company and yet rates are STINGY as heck. same story with other games from company. low and i mean LOW RATES. I've been playing gacha games for a long time i know the joy of getting lucky but this just takes the cake. expect to roll every unit at SOFT pity of 75-85 pulls so save up. game is generic but the good kind, good waste of time but not money. i played genshin, honkai impact as well so i'm aware of the rates just overly disappointed",Negative
"good game, nice storyline, amazing characters. Overall, it is good to play but i don't know why i feel like there's something missing in this game üêß.. Hmmmmm maybe i prefer Genshin more. üíòüí¶",Positive
"Another hits for MiHoyo, for and old JRPG like turn based game always has a place in my heart so this game is for me perfect for my daily routine play. The gatcha is forgiving and can be done even for free player.",Positive
"I just wanna say congrats to HSR for winning different awards! I've been enjoying the game since August 2023. Good graphics, music, gameplay and gacha. The character designs are great.",Positive
I could give this a 5 star but guys you gotta fix the loading screen I keep getting stuck not the train one but the one where pompom walks something like that I'm stuck on the loading screen but I don't really wanna reinstall it again,Negative
(I Can't log in in my account it's always said error ) I love the game i love the story and everything but this error i play non stop to get blade and when wake up this what i found please admin fix this,Negative
I absolutely love the turn-base gameplay of this game. I also love the design of the characters as well and the story.,Positive
"it's been DAYS. it won't let me log in. it says ""error code: 1001"". I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING AND IT STILL WON'T LET ME PLAY. I'VE UNINSTALLED AND INSTALLED BACK THE GAME AND IT'S STILL THE SAME. I JUST WANNA PLAY. PLEASE.",Negative
"Great game and all. But, apparently it just boots me out. Tried downloading it a few times and it still boots me out. Needs better optimization for other mobile devices.",Negative
Captcha does not work! I tried 20 in a row and it failed each time. Also dark blue images go invisible against a black background.,Negative
Yea your game doesn't work. Endless train loading screen on a new OnePlus 10t with game performance mode on. Have tried reinstalling multiple times...,Negative
"It's a great game. And has stunning graphics ,and also open world.i prefer this game so much,and the characters are immersive and cool",Positive
"I changed my ratings because the lag, got fixed.And I want to request that honkai star rail to have a 24 FPS setting just like in genshin impact, so I can get a more smoother gameplay.because my phone can't really reach 30 fps",Negative
updating my review. I they have may lots of improvements since the release and the game has a lot more to do in end game and farming feels improved thanks to increased resin.,Positive
This is game is amazing! I just downloaded it and I'm already inlove! The graphics are very nice the story and everything is so good! I love Honkai and I hope it can develop more in the future.,Positive
"It crash I can't open it, it automatically turned off There's also problems with the audio This didn't happened with Genshin nor Honkai impact I'll be playing with this later",Negative
Really good. While the monetization isn't great. It's better than most mobile games and FAR better than Genshin Impact in some cases. Gameplay is really good.,Positive
"the game itself it's pretty good, but theres error when you're playing in mobile even you repeatidly restarting the game it's always saying error 1001_3....... please fix it:)",Positive
"hey, can you add feature that save set of relic on trailblazer? it was wasting time when i try to change the path trailblazer, and i must set again the relic and lightcone",Positive
"I don't know what they thinking when making turn based game with only 3 ways to attack your enemy literally can only do basic attack, 1 skill, and 1 ultimate",Negative
"Low option for free farming, it just get you 100 credit for every figh from map monster. Dont hv any choice for free to play player, F2p just need play for 20mins a days after u beat all quest and maps, and after that waiting for another 15 hour to grind your fuelfuel and wait for another next days. All in all if ur unlucky, u need 2 month for one chara to full build, with every single days u play. If u think it worth came and play with us.",Positive
After playing this game since release I think it's good the game is too generous and it's f2p friendly sometime it's boring cause you know this is turn based game it can be a bit boring but anyway it's good also my phone can't handle this game so I can only play it with my pcüíÄ,Positive
The game is very good but I do have one problem And it's the lag well my phone is indeed low end device but I'm still enjoying the game but due to lag the game continues crashing hope you fix this,Positive
"Bad story, powercreeping fast, money grabbing battle pass. Honkai copy. If u like the gameplay it's fun but the unskippable bad story is kinda mehhhh and time wasting. Prefer genshin much much more cause better narration.",Negative
"This game is not well optimize on my phone (xiaomi 12 pro with snapdragon 8 gen 1), unlike genshin that have open world map, this game create so much heat after only 5 minutes playing, i dont know how but thats what i feel, i play genshin for 1 hour my phone still on temperature that doesnt hurt my hand, i hope developer read my review and fix this problem",Negative
Nice game. I like playing this game. The characters is so beautiful. I hope this game can give the best update and try to put connections setting latter. That it. Overall the game is best.,Positive
It's nice n all but there's no customization options for personal looks. I don't want to have grey hair or be this white.,Negative
"It was Definitely the Best!!! I love how generous you are when giving Rewards also I hate you Uldan, The Quest are good although some of them requires brain it still fun, I still hate Uldan for those Quest, Mwaa",Positive
"The content is kinda lagging a bit, but the characters make up for it I guess. The gameplay could be more upgraded for a turn based rpg. But anyways I'd give it a solid 4",Positive
"Great game the free five star near the start is great,story is amazing and I'm really enjoying it and to those saying it doesn't run well expect that it's a hoyo game they normally are laggy for old phones",Positive

"Thank Honkai & Mihoyo to create such fantasy mobile game like this one. I'm Genshin Impact lover and i feel Honkai:Star Rail is best game in 2023. Hopefully, i can meet up this community of this game very soon and collaburate to make a content as well. I'll be keeping in touch with the latest news of this game! üòâüéäüôèüèª",Positive
"It's a beautiful looking game with funny dialogues, but for someone who played other Turn-Based RPGs like me, the combat is too simple.",Positive
"Great game, enjoyable turn based combat, grinding system isn't so painful, and the art is nice, big battery drainer, tho.",Positive
"This scratches that REALLY specific JRPG itch I get from time to time, where I NEED a turn-based battle system where you can see and manipulate the turn order.",Positive
WON'T LET ME ACCESS MY MAIL IN THE IN APP GAME TO CHECK FOR NOTICES AND REWARDS. YOU ARE INTENTIONALLY DOING THIS. FIX IT. I'LL CHANGE MY RATING ONCE THIS IS FIXED. I CAN ACCESS EVERYTHING BUT THE ACCOUNT CENTER AND THE NOTICES ICON.,Negative
Honestly the best game I have every played on a phone. Love everything about the game. The best thing is it's not pay to play. You can go very far without even a dollar spent 5 star for me %100,Positive
The game is very detailed and it very fun to play we also get a lot as beginners üëç the characters looks nice and detailed too,Positive
"I played this game since it's release and OMG it's so beautiful, the characters designs are good af, it's better because it's turn-based rpg and it's easy to farm!",Positive
It doesn't even get past the initial display of space rocks making the phone a useless potentially annoying noisemaker until app is stopped.,Negative
Can't log in and after changing my settings from medium to high it just crashes now. Cutscenes still lag on mobile. When is the PS5 version coming?,Negative
I really enjoy this game and it's very fun I hope there is a new place update because I like when the game is updated with beautiful and good graphics even though I can't jump I still enjoy it...i love it so much!! (‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶) üëçüëç‚ú®,Positive
"It's OK till you run out if quests, then it's just doing the same challenges every day to lvl up characters and whatever week long event that will take 5 mjnutes a day to do, which gets boring pretty fast",Negative
I love this game best music in beginning story line great and kind had to gride but hell worth it. Best game i ever played. Plus voice acting yessss finally something wont put me to sleep. Lol love it 5 stars. Love ice girl she funny.,Positive
"The music, the character design and animation, and the combat.... mihoyo, just drop a banger download it now!",Positive
Absolutely beautiful!!! Besides me losing my 50/50süò¢ the games graphics are nice and the characters are very detailed! Good job hoyoverse!,Positive
"Fun and in depth combat, Interesting and charming characters, and some seriously great world building. Would definitely recommend to any enjoyers of turn based RPGs or gacha games.",Positive
"Another solid game from hoyoverse, I personally enjoy genshin a bit more than this, I'd say genshin is the best mobile game, but this comes in second, really fun RPG turns game.",Positive
"like this game but there is an optimization problem, it often freezes on my device every ¬± 30 minutes playing. please fix",Positive
The game play and story is very well done but upgrading Characters gets confusing at times there is so much to do and it's laggy,Positive
"Best game just like genshin impact, and honkai impact 3rd. The music,graphics, battle system,lore,world building are best. Loocking forword for future updates .",Positive
my opinions: pros: -Intriguing lore and story plot -Good graphics and character models/design -Good music cons: -turn based battle takes a lot of time -battery drainer,Positive
It's a pretty game.. but the power creep is insane u can be lvl 40 and still struggle with lower lvl bosses doesn't feel like u power up at all getting really boring hiring a boss for ages,Negative
"Fun game, great graphics, great story, fun character with unique abillitys, getting 5 star characters are pain unless you have good rng or spend lots of money keep getting the same 5 star copy and not any new character unless 4 star",Positive
Newbie banner is rigged. It says that you can get a five star if you gacha 50 times. I got a five star on my 20th gacha. I continued to gacha. And after my 50 gacha I didn't get another 5 star. This is fine EXCEPT THEY DID NOT DECLARE THAT IT WAS EXCLUSIVE. If they were clear they would not let u continue to gacha thinking that u could get another 5 star and thus wasted my 30 pulls. It is not written in the termns and contracts. They are wasting pulls and cheating us! I want an explanation!,Negative
"Very fun game and i didnt even encounter any bugs while playing, although i do hope that they add a new currency to get trailblaze.",Positive
"Already a good game with a good story. Is there any possibility to adding general universal chat with other player? Also, i think adding guild and pvp menu will be great üòÇ Additional, please fix the lagging on movie animation",Positive
It always crashing even the first intro that's why I can't play it I tried to restart it again it won't work it always crashed,Negative
I love this game & would give it 5 stars but the game won't load for me for some reason now these past couple days. I sit on the loading screen for up to 5 minutes & still nothing jo matter what server I choose,Positive
Honkai star rail is fun but there's one thing that upsets me a bit like it always crashes at one point I'm not saying it's a big deal I'm just saying that it's kinda upsetting me.,Positive
I love this game..make me feel like in adventure..the way plot and story very good..im more and more waiting for next story..when the story can continue..,Positive
Talking sim 4... I have put in a few hours of playtime now and have had probably 20 mins of fighting. I understand that there may be a tutorial but even at the first train stop on the snow planet I got into 1 fight and talked for 15min. There is no way to skip dialog so you must sit there and listen to the terrible voice acting but oh yeah for some reason your character doesn't talk just kinda waves his/her arms around in a moment of awkward silence lol Devs are wannabe anime writers lmfao,Negative
The only difference I see from this game and genshien impact is that you have to pay for it and there's only a few different details like characters and stuff but other then that they game is really good!,Positive
Phone was heating up a bit fast so i lowered the resolution but then it crashed so now i cant play the game 'cause im stuck in the loading screen after logging in.,Negative
In my opinion this games design and concept is amazing as a genshin impact player it's nice to play another game thats really different yet still similar I'm happy with this game and hope for amazing future updates!!,Positive
Amazing graphics and great story so far i love this game but jumping option while exploring would be great.,Positive
"Please fix the login error,my internet is fine but every time I want to enter the game it shows login error..I really like this game.",Negative
"I'm really sorry man. I love turn-based games but this one is just not it. Apart from the character design and animation, there's nothing special to it.",Negative
"Laggy and choppy . Sometimes in between cutscenes the games just crashes itself ,sometimes screen just freezes .",Negative
"Game is good, though the turn based x open world is a new one to me but it works pretty well and the attention to detail is amazing, measuring up to Genshin",Positive
It's very fun but my problem is that the login error it's always popup on my screen and won't let me play the game...I hope you can fix this problem :),Positive
Thought it was an open world game because of videos. It is not you don't seem to have any control really over what you do. I played for over an hour and still waiting to get to do what I want.,Negative
It's an amazing game that respects your time. You can do your dailies in less than 10 minutes and consume your stamina with auto play. This is a great game that you don't have to use much free time on.,Positive
The gameplay and graphics are good really good but the game lacks of events unlike turn based rpg games I played before.,Positive
Optimize your fps please im using a decent phone with 6/128 heliog85 processor i play on lowest settings but it still lags unlike on Genshin Impact i play on medium graphics on 60 fps there are frequent lags but not much like in star rail i hope you optimize the graphics and fps thank you.,Negative
"Runs horribly and freezes nonstop. Black screens and reconnecting which respawns me, even though my connection is fine.",Negative
"i do not care whether it is good or bad but whenever i try playing it, i can't play because of the errors. it always says that to me and exit the app on it's own, im getting tired of it, and im furious. (Edited) Look I've been patient enough. I CAN'T ****** HANDLE THIS STUPID GAME ANY ******* MORE WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN ""Login error""!? I WANT TO **** SOMEONE RIGHT ****** NOW",Negative
"Wasn't charmed by it when it was announced, But when I played gawdamn this thing is great! Love the game! Edit: It's good but its got the same problem with Genshin, No Content",Negative
"It just me or not? Because whenever I'm trying to redownload the update, it doesn't saved my last downloaded. I have to restart the download update again and again. Please hoyoverse help me ü•≤",Negative
"Fun game, but there's no controller support and the touch controls aren't very good.",Negative
"Great game, designed for casual play, battle mechanics are surprisingly engaging, voice acting is quality, quick dailies. If only it wasn't mihoyo gacha rates lel",Positive
"This game is one of my favorites because of the fact that it's so waky, there is a scene where the mc can go into a hotel closet and create an entire new universe then decide if rooms sevece is a demon or not 10/10 would recommend",Positive
"I have an asia account and I live in eu, but everytime i want to wish, my screen crashes 1-2min, and ""the processing system isn't responding"" so i wait and after the bug i can see what ive summoned, pls fix it",Positive
"I'm hooked on Honkai Star Rail every since it released, the gacha rates for characters are less harsher than in Genshin (for me at least.) Also, I'm pretty sure in March 7th's skill, the devs gave her a pose as she did her skill (pointing at the screen with a wink) which referenced Kiana Kaslana from Honkai Impact 3rd. Thought that was pretty cool.",Positive
Worse experience with this game.. I can play until version 1.3.0 only. Devs didn't maintain device compatability. I spend $$ before now can't even play. Don't make an app with updates that's going to be incompatible to others. I had sent an objection about this.,Negative
"Everyone said this game was awesome, soo... i tried it! I did not regret it. I was blasted with adventure from my pc! I love this game and if your reading this, you will love it too!!üíõ",Positive
I really like the gameplay and the most exciting game I ever play is hsr it have a lot of rewards and easy to get the stellar jade. I'm so happy with it. Thanks hoyoverse,Positive
"Every time I enter the game during the loading screen there I immediately bounce from the game and it continues like that until I can't enter the game, Please Hoyoverse Fix bugs/errors in this game",Positive
"Love it so far!üíï I don't understand much since I've never played this kind of games before, but there's enough resources to get the idea üí° nice & accessible!",Positive
"Great story great gameplay, only problem is upgrading character is quite hard for FtoP player like me but overall very satisfied with the game and also the graphics is awesome",Positive
"very good game, turn based combat is top notch request tho, add romance (part where you can choose someone to be an eternal partner, tho just 1) would be happy if its added XD",Positive
Great game I love the gameplay love the graphics but it's always lags in the open screen I can't even see the train it's always the error why does hsr not working for me instead of genshin plss fix it now,Negative
All good and great! It need a bit more optimization when playing some cutscenes tho (the audio gets laggy!!!) üò≠,Positive
"I hate that it uses Genshin's system of gacha and gearing system rather than Honkai Impact 3rd's system. 50/50 is the worst decision ever done by Hoyo in their games, and relic system is so bs virtually makes players endlessly spend time to build anyone. Also the story comes every other patch is so stupid. Farming drop amount per stamina used ratio is also unbelieveably unbalanced and greedy. No other game is this costly just to max talent AND max level a single one of their characters.",Negative
Wouldn't load. Wouldn't start. Every time I touched my screen it said would you like to exit the game. You need to fix to would like to uninstall this faulty frustration riddled application?,Negative
"This game is okay. Graphics are good but the story is boring and a huge let down is the ""turn based"" fight.",Negative

"I like the game so far, but plsss hoyoverse fix the game cause it keeps on crashing even though i have a strong data connection its just wont let me enter the game plss i hope you fix this problem asap",Positive
"fine enough game, not really suited for mobile play. this was made to feel like an adventure, but liiike not something you would play for 5 minutes on the bus.",Negative
I couldn't even load up the game it stopped downloading the resourses when I was at 60% and it kept telling me to restart downloading the resourses but it wouldn't restart downloading the resourses,Negative
"This game is F2p-Friendly,turn-based,and has good graphics I would suggest to people to play hsr right now because of the stage of the game right now playing while the game is still in it's early stages guarantees great rewards",Positive
"I love this game it's so we'll made and the character designs are amazing, also the ultimate animations are awesome. Totally recommend it",Positive
"Played through prolog without issues, then game never worked again. Reinstalled 3 times, nada. Was fun while it lasted.",Negative

"When I'm gonna start the game, it say there's an error. I know my phone is Oppo A17 but can't you make it more compatible with another low processor.",Negative
"I love this game but can you fix when i want to change the quality,the place becomes white except for characters and enemies",Positive

"Playing this from silverwolf to fu xuan rn and frankly as much as it has way better quality of life than genshin, it's still a poorly designed game. It's bound to be repetitive overtime for sure and turn based games burnt-out faster than open world action fantasy like genshin",Negative
"The game was awesome but, after update just today the game become verry lag and lots of bug. What just happen? Please FIX THIS ISSUE because it is bothering my progress on this game.",Negative
It's like playing a console game going true mobile. Used to play a lot of console game wen I was a kid. Like playing final fantasy without random battle coz persona battle style is implemented,Positive
"The first 10 minutes feels really great but past 20 minutes is more of the same, nothing really memorable, plain p2w experience. Either you pay or you won't build a good character. This is completely my own honest opinion about this game.",Negative
"Another genshin but turn based, low gacha chance game to grab your money, the game is great with abit of minor problem but the chances of getting a 5 star feels harder to get than finding a needle in a haystack lol",Negative
Love the character designs and stories. As well as that the funny dialogue options we get to choose as the MC!,Positive
"I can't play this game, and by that I mean I actually can't play the game at all. I'm always stuck in the main menu, and I haven't played through the story yet because of the error code. I don't what's wrong because I tried everything to get rid of it. I even tried reinstalling the game and nothing worked. As much as I love to play this game, if I can't play it then what's the point of continuing to want to play this game. 1 star review.",Negative
Honkai: SR is a good game. It's polished (based on what I've seen) and the translations are solid. If you're looking for a good game to play on iOS or Android this is one I'd recommend.,Positive
It's great that it now has controller support but it kinda don't work with the Dualsense via Bluetooth.,Positive
"The games amazing and the characters are very nice, only the main reason of why i kinda don't like this game is because it's too big and my WiFi sucks, can't even get a vivid view ;)",Positive
"it has log in errors but it's ok my account is still there. The graphics are fine but it sometimes lag my loptop, my loptop is in great condition and definitely have big storage but it lags... why is that?",Positive
This game is fun to play with different things to enjoy and different character with ultimate move and characters style is also awesome please give it a try to play,Positive
Amazing turn based combat and amazing work of story's graphics with lots of content to do between main story updates runs smoothly on this phone,Positive
"It's amazing ! It has an interesting story , awesome looking characters , peak voice acting , nice gameplay , a lot of hilarious references and peak humor ! üî•",Positive
"No multiplayer of any kind, I was really looking forward towards a replacement to summoner wars, epic 7 but as good as this game is, its entirely single player.",Negative
Game is great. But please let us skip cutscenes. It's SO annoying having to sit through loads of dialogs,Positive
"At first I thought it would be similar to Genshin impact world but in Cyber form and battles would be with robots and all that, but this standing battle I don't like it. Thank God I didn't uninstalled Genshin impact. Will be continuing on Genshin impact.",Negative
"The game is ok,but the old school RPG style kinda bore me and I'll most likely uninstall the game due to how bad the rng of my account.. never once I won against the soft pity ...even TOF and genshin aren't this stingy with me..",Negative
To me I find this game good even the gacha is terrible still all free characters are good to use. Advice is do not go fast in game take your time to explore.,Positive
"One of the best gacha games, personally i find it more enjoyable and simple than genshin, the only problem it have is the lack of content, like im Level 61 and there's nothing i can do, just login everyday and do daily quests + spending trailblazer power",Positive
"I will only give 3 star because of the fact that this game, is very the same with genshin impact!!! All I want to emphasize that they're different game, so please make the content, the gacha system, the etc. Different.... Gosh!,!",Negative
"it was a good game, ngl. they only problem is i have to login 3 times before i got in to the game and that's what annoys me since i have a stable connection",Positive
"The first time I tried this, I didn't quite like it(for some reason idk)but after recently trying it a 2nd time, it really grew on me, very good game 2024 update:It only gets better as time goes on",Positive
Constant server problems. Using when using a lan cable the ping can reach 999 and often disrupts the game.,Negative
Overall Good Game Great Story So far And more coming The Turn Based is Fun as i have played 7ds pokemon and etc in my life and i get how it works Generous Start Free 80 pulls and a 5* in the first 50 (Same Gacha System as Genshin) The Characters are likeable The Dialogue is Really Funny And the Interactions aren't awkward Though my problem is just Genshin Runs Better Despite it Being an Open world game and this is just Area Based It runs 30 fps for me but i can run genshin to a steady 50+ fps,Positive
"Cocolia not playable and possibly killed too, plus you made Dan Heng 5Star playable despite having a 4Star copy of him already in which it's confusing and doesn't makes sense, plus the ""Trash"" jokes of the MC is not it really and just pure disgusting which is unfortunate, and let's not forget how the Male MC isn't the ""True and Real Main Character"" of the series too, a totally hit and well made game but for me at least, it has some complete miss as well like Genshin too...",Negative
I am Genshin Impact Player and When i heard about This Game i decided to Give it a try Since I liked Genshin Alot. i Thought i would hate it Bc of Turn Based Pvp BUT I actually Liked it Bc of how Good The game was. Story and mechanics... Everything was Perfect I couldn't Stop Playing It.,Positive
I love the character designs it is definitely like genshin impact but another version.I love the world and all of the ultimate animations.It is a great game,Positive
I was able to play this game smooth in 1.0 version but when 1.1 came out I experienced lag and glitch and now I can't play it anymore it so sad cause now I'm thinking to quit being trailblazer bye :(,Negative
"I love this game, but the problem is their is this glitch that makes the walls and floor disappear and flicker, I really hope they will fix that soon bc I think their are only a few people that have this glitch and no one actually makes a tutorial to fix this glitch I hope this will be fixed, but outside this glitch I have one thing to say, this game is amazing but I hope mihoyo is fixing this glitch, if this glitch is fixed I will be so happy and this is an amazing game",Positive
"Great game but as usual,the gacha pity are ridiculous,300 warps.Plus,the currency rewards are not much making reaching pity hard.Since this is a mobile game i expect nothing much,all the same concept. Edit:Make more hidden quest.I love it",Positive
"So far, this game is amazing. I actually like it better than Genshin. I love the battle style/system. Great story, very unique imo.",Positive
"One of the best game I ever played. Love the graphic and design, love the game mechanics, and the story.",Positive
"Hoyoverse only wants your money, don't be tempted on paying a few bucks for monthly pass cycle. You will only get 17 pulls in total and that's even not helpful since the pity is abysmal to the point you need more than 150 pulls for a hard pity.",Negative
"Can't even download the update without the game shutting off or hanging on me. I don't know why it's like this, my phone usually can handle high end games but this can't? How high end does this game want my phone to be??",Negative
Not a bad launch. Runs smooth on the s23 ultra. Turn based combat system like ff7 and similar gacha mechanics to genshin impact like separate characters and weapons banner.,Positive
No more update in quest and game process? It like the game developer never completely finish design the gameplay. And will get bore after 1 or 2 week. I start thinking of uninstall it,Negative
"Nice solo old turn based game with great graphic, motion, dub quality. F2P new player can get like 3 5* in about 1 week play.",Positive
"Tried downloading it for an hour and then tells me I don't have enough space. It's a phone game, why does it need more than 5 gigs??? I have over 10 gigs available",Negative
"I love this game when i play at my tab but why when i play in my fon it has a lot problem, first the loading screen lah the when it enter the game it lag again and it even out it self when in loading to enter the game make me mad,but my fon can download it fine. Pls i like this game pls fix the problem i like this game",Negative
I honestly enjoy the game so far as a new player but you guys got terrible i mean worst of the worst customer support Ive been having problems trying to log in I sent an email to you describing my issue literally 5 hours later no response I play other games and the latest they respond is an hour You guys are worst than my wifi company customer support I might stay online for 30 minute to an hour but atleast they get back to me I have better luck finding the solutions to my issue on google,Negative
The gameplay is great but its not optimised for redmi note 12 pro plus. Occasionally hanged especially when the story cgi appears.,Negative
I play this on my laptop and i was concerned because it was working fine before but after the update it gets stuck on the loading screen. Is there anyway to fix it?,Positive
"Amazing graphics, great storyline and characters, though I would like if Hoyoverse would add co-op just like in Genshin Impact, so it would be more fun.",Positive
"This is my first gacha game from Hoyo, I know HI3 but never play it. But anyway, like all the hoyo's game, hoyo make one of the best design characters and lore. So overall, love it.",Positive
"The game is overall good but i have a problem whenever i use some of my characters ult or maybe its because of argenti he's too handsome that my phone freezes, mind you this happens only when i fought argenti on his story quest.",Positive
"I'ma say this game is amazing, the characters are good, the turnbase move set works well, even when new characters comes out you got your chance, I say full 5 stars to this game this game is amazing",Positive
When i play the game at the loading screen the train was invisble and when i play it the background turn white could you fix it cause it keeps the game bug and crashing?,Negative
"My first turn based strategy game, and i am impressed, the only part i felt annoying were the repetitive and follow up side quests",Positive
"A very fun game üéÆ love the quality of the game, characters, quests, animation and more.",Positive
"***Please add android controller support*** The game is really fun, Im honestly enjoying myself, and the most I've even paid is $5 for that daily login, you can make friends with a potted plant, and discover other secrets I won't spoil.",Positive
Game is fun and I love all the characters and the storyline! ü§© looking forward to see more interesting things happening to the game!,Positive
Everyone is comparing Honkai to Genshin Impact already. But I feel if everything is the same it would make the game more boring. I personally love the way its set up. People need to understand different is good,Positive
"Really a best ever game so far, I liked the game play of each character and how smooth the game runs, the characters personality in game is just what I wanted !",Positive
"A breath of fresh air for someone stuck in FGO Hell. Great battle system, incredible OST and graphics.",Positive
"This game is everything genshin should be and more. The endgame of genshin impact is playing star rail. If you want a cool gatcha game that also respects you as a player, look no further.",Positive
"Love this, I have been playing since the starting of the release. It's really fun and I rlly enjoy it! I look forward to the future updates!!",Positive
"Even if I am losing 50-50 left and right , it is still an amazing game , much much better than genshin. The way devs support the player base is just amazing",Positive
The game was fine when I first download it.But recently it keep giving me error code.I try all the fixing method but still giving the error code.i hope you guys can fix this soon because I been waiting for this game,Negative
"The game is nice,but when i change another device(galaxy A12)to play the game i cant log in to the game.It always says 'Error,....' i cant log in to the game with this device (Galaxy A12) but my others device could.",Negative
"Really good app....awesome story, great graphics and f2p friendly. Doesn't force u to pull from every banner like most gacha games.....lots of planning and micro managing involved. Just wish they had a pvp mode also.",Positive
Still can't play it even with 128gb + 8ram. I literally don't get what's wrong. I newly bought this phone and there's nothing installed except HSR and I can't even play it.,Negative
"Loving turn-based games personally so it's right in my alley. But, the drop rate is really low and the gacha is really expensive.",Positive
"Great game. Loving it. However, I can not play it since the new update yesterday on my PS5. Please work out the bugs.",Positive
"I love this game, but after update i cant play normaly, it keeps glitching out. Please fix the bug.",Negative
"it's good to see honaki impact 3rd characters back but there's too much genshin factors in the game which makes the game less honkai vibe, i just don't feel there's any honkai factor is the game except for characters",Negative
Great game. I like it to be turned based. Has similar aspects from genshin like how to build your characters and elements.,Positive
Game is okay. Needs to make trailblazer power (energy) recharge time shorter or double to triple the rewards.,Positive
A great but buggy Most of the doors in my game didn't load so I got soft locked Great game but I wish I wouldn't get soft locked from a door (Edit: I have sent a thing in bug report and sent photo),Negative
It keeps saying log-in error. I don't think it's because my wi-fi bcs my wi-fi has strong connection. Pls fix this,Negative
"I literally love this game, characters too cute, the shy green furry girl I just love her style and voice, and battles just chiefs kiss. Keep up the good work star railüòÅ",Positive
"Love this game so far, some quests are great, some are okay. Characters are amazing. Never payed turn based games but I like it",Positive
"Don't make ads saying it's free pulls if u didn't realase all the free tickets at once. If you get support at early game, then good luck for never moving to higher lvl",Negative
This is by far one of the best games I have played with good animations and more but I think there should be more updates but I can understand how much the dev team have to do so that's why it's a 5 star,Positive
I didn't expect to love this so much! The story and characters are fun and the lore is really innovative. I'm looking forward to seeing where they go with it.,Positive
I don't play turn based type of games but this I will play all day nice graphics nice color schemes just an all around a good game.,Positive
"Have been playing this since its released , currently i love the lore , gameplay and characters as I will continue and always look forward for the storyline, thank you",Positive
"Quick reminder that the servers open on 26th April 10.00 UTC +8, don't give this game a 1 star just because you can't enter the game. The game is available for download now so that we can pre install resources and play the game when the server open immediately",Positive
Just amazing but please do something about the cutscenes sometimes they're very laggy even tho i have ram 8 samsung galaxy a54 and it's not an old phone and cutscenes are laggy sometimes even on low graphics please fix that,Positive
Horrible game to say the least. The whole game is basically one of those turn based card battle games. Story was horrible too.,Negative
"It's the Best game and I'm addicted to it Everysingle day, I didn't know I'll be Hooked to Turn based RPG HAHAHA and I Hope in the Future they will give us more Content and Exciting Questlines, Great Job miHoYo.",Positive
"Promised customization there is not. Main character is useless, ""Trial Character's"" are the only way to pass in the game unless you pay.",Negative
The best turn based RPG I have ever played on mobile. 500 words are not enough to describe everything I like about this game. Major Kudos to the developers!,Positive
Game stopped working after the patch. It wont launch no more and just black screens till it closes. Will change review when game works again. Edit it's been a week and still havent heard nothing and still cant play the game.,Negative
"I have a problem in this game so I tried to contact customer service, but customer service always takes a long time to respond especially since this is a new game so there's not much I can find in finding a solution. Please check your e-mail!",Negative
"I've been enjoying the game The story is interesting, the gameplay is easy to understand, the graphics of the game is amazing and beautiful",Positive
"The new update screwed over the game play, it was great at first but now I can't log in and play, I have to say I'm disappointed now and it would've gotten more stars if I could continue to play the game",Negative
"It's a great game and I like how they put the same amount of attention into 4 star characters as 5 star characters. Also, the splash art is great",Positive
"I am struggling to enjoy this game because I have no idea what is going on in the game's story. It's like this game expects me to know everything what is going in the story but I am completely clueless about the setting, world, characters and lore. The game isn't even explaining the story to me or what is going on. The game does an awful job introducing you and explaining you the world, lore, characters and setting to players who are new to the game.",Negative
"please stop spamming ads with sexual overtones and pretentious cute kid voices on youtube, I hate it! i hate anime. even though I have blocked and reported the ad still appears, very annoying!",Negative
I can't use my Backbone One with my Samsung S23 Ultra for Honkai: Star Rail. Apparently it's not compatible. Can you please have Android Users have compatibility with Backbone One?,Negative
Satisfying turn-based combat but the story is trite and pretentious. It's still one of the better gacha games out there.,Positive
RPG turned into a P2W contest... Graphically done right but that's about it on the positives. If you aren't planning to burn your hard earned money on digital waifus then this games not for you.,Negative
i played this game once when it started working and it was amazing although when i was logging back in it wasn't letting me it said error code so yeah I can't acces the game for now,Positive
"I dont even have to explain to be honest, compared to genshin impact it is much more easier to grind in. Sure it doesnt have co-op or open world but it's better.",Positive
"Love the game don't understand the hate, but man it have many technical issues, I guess that bound to happen definitely will play it over console than the phone",Positive
Uninspired and tired. Tutorial took forever and by time it was over I regretted every moment wasted in this unbelievably generic and bland game.,Negative
"I want to give it more stars, but it won't even let me in. It keeps showing a global distribution error?? At this point my interest in the game is gone.",Negative
Honkai Star Rail is a good game and I would rate it higher but when try updating it I lose by progress Genshin impact also has the problem.,Negative
I love it but can I request something? Can you please put a jump bottomüò≠‚úã and add co-op like genshin?. And let us chat our friends in the game too? I would appreciate it I really want to play and talk with my friends. :),Positive
"Much better than the last game , I just lost 50/50 on katzuah for the 3rd time and I uninstalled that one for good. This one way more balanced and engaging too...",Positive
Perfect game with a perfect team. They know how to appreciate their players by giving back to them. Other games should learn.,Positive
I I'm on mobile and I have been waiting for so long for it to start I can't see the downloading bar and I have been waiting for so long it won't work I uninstall it and download again but it didn't work I've been waiting for 50 minutes but it still doesn't work does my phone have glitch or it's just the game,Negative
I LOVE THIS GAME! Very funny but the characters and plot is awesome! I never really like turn based games but this is awesome!,Positive
"It's quite fun, as someone who has only really played this with very little Genshin knowledge, learning about the Honkai Impact 3 references later on really brings some fun lore to the game",Positive
"Solid fun game. Gacha rate is terrible tho, which takes away some fun. Also wayyy too much menu diving. Can't find what youre trying to do half the time.",Positive
I really like the game! Please don't stop putting humor even in the saddest scene cause that's what makes the game lovely. A humor filled games really makes the difference,Positive
"This Game Is Really Fun!! The Only Thing I DisLike Is The Glitching Out. Besides, I Cannot Stop Playing!!! I Play This All Day After School, And Before School! Once Again, This Game Is Awesome.",Positive
I like it's it's a beautiful and Everything good they gave you so many rewards and the style of characters was good no lags just one problem if u like play coop u can't but still good game,Positive
I'm paying for the monthly pass to get the extra stellar jade and haven't been able to log in for 3 days now. This recent update has completely destroyed the game,Negative
Fun and addictive. I Just completed the main story in just a week from starting the game. I'm looking forward to more content,Positive
"slow gacha chance, unfair boss fights (EXTRA ACTIONS), bullet-sponge elite enemies, stupid skill effectiveness for healers, break effect near useless, dumb auto AI, invented problems, advise on how to counter but forgot to include it in the game( Kafka domination), except beautiful graphics, soundtracks, everything else are pure annoyances.",Negative
"Im excite about this game but its keep on crashing on my phone, Genshin is fine and i play it well. Genshin has more data usage rather than this but it keep on crashing. üò¢",Negative
"If you like turn based RPGs this is the best you'll find on mobile, very engaging story, characters, and gameplay",Positive
"Great game! It's like playing a consule game on your phone. The art is beautiful. The story is interesting. Amazing job, devs!",Positive
"the game doesn't start after i download the game resources. after the propmt, ""the game will restart"", it get stucks on the loading screen.",Negative
the game is very generous! but it would be good if we can have a co-op experience. it doesn't drain my battery that fast too. and i like the playstyle,Positive
"Idk why but i keep have problem at opening screen, the screen keep to the left that i cant touch it to start the game.. even i restart my phone, the problem still same.. just stuck at opening screen.. pls fix this game üòî",Negative
Amazing game with great story and graphics. Cool characters and a console version is available as well.,Positive
"The log-on errors make the game annoying. Everytime I log in I always get log-in errors, hope y'all fix it",Negative
Combat system is meh compared to genshin impact. Turn-based combat is a little boring and slow-paced in my opinion.,Positive
Love the game ! (: Highly recommend. It's really fun . If you like genshin then you'll love this game too! The characters and everything are beautiful.,Positive
"I play almost 2 month For gift and resources (for gacha) is so nice ( I hope can get more resources for next contain) For system break,better make same system frome Freez system. For event I hope more event and more resource (gacha,material trace,exp)",Positive
I played this the other night and was only planning to give it a try to make an account after I am done with Genshin. Good graphics honestly ngl and the characters are sooo good,Positive
It's a great game honestly but your gacha system is robbing us as hard as genshin did on release and from all my spins I've come to realize you guys don't have a pity system set up yet you guys got some things to fix on this game and the biggest part of it is your money pinching tendencies,Negative
The game is great but when I log in back in to my account it keeps saying login failed I even turn of my DNS and Adguard but it still won't work,Negative
Mihoyo makes another gacha where it's $25 per 10 pull! Not worth it if you want to collect characters. However every other aspect of the game is fantastic!,Negative
"Generous rewards, so many endgame content, so many QoL improvements. Listening to player's feedback is much, much appreciated, thank you. Can't wait to experience 2.0 Penaconyüôè",Positive
Gameplay are satisfying but there's a problem. There's a lot of glitch while Im playing. I hope the next update will fix this problem. Thank you.,Negative
"i thought the game would be like tof or genshin but its a tactical game sheesh, the game was almost good the only bad thing is yeah its not my reference for the game which is tactical game and character doesnt know how to jump lol.",Negative
"Well Mihoyo has out done it again. Not your typical turn base game, it has mix features of Genshin and Honkai Impact 3rd. Addition to that the MC is mind blowing character. Good job on giving the MC a in depth highlight for an rpg.",Positive
"Just like the games that have been made by hoyoverse, this game is very fun and provides a very good playing experience, and with an interesting story every update",Positive
"Incredible Play turn base style game that I love, very strategic with customable characters and Great storyline.",Positive
"Yeah its good, its bad. Nah, this game was lit bro. I can buy myself flower. Its deserve 5 star. I just hope hoyoverse give many event for both banner. So, i dont feel empty. Not bored, but I feel empty. You know, the opposite of exist. Non-existence.",Positive
"Super repetitive Heavily time gated The game makes you rely on the battlepass for materials Pay2win game if you don't pay, then getting characters that are limited time is unlikely.",Negative
"Beautiful graphics, great story, and lots of characters. I am definitely enjoying this so far.",Positive
It's a great turn based RPG. It really scratches that itch for the old school final fantasy/Persona series of games on the go,Positive
i love turn based game and this game is amazing. truthfully i just return after taking a break from when it was lauched but this game still as amazing (aetherically) when it first lauched.,Positive
This game is amazing but I wish the story would continue to make the game more fun because I've already finished the current story and I really want there to be more of the story,Positive
"There's bug or glicth idk, I cant hit anything when fight enemies so i must relog and that wasting time so much. I just downloaded this game and i think i will uninstall soom",Negative
"Their adds force you to click 4 times to close them! Please start giving reviews to games regarding their ads as well, try to make them use ads in a fair way!",Negative
Character favoritism makes the game unbalanced and relic farming does not respect the player's time. The game does have high production values for what it's worth.,Negative
For now whenever I try to download the game its just stuck on pending but I feel like it will be a good game once I can play it and my rating is somewhat influenced by the other ratings which is why I think it will be a good game,Negative
"Always ""Game closing due to 3rd party app"". I could run other games such as HI3 and Genshin just fine and the game closing always in the middle of game. Wrong check??",Negative
"its mediocre, definitely needs some reworking on graphics, character design, and the fighting aspect",Negative
3 stars until you have Andriod Controller support :( I use the BackBone and would love to use it on this game :( Games fantastic! But need Backbone support!,Negative
So far it's a great game except for the fact the sound goes out from time to time. It's a little annoying but doesn't take away from the game to much.,Positive
"It's an awesome game but for some reason it reset my account? It's incredibly upsetting because I had gotten so far in the game, I really want to keep playing this game but I can't if my account is gone",Negative
please just let lightning lord attack when it has 10 stacks. it doesn't make sense for him to be so difficult to use and powercreeped compared to the other limited dps units.,Negative
"i love this game so much, the graphics(well it hurts when fighting because of the lights), and the stories is truly amazing, I'm excited to know more about March 7 *heart*heart*",Positive
"Literally the best turn based gacha game on playstore, and the best game ever by hoyo with that being said i felt even with 1.3 update we need more activity in the game for daily content (which reward stellar jade or at least tb power). All and all recommended",Positive
"pretty good,they do really better in script ui voice communication etc. Especially in aesthetic pictures,animations,and dynamic actions",Positive
Its a fine side game. Don't trust hoyo to be good stewards of your free time.. genshin endgame implies this one will likely never focus on anything you like and just be a wifu collector.,Positive
Very interesting storyline and the voiceline pretty nice and bgm is pretty solid to hear the gameplay is nice but sometimes has bug when fight and do some quest,Positive
"Pretty good, nice characters and areas, and music, but I prefer genshin impact playstyle overall pretty good game.",Positive
"The combat is actually pretty decent, but gets repetitive pretty quick. Other than that, this is just another gatcha game with 5-star waifus and himbos",Negative
I really want to download this. But my storage is gonna suck. Genshin impact was 49G. I honestly want to but won't if the download won't take a day and cost me a new phone. Love the character design tho!,Negative
I ve same problem with Yuuqi but in different area in past version I waited too long but can move or get out and sadly I left the game. Great game after all,Negative
It's absolutely a piece of art but as time goes on I don't think my broke self can afford a new phone as each time this game updates almost every 2-4 months...,Positive
I just don't understand why should you gave a thousand of trash relic and gave a really bad substats on it ? Just because we get the good relic doesn't mean the game will end right ? You still got a lot of story. Just stop being so weird on stats system. Not everybody have time to grinding all of their life in this game,Negative
Its really a great game. The battle is almost like a pokemon battle. This game also have a great graphics. I still like the main story.,Positive
"First time playing a turn based game, I would say that the story is amazing, the gameplay although sometimes feel repetitive",Positive
"I love the turn-based combat and the colors and liveliness of the characters and the game itself, it's never boring at all!",Positive
Game play and story are very good its just not very rewarding at all...needs more rewards so u can pull for more characters...maybe they want us to pay but I refuse,Negative
Very good game also very f2p friendly so you don't have to pull as much also relics are going to be very important when you hit trailblazer 5 n 6 also don't build to many dps that was my mistake.,Positive
"The game is very excellent, has good character design and story, and is very enjoyable events that give a lot of rewards",Positive
"I just lost my account with silver wolf e1! It was not hacked, I checked it from twin. But it says ""account or password error""! It is the same email and server idk what to do.",Negative
You should optimize the loading screen as it always crash there.I have more than 9 gb left after dowloading the in app so it is definitely your lobby needing optimization.,Negative
"Love this game! The graphics and animation is incredible! I originally played Genshin but it lagged to much, but this game is so enjoyable to play",Positive
"I don't like genshin but i like this one. Also pls add more grown up character, I don't want to be labeled as child predator while playing this game. Thank you",Positive
Great game and amazeing store but i would like to ask that it get controler suport so i can enjoy the game more i use a backbone and thought it would work with the play style of the game but sadly it dosen't so if u can plz give the players controler suport,Positive
"Another amazing game from HOYOVERSE!!! I love it so much, since it's play-style unlike Genshin and much more simple. Though it kinda lag sometimes",Positive
"Fun game, but theres a problem with the graphics. My game would randomly crash every 5 minutes, will you please fix?",Negative
Love the art and the characters ‚ù§Ô∏è The graphics are amazing! Looking forward to future events and characters :),Positive
There' s this new event in this game and now my game wouldn't load. There are no internet connection problems but the game is stuck in loading. Now I cant open it pls fix,Negative
"I absolutely love this game. When i started playing i got invested pretty quickly and i loved the story. One of the best rpgs ive played, i cannot stop playing.",Positive
"Fun game, but the rate to get a single copy of a character is terrible. Instead, you get terrible light cones 99 % of the time.",Positive
"this game has a lot of event, but they didn't make it everyone can get the reward. only the ""first achiever"" did, and they didn't make it clear the number for it.",Negative
"I thought this game was going to be bad but despise how long it took to download I really love the game, I remember I was playing it at 10 and now its 6, oh how quick time goes I really recommend this game!",Positive
"Can't be accessed using mobile data. What's the point of the mobile version, if you MUST have a stable wifi connection to play?",Negative
"I absolutely love this game, the characters, the design and the world's are so beautiful!! Honestly I literally love it I'm almost to rank 50 in the game! And I'm saving up for kafka (I LOVE KAFKA)",Positive
"Must have game if you love old school Final Fantasy. Great graphics, story and combat.",Positive
why do i need to watch and sit still when the enemies are attacking me? the fightings are not enjoyable at all. why do i NEED TO WAIT FOR THE ENEMIES' TURNS? but the graphic is pretty nice. üå∏üå∏üå∏üå∏,Negative
"The story, eventhough confusing with terms, is really good. The JRPG style is simple and eye catching.",Positive
"Getting Log in error 1001_2 tried all 4 servers America, Asia, Europe, tk server all can't enter will change my rating when this gets fixed until then it's staying at 1 star",Negative
I've been playing the game since launch not regretting it. Really good game with great graphics and story. Reminds me of old school turn-based rpg.,Positive
"After the update its not stable, min spec reauirement needed increase from 4/64 to 6/128. Oof gotta buy new phone, also they tsill havent fix high data usage 19 gb for simply playing the game for 36 hours",Negative
I loveeee the stories and characters so much but make the mistake of rushing it to the point I had nothing to do in the game rather just to wait for updatess ü•πü´∂üèª,Positive
I love the game and I love the gameplay but Every ad I see from this game the people tell the viewer that it has amazing graphics but when I first got Honkai Star Rail my graphics werent anygood as thrm since im on a phone,Positive
This game has improved the last few times I've been playing and I can say I am way happier with how the game is now and I will say this... Don't play on a Motorola because it will drain the battery fast.,Positive
Pretty decent despites the lack of content. I don't really mind it that much for now since it kinda fits my busy schedule.,Positive
Okay so i recently pulled a 5 star and it's Gepard and in some not so suspicious way the game needs to be rebooted and when I logged in he's not in my list of characters but the dust or whatchamacallit you get when you obtained a character is there,Negative
I LOVE ITTTTTT. so far i really love how the story going. i love turn base gameplay too since i've been playing game such as persona and legend of heroes.,Positive
This game is far better than Jenshin Impakt and way more f2p then Jenshin they already gave free 5 stat for appreciation but look at genshin best they can do is 3 extra pulls for appreciation; they straight up insulting tbh 3 pulls for playing the game for 3 years wow i recomment playing star rail u get lots of free stuff onlt this game feels like gaccha (jenshin shouldnt have put the category in gaccha if u cant even give a reward for appreciation disappointment is real,Positive
"A really nice game would rate 5 but the game keeps backing out recently, I don't know if it's my phone or the game but i've been having problems with it.",Positive
The game has good character designs amazing voice over and the gameplay and storyline is very enjoyable.,Positive
"It's a very enjoyable game, everything from the combat to the music and I'm confident that the story has a lot of potential going forward.",Positive
"Nothing to do after finishing both worlds, collecting all chests and all puzzles. Login for like 10 min a day to do dailies and use up trailblazer power, repeat.",Negative
"Great game so far, but it would be even better with Controller support, especially since you can play on Console already.",Negative
Cant login. everytime i check my email i exit the app for 3 seconds and it compleatly resets the login screen.,Negative
"I cant login until update 1.1 arrived, error 1001_3 constantly, try to switch airplane mode, changing to wifi connection, still cant login.",Negative
I love the characters and the story but the game keeps crashing everytime i play on my phone its getting alot annoying,Negative
I love this game but this game used a lot of data on my storage also every version upgrade was too big and its just a new banner coming up.,Negative
I love you so much Star Rail devs! Thank you for the constant QoL updates and rewards! And thank you so much for a free LIMITED 5 star character! I have not regretted playing this game at all,Positive
"I absolutely LOVE this game. It is phone friendly, amazing and unique characters, beautiful music. It is my new favorite game",Positive
"Amazing graphics and an overall enjoyable game. However, please add multiplayer as it is lonely playing alone.",Positive
Gave this game a try cause I heard some good about it. I was having fun until I got to the Doomsday Beast. The game itself kept closing out on me and sending me right back to my home screen on my phone. I got so frustrated that I uninstalled the game. Such a waste.,Negative
"Definitely overrated for sure. A turn-based game with Genshin-type banner and pity system, Genshin-type dupe system, and Genshin-type game with signature weapon system. Hiding characters full potential behind eidolon is just way too dirty for a PvE game like this. Can you play f2p? Sure, but would it be fun to use 4* units? Of course no. People doesnt get how greedy this devs by not putting any packs in shop. They do not even listen to their community. I hope for your success but its not for me.",Negative
Has more graphics options than its other games. It also has a nice engaging main storyline.,Positive
Why is HSR better than genshin? -Fun and rewarding gameplay -Have a lot of endgame content (unlike genshin who doesn't respect players' grind) -Respects your time (fast and little effort on daily missions) -Generous rewards (free 10 pulls each patch and lately they're giving away free limited 5 star character) -Able to craft custom relics with the desired main stats,Positive
- Much better than genshin - Quests are not too time consuming - good for casual gamers - Chill and not too pressuring - Characters are visually pleasing - Appreciate the auto-play feature,Positive
Haven't tried the game but looks good. The reason I haven't is because of the 9Gb file to download. Why can't it just be on the play store displayed.,Negative
I am not usually a fan of turn based games but the breath taking visuals and characters make up for it.,Positive
"Honestly a really enjoyable game, with appealing characters, interesting gameplay mechanics and generous rewards. Would highly recommend!",Positive
"Too much animation, giving me epilepsy attack. And no jump, lacks exploration. The gameplay sucks‚òπÔ∏è. Make it like genshin combat this game will boom.",Negative
"Hi, I wanted to say why did my whole data on honkai star rail restarted when i deleted the app then i installed it again but when i logged in i was back from the start i dont know how to fix this please help!",Positive
Amazing graphics shame you have to add turn base you could of had a great game but turn base is always turn off its boring and outdated come on do better,Negative
"It was fun when I played it first but later when I exited and came back in a few hours later it kept saying ""login error"" even when I came back the next day",Positive
"The account I used before is gone. Its connected to my google and then when I open my account its suddenly gone but the account is there, when I press my google it suddenly went to the first part of the game",Negative
It very good I had played it before and wanted to again but it always stopped at download resources and doesn't go any further so I was wondering how can it be fixed,Positive
"Would've been a 5* if there's an option to store the game (or any other Hoyo games) in SD Card for mobile. Would REALLY love to play Honkai Star Rail, Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact with my humble 64GB phone.",Positive
reaaally good! as expected of hoyoverse :3 the characters and especially the main story are super good! it's very fun to play you'll like this if you like persona series nyehehe ‚òÜÀô·µïÀô,Positive
Cut scenes are unskipable and there are lots of them that take ages so you have to listen through them all. 1 star until they add skip to all conversations,Negative
So much fun! I don't play many turn base games but this one has been the best I've played! Not a fan of the gacha but they do give you a lot of wishes so I don't mind it much.,Positive
"setiap mau login pasti ada tulisan error, padahal internet lancar2 aja and my phone were released in 2023 so it's compatible with such as heavy games like genshin etc. but when i tried this game, it's always say error or cannot logged in",Negative
"I love the game, first time in awhile I've been so obsessed with a game. Most days I can't wait for my workshift to end so I can log in for a few hours.",Positive
"Clear launch although had minor bug/visual bug and connection issue, overall best TRPG for mobile. AND IT'S FREEEEE",Positive
very F2P friendly interesting story excellent schedule for farming resources ( obviously better than genshin) i came to play HSR from playing genshin for more than a year this is absolutely better than genshin impact ( except graphics and open world exploration),Positive
"Your game sucks when run too long it makes lagged the game that's why it always keep crashing, you need to optimize your animation so that I give 5 stars",Negative
"Experience is really fun, honestly enjoying the game but it's love backbone support to make the moving and interactions easier",Positive
"Good game, i don't want to see lot many players moving around a place with weird dresses. Keep it up and don't make the main character mute",Positive
It is not working in my phone. Is it really like this or because I used the account on my computer also with my phone? This game is really good as long as you can play it.,Positive
"Rates are terrible, story isn't engaging. I also tried rerolling 5 times on separate accounts rolling more than 200 pulls and have not gotten a single 5 star besides the free beginner one at 50.",Negative
"The most recent update made the game crash everytime I try to log in, the textures won't load either, please fix soon",Negative
"This game is whole new experience. And feels gr8 to play. But for me, i dont like the battle actions, cause i prefer GI battle style",Positive
"I love the amazing graphic and songs! The characters details are unique, their voice lines suits their characters.",Positive
It's a very good game compared to genshin despite some patches being dry the game itself is really enjoyable and the story is impressive too they even added quality of life changes despite the game being pretty easy,Positive
There are some elements of turn based rpg missing here or maybe its in the future update i hope so because it will make the gameplay more diverse.overall great release and a good game,Positive
Games actually great and all but there is one problem after i go to play game i get this error message and i cant seem to take it off or stop this but i still had some actual fun.,Positive
The game has too much graphical issues and a bit laggy even on low settings can you fix that especially the svarog model is just black,Negative
Empty game. Main story takes 5 days to finish. Then you just farm upgrade items to level up heroes that you got nowhere to use because the game HAS NO CONTENT.,Negative
I absolutely love the details and the story of this game but the only problem is it lags ur phone when u use a skill it makes me annoyed about it Even after i got a new phone it would just lag it,Negative
"Fell asleep during the fights, sooooo slooooow and sooooo repetitive... The same motto with every skill is annoying after the 5th time. Probably not going to play much",Negative
"Please improve the mobile experience. Login errors and crashes. My phone runs genshin well, so i can't understand why it can't run this game",Negative
"I love this game!! I hope you'll give me Dan Heng on my American account! I've been farming for him lots haha. The game graphics is really smooth, I didn't even lag!",Positive
The game looks amazing and I wanna play it so badly but because of error 1001_3 I'm unable to login at all I have been trying since before global release the suggestions that support gave me did nothing at all,Negative
"My question here, the fighting had to be in turns? It's such a turn off, I thought it was going to have the same system as punishing gray raven or the other honkai game but no.",Negative
10 hours in the game in can say that it's a enjoyable ride. Cool turn based RPG with nice dialogues and an entertaining story. The characters are awesome (Waiting for Kafka! üòç),Positive
"I really Love the Quality and Realistic of the character they Design, The Place Ang Every Material in the game. I hope many more nation to added in the future and Character with unique names and design.",Positive
"Best game I've played from day 1 till now great character designs, amazing story, and not too hardcore, as a casual player that plays every now and then I appreciate it",Positive
"Doing my civic duty to try and counter the review bomb. The game's good. Some people probably dislike the similarities to Genshin, but IMO this feels like a dramatically more polished version of GI and I rather like that.",Positive
Love the game but biggest down side is my phone it's from 2019 and at best runs perfectly fine with max settings but at worst I can't move and have to reload the game,Positive
"So far it's good, even though splash screen produce black screen and not responding.",Positive
"If experience can tell me anything it is that this is more boring than office work and less entertaining than a terribly paced film from the 1990's, the ads don't do it any favours as well due to the fact all of them are mainly cut off before the people even finish their sentences so that they can be unskippable ads on YT, they are so many things here that could be done 100x better, especially with Mihoyo having an apparent 7 billion in total assets ü§°ü§°ü§°",Negative
"I'm loving this game, i love the turn base games i grew up with.But the reason I give it a 4 start is that it's not FTP friendly.My opinion could change in the future.",Positive
I can't enter the game after downloading it because Error Code:1001_1 I searched it in Google it says to turn off my adblocker so I turn it off but it still couldn't work it still says Error Code:1001_3 now,Negative
great game. very addicting and very f2p friendly. don't expect the game to run well for you if you haven't upgraded your phone since 2015 üíÄüíÄüíÄ,Positive
Amazing game but those annoying purple boxes. Are the supposed to be their or is it a glitch? Anyway your game is amazing! Great artwork.,Positive
"The game performance is like genshin impact, it lags a lot on my device...That's why I can't play it...I hope one day developers improve the performance of their games.",Negative
"I cooled off my phone by placing it atop an ice cube Decent game, good graphics, but I feel like I'll get burnt out quickly. Similar to other Hoyoverse games",Negative
"IMO one of the best turn based games BY FAR on android! why is dat so? BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME OF THE OLD FF GAMES AND TALES OF SERIES! Hoyoverse really found a way to make a really good ""console"" game onto an android platform kudos to them!",Positive
"Amazing! From animation to visuals and stories it's overall great, I can't wait for more updates to come to this game",Positive
"Uable to progress MAIN STORY without farming in artifact casino every day, and not even for characters you like, u are forced to progress every character the game throws at you, or u hit a boss in story you cant pass",Negative
"So fun and satisfying/rewarding, I like to play it at school a lot. Still works for me even with horrible wifi while I'm there.",Positive
Pay to win can't even get past the basic content without pain The amount of materials you get super grind fest and the new event they put automatically to the highest level possible so makes it impossible for new players to play it....,Negative
It is a good game and I'm having fun with it. Good story. But I hope that you can change your team in before enemy engagement in story.,Positive
"Story, Gameplay, Music, Humor it's all perfect and well excuted. No bugs on launch day.",Positive
"Fantastic game, maybe the most impressive on mobile. But the current version is 14GB!!!! So I had to delete it.",Positive
"beautiful graphic and obviously the character, but if there is a features to play together with friends it would be cool",Positive
"Very Very Good Excellent like no word is discribing this game but one very bad thing each time I start a new account genshin or star rail I always lose the first 50/50 , bruh I lost to bronya on seele please help",Positive
"So far great game and beautiful graphics! Like the turn based combat, one of my favorite.",Positive
Gathering any usable gear on this game is awful. You're subjected to too much RNG spending weeks or even month for a decent gear piece for a single character.,Negative
"a meme in the guise of an RPG... I love it. all the meme references and the characters are amazing, and the graphics are just as nice. 10/10.",Positive
"I'll do it 5 when i have soft pity for the first time. i always get the hard one in every single hoyoverse game, not about ""luck"" but my acc really get haunted by hard and losing 50/50 all the time.",Negative
I have been playing this game since it's release and never had any issue playing but since yesterday my game isn't starting It crashes right after I click the game icon.,Positive
"So many glitches and lag eventhough I have the very low graphics. The screen blinks with green, orange, etc.",Negative
"Amazing game, great as free to play, and with the inexpensive monthly purchase. Great story, and gameplay.",Positive
"The characters are beautiful and well written, as well as the story. Hoyoverse decided to be quite generous in this game üòÖ highly recommended!",Positive
I like genshin Ang honkai star rail so much but this game is a lot easier pls don't make it harder and thank you for making my life more easier the way it gets starlight cores is so good so much thankful for hoyoverse most likely they release bladieeeeee,Positive
"My first impression of this game, this game is very have heavy movement... Not like genshin very fast and optimal time... I hope you can Consider the slow movement",Positive
Terrible QoL for a new gacha game. Unskipable cutscenes and rerolling is near impossible. Also the rates aren't great either. Animations and characters look good but nothing outstanding.,Negative
"One of the worst ""casual"" games in existence, it advertisis itself as a casual game but the existence of ""momory of Chaos"" makes that untrue. If you are looking for a casual game that helps you relax this isn't it. You have to spend 4 to 5 months grinding just to enjoy basic stuff.",Negative
"After i closed the game my phone lags a lot and sometimes it restarts, this happens to me often. By the way the game is excellent",Positive
"The graphics, animation, characters design, story are all amazing, no complaints here for me.",Positive
Game is great overall but somehow in cutscenes my device is able to perfectly render everything yet the sound is corrupted/lagging overall great game 7.8/10,Positive
Would be 5 stars if you could skip excessive in-game chat & cutscenes. The characters ramble on and on waaaaay too much. -__-,Positive
"The best games and graphic and stories are good , World Adventures Best Characters and more characters coming and Event .",Positive
The game is phenomenal....I wish the best for the team and hope the pacing is kept this way for the improvment and updates...enjoying a lot...thank u team,Positive
"Game is awesome beautiful animated characters, good story. It's a trun base rpg, and a gacha hopefully power creep isn't to bad but wil have to wait and see",Positive
"This game has blown my mind and filled the void of a lack of decent turn based rpg games. Easy to learn, hard to master.",Positive
"Probably the best turn based game for mobile. Grind is nice, team composition is easy to understand. I think I'm going to play this game in a long time",Positive
I'm totally lost is what I'm supposed to do it doesn't even look like a game it's just sitting there I haven't seen any characters all I see is a planet and something kind of piece of equipment I can't tell,Negative
"I really love Starrail but for some reason when i try to open the game recently it just crashes instantly, im not too sure whats going on, i have it updated",Positive
Hoyoverse needs to stop shoving anime ads down my throat because there so damn annoying. And the game is extremely bad. Turnbased games are fine but this is horrible,Negative
"I'm going with not less than 5 stars. Gorgeous game, neat gameplay and storyline, you can easily f2p. Thanks for the ride !",Positive
"Launching the game always takes several tries, it keeps saying error, and now it stuck on log in screen.",Negative
"I am impressed, everything is very polished, eventho the every element itself isnt that new, but i appreciate all the efforts theyre pouring into this game.",Positive
"since the silver wolf updste, the game crashes everytime i entered a fight. hoping for an optimization for low end chipset phones.",Negative
"The game is good overall character game paly,but I have problem after playing for like 30 minutes game start lagging and after while it's crashed",Positive
"Good game, solid combat. Easy to pick up and set down. Plenty of content on the game and that will comeout.",Positive
Honest review the storyline is boring and no improvement + u nee to farm item and after farm it need to farm again to level it up and after level them up and get trash stats need to farm again so much time consuming and boring overall -100/100 Goodbye trashy game,Negative
The game is fun but after the 1.1 update the game wont load properly the entire map is gone only the enemies can be seen please fix this issue,Negative
Fun but challenging. It is like other rpg in which if you want to be the best you have to pay. Doesn't completely lock out f2p tho.,Positive
"I love this game. It's perfect. Everything that was missing in genshin before, it's in this game. Keep up the good work and keep giving us players a fun experience. Thank you.",Positive
"I recommend this game to everyone. Story is on point, graphics and side quests are great. Best mobile game on the market",Positive
"Please!!, fix the login it keep saying ""too many request, please try again later"" it started yesterday and still happens now please fix it i can't play the game.",Negative
"really great game,If it wasn't for the fact it doesnt really teach you how to level up, I say Genshin is better at tutorials, Star rail is better at Quality",Positive
To much login errors...it was all good at start but now it just bugs with me while entering the game.. doesn't happens with other hoyoverse games...,Negative
All the character's eng voices are soo bad. (so forced. stop talking pls) Gameplay so slow and boring. animation kinda choppy and ugly and bad. Vidyadhara better>>> Co op isn't an option (i get the feeling you're projecting cuz you're lonely and praying on everyone else's loneliness) ps. praying for your mental health and well-being.üòáget better,Negative
"It is a great game, but i do reccomend playing it on a computer, the experience will be smoother.",Positive
It stopped working. It closes before it reach the game. Please fix. Only can access loading screen.,Negative
It actually pretty good üëç for my 1st turn base game experience.but pretty hard to clear some Boss fight for early game gonna use my brain üß† on skill and heal turn,Positive
I wanted to play this game....but whenever I open it up....it shows loging error......which is so irritating.....can you fix this....as soon as possible......,Negative
"Decent enough. Not much to do, combat is so simple that the agency given to players within a fight is tiny. Story is top tier until you leave the 1st planet (jarilo-4) and arrive on the luofu then takes a massive nosedive.",Negative
"Hoyo, please help me!!! Everytime i tried to log in, there's a notif saying login error. I've tried to reinstall and it's stille the same. Thankyou!",Negative
"Really really amazing. GORGEOUS. Some people said ""Ah, it's turn base game, IT'S BOOORING. I prefer Genshin than Star Rail"". But I don't think so. So, If Hoyoverse make a same game with Genshin, You will be dumb. Imagine there are 2 Genshin. So why don't you try the new version?",Positive
Pls undate put the low details button in the settings because went I play it so lag and hard to play pls fix this and I try to play on this phone but I can't so I play oh my second phone pls fix this bug aswell I like the hardworking on the game and pls help me pls,Negative
"The story, the characters, the amazing voice acting.... hoyoverse killed it with this game and I cannot wait to see what happens next",Positive
"Always login error. Every time I report about login errors, the customer service always says turn off DNS even though I never turn it on..",Negative
"Game is good, plenty of story, plenty of optional grind. Kinda p2w but there are far more opportunities to get banner rolls compared to genshin.",Positive
"Cannot register account for the multiple and it's always saying ""request failed the current network environment is at risk"" please I hope this issue will be fixed in the future",Negative
"LOVE THE FAME I'll be waiting for more upcomong updates but I wish we have the controls such as jump,glide,swim and climb tho but it's really really good :3",Positive
"So far so good, since it's still new game the memory still suffice. I played by a phone 6gb RAM and still run smoothly. Good.",Positive
"Hello hoyo! I just wanna tell to the people that hsr is not the favorite gacha game of hoyoverse, ofc you will cuz they gave away free 5* character but they got a lot of achievement to the game so many times that's why they giving away free character üòê I'm still enjoying playing this game!!",Positive
I was gonna put 5 star but im having a bug right now where I teleport to astral express for the mission An Invitation Without Proffer. But when i try to teleport to other place it wont let me. Please Helpüò¢,Negative
"this game was good but i didn't get my pre registration reward which make me sad,i mean i pre registrate and waited for a month and didn't get nothing.. please if it's really problem.. fix it..",Negative
Gacha gotcha. Horrible rates. $200 ain't enough to guarantee you who you want. Well I've played Genshin and HI so I figured I'd try this as well. Definitely my favorite of them (partly because it runs way better than Genshin). Absolutely gorgeous game.,Negative
Can't even play on my realme GT Master. Stuck on the train after downloading. So far when i play genshin impact at this phone didn't have any problem. Don't know what happen w this game,Negative
"Love the story, characters and game mechanics. My only complain is that we don't have our own cabin on the Astral Express.",Positive
One of the best gacha though the story is not complete. A mix of genshin n HI3rd. People re facing many bug n complaining but I am not facing any.,Positive
"love it, grat map, easy to understand, good music. but the puzzle is too easy.",Positive
"I'm a fan of Honkai impact 3rd and Genshin Impact. Honkai Star Rail is a Awesome Anime game! But Please fix the Connect of the game, The wifi is good. üëçüèª Overall Awesome Game 5 out of 5 Stars. üåü ü§©",Positive
"i really love the game, dont get me wrong. it's just that every version for pre-install has WAY bigger storage taken than pre-install genshin. (6.7gb) eerr ü´•",Negative
"Fun game, all characters are viable till near end game, then u gotta focus more on single target dps. Very F2P friendly, short story but fun dialogue",Positive
I love this game but something that I fear that the game will be boring in the future and take a long time to make new content and worlds that we can explore,Positive
Everything was great but disappointed when I tried fighting. I was disappointed when I knew that it was an strategy game it makes me not happy.,Negative
"I really love this game, but the only lack is this game was using too much battery. Eventhough Im using xiaomi 11t pro and had 5000 mah. Only using medium graphic and for others but stillu battery draining so fast",Positive
Can't play the game... Keep getting 1001_2 error code but my friend who has the same phone can play without issue. I tried logging with just my Mihoyo account and still no change,Negative
"Haven't spent a dime yet, several hours in. I've enjoyed the story and graphics. Game play is turn based and comfy.",Positive
"Genshin alike, but with different gameplay and mechanics. Great graphic quality Great music Great turn based gameplay",Positive
Fantastic music. Super full world. A lot of story and side quest. Feels like a AAA title.,Positive
8-12 hours play time and you have finished the whole main story. Summoning new units is stupidly expensive and you can spent your whole daily energy in less than 5minutes.,Negative
It's a pretty fun game with very good graphics but since I have installed this game I can play when I want to log in they say there's an issue 1001-3 so I can't log in,Negative
"I still don't get to play it because everytime I tried to log in it kept kicking me out of the game it says ""error occured please try again later code 1002""",Negative
"Too much grind, story line was not attentive, rate of pulling good unit was rock bottom, fix these 3 major issues first then we'll see.",Negative
don't listen to these genshin dumbs. idiots have no clue that devs teams are completely different. Star Rail is amazing. Characters are amazing. Story is amazing. And rewards are amazing! I love this game with all my heart. fk genshin and its deranged community,Positive
"Typical gacha game. Don't believe the reviews. Generous? Ok, you get a guaranteed 5* from standard banner on 1st 40 pulls. The ""weapon banner"" is better than Genshin. That's it. After the honeymoon, log-in reward phase dries up, so do the rewards and the grind begins. It's more beneficial to just open your trashcan and throw your money away. Mobile gaming is just pure greed. Played on PS5... Persona 5 or Soul Hackers 2 are better in every way, plus, you get over 100 demons to play for only $60.",Negative
"After I downloaded and installed the game, it wouldn't start. It always takes back to the homescreen that says ""log in error"" but I'm actually using the same email and password I use for Genshin when I registered for Honkai.",Negative
This game is so much fun i love this game the character designs are amazing and the voice acting are perfect the story is amazing the turn base gameplay is nice,Positive
Been love with this game since the first time i downloaded it The story is really amazing and quite deep It wont take long to master the game's mechanic as u progress through the game There is also no bad characters in this game,Positive
Great game. No ads. Good story line and animation. Good characters to play as well.,Positive
Long tutorial. No rerolls unless you wanna go through 40mins of tutorial which is boring by the way. RPG turn based game.,Negative
This is probably one of the best turned based type of game I have ever liked! I'm expecting great results later on in-game as well. I hope Hoyoverse will make more wonderful games!,Positive
"So far it was a killer Turn-Based CRPG (Chinese RolePlaying Game), but soon after like in Genshin, it'll forced you to pay Armored Core money for a 5-Star Character but thank goodness compared to Genshin, the rewards are forgivable.",Negative
"I liked the free ten pulls every update, and the fact that they dropped a free 5-star character in 1.6 (this update), I can't wait for the next update, thank you hsr!! ü§≠‚≠ê",Positive
Great game very f2p friendly And they give us some rewards but the problem is everytime I battle like I can't attack them I have to get ambushed or something and every time I get ambushed my team will die instantly even it's full hp,Positive
Everything about this game is good but i m having a problem where my data consumption is too much like it is consuming 200MB in 5 mins. Can anyone please help me with this?,Negative
"I love the game! Getting currency to pull for the gacha is really easy to get, and I love how it's super easy to get 5* characters (at least for me)",Positive
I love the fact that this game doesn't take that much space than the other Hoyoverse games I've played! And I love the space ambience.,Positive
"Was only able to play it for a bit, phone's processor got really hot playing it, couldn't risk it. Really fun while it lasted tho",Positive
I'm truly loving the game but unfortunately for those of us who won't be able to keep up with the storage much like Genshin then we will have to leave on the next update after the next which sucks since this game is amazing,Positive
"It is creating a standard for turn-based RPG games üíñ with the best characters from Honkai Impact 3rd, especially how they have Himeko Sensei ü•∫ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è I have nothing but praises for this ‚ú® but i would still appreciate some free gifts of stellar jades or warp tickets üåöüíú",Positive
Game is polished (as expected) but sluggish rates. Genshin had a really fun gameplay to compensate it but star rails gameplay is to boring for me. Also hard to reroll...,Negative
I'm impressed by the depths of the characters and the the intriguing story. I haven't been into a game since the xenosaga era:(,Positive
"Need more voice lines in battle, it gets boring listening to the same voice lines over and over again. I just mute the game while battling.",Negative

"Wonderful, it's similar to GI in some ways and HI3rd in some other ways. Story is interesting, character design is amazing. Luv u Selee, March.",Positive
"1.6 update delivered not only new contents,but also unspeakable frame/lagging issue. I think it's the update's problem since my other games run smoothly and this game also run with 0 lags before the update.",Negative
Takes to long to load on updates and takes up to much storage on the phone I was really enjoying the game but it's not worth the long loads and storage for me so had to uninstall unfortunately,Negative
"Alright alright I'll give 5 stars on every hoyoverse game. keep up the quality of the game, and don't let us down. Oh, a copy of honkai impact 3 character, why not? At least they give me Himeko.",Positive
"Why i can't login the game, it says login error please try again later. How many again you want me to try. If it just a bug please fix it immediately.",Positive

"It's a good and fun game but nowadays It's been pretty crashy and I wish somehow u can add a co op system just like in genshin, it could've been fun with friends",Positive
"The game is good very supportive to F2P adventures , wild imagination , fighting style is stunned I love it so much, Getting character arent hard if you patient and keep your Jade without seeing PomPom in every pull XD",Positive
The new update keeps crashing my game at start up. Says patch running and shuts off otherwise would be 5 stars,Positive
it was really good But i leave it for about a few months and when I came back I open the app and it exits automatically I can't even play I'm considering on Deleting honkai starail because of this so please fix this. Update; I deleted it and Download it again and I'm wasting all of my data to this stupid game,Negative
I love this game became obsessed when I had my gcse so maybe don't play this game if you have tests coming up and stuff but over I love itttt but it kinda gets boring if theres nothing to do like no quests or stories to do,Positive
If I see that ad about the new character one more time before a YouTube video I'm going to lose my mind. Anyways I've played it on PC. The gameplay is alright.,Negative
I can't even get past the ready screen it keeps on guvving me an error and i tried everything and it still doesn't work this is n very disappointing was excited for the game now it won't work,Negative
"I like this game, but, if there is an update again that literally takes 13GB+ my hsr career will be stopped i have no room again for temporarily downloading 13GB+ and wait for the game to clean the old data",Positive
"Loving it since the beginning it came out, just have small lag spikes on PC is all the problem I see. Now TL 65. Just hoping to get Bronya still since she's my fav since 3rd",Positive
It has a lot of features that wasn't in Genshin Impact and I love the humor in the game. It's really fun to play and immerse yourself as the main character!,Positive
The game is fun but please optimized the loading screen for the mobile phones that doesn't meet the recommended requirements like mine.,Negative
"Everything is fine, but they're missing iconic enemies from honkai impact like Joyo ninja, Deathless Doom, Litch, Archer and other enemies. Hope they include more variety of non robotic enemies soon",Negative
"What features this game gets right, over Genshin Impact includes: dark loading screens, so it doesn't blind you; and there is a feature to lower the zoom sensitivity, which is great for mobile players. Thank you Star Rail developers. Now can you help out the Genshin developers please?",Positive
"I love this game a lot, but I didn't expect that I would get my free 80 summons. WHERES MY FREE 80 SUMMONS, I was promised on a tiktok video that I would be given 80 free summons for installing the game.",Negative
"Star Rail is mint! Most amazing next generation graphics and story, this is what games should look like on console or pc. Definitely triple AAA!!!",Positive
Not a fan. I'm playing genshin impact. I thought the characters were bland and come on with silver wolf.?. I thought some elements were extremely cool and some people might like this,Negative
"this game rocks bro, whether you like fantasy or sci fi this game has it all, they even got a roguelike and pokemon mode. very generous gacha system too, very similar to genshin's gacha system but better in some areas",Positive
"Gacha rates may be painful but characters, story, art/music and strategic gameplay make for a great experience. Plz send me more money and jade so I can become all powerful and grant Clara some shoes.",Positive
"Hi Hoyoverse! Today I was playing Honkai:star rail as usual but suddenly my character stuck under the parlor car and can't get out because I'm doing a quest, I think this is a bug... Can you pls fox this tysm",Positive
"It's really good but the only problem for me is when the characters ult, it's too bright or is it just me. But everything is good. 5 star still :)",Positive
"Honestly love this game, love the voice acting and characters as well as the stylised bursts. 8.5/10, I'd give it a play!",Positive
I don't often rate apps 5 stars but this one definitely deserves it. What a superbly made game. This mobile title can put some dedicated AAA games to shame!,Positive
"This game is soooo good so far. This is the first Hoyoverse game I've been interested in. Turn based battles, a classic space opera. Yo this is lit. Stop reading this and go download it RN.",Positive
Great game! They really do give u many pulls. Not that time consuming since their dailies don't take as much time as genshin. CGs are just fantastic üëç,Positive
"Love this game the graphics are awesome, story line great but I just don't care for all of the reading other than that great job!!!!",Positive
"Fantastic game, fantasic developers, constant new content, generous rewards, amazing story and characters, great graphics, its the perfect gacha game",Positive
"Really loved your game and all Has the best graphics in a mobile game But hoyo please do not make the game unplayable because for some freaks The swarm,conundrum mode is almost unplayable for us players who joined mid game",Negative
The game itself is great. The characters and storyline is great too. But I personally want a Co Op mode.,Positive
I'm only giving a 1 * because not only this game don't start all I've got is the opening part of the game you know why you fill in the joining up form not only I did not receive the email with code but nothing so I went though my Facebook it excepted it straight away and then nothing happen still just the beginning so yeah might as well just uninstall it,Negative
"I Got seelie out of luck, but her element is not working, so i went to report the bug, turns out the bug reporting panel is itself bugged, it's just stuck on loading, now how can i report it to devs?",Negative
"HSR is a great game, but Its getting very boring at endgame not much activity to do , many of my friend quit the game..pls add new content that didn't require Trailblazer power..thanks",Negative
I give this game 2 star because of the graphics is not good for playing and the loading thing is very very slow even I have a good Internet connection fix this problem,Negative
The features in this game is good. Its a wonderful RPG games with gacha. Honestly the RPG games fan would like it. I would like to suggest this game to my friend,Positive
Cool game until you have you have to re-download 7 gigs worth of data because of a maintenance patch. These guys really know how to waste your time.,Negative
Game overheats and drains battery really quick on my phone and I got a decent one too also thier too much dialogue and side missions for a mobile game they should realesed this on console too with all these restrictions,Negative
I have an issue. Why isn't my character warp records showing? It's been like 5/6 days still my records aren't showing. On top of that everything disappeared from my previous banner records.,Positive
"Um... to be honest, I kinda like the gameplay and the story but bad luck me. I log into my Google account and I wanna to move my account to my pc but there no Google account I could log in so.... yeah 3 starüôÇ",Negative
I was very excited to play the game but it keeps giving me login error prompt from 2 days btw I had already downloaded all the game files 3 days ago so Im very disappointed not being able to play the gameü•πü•πü•πü•≤,Negative
"Does not run on pixel 6, after the initial download I receive a black screen after restart. Have tried multiple reinstalls to no success.",Negative
"Cool games but there is one thing need to update for next ver, like more content, event, and the story for sure. For now i got boring cause there is nothing i can do",Positive
Thanks to All the Developersüëè. I hope this game continued to doing positive updatesüëç & learn form other franchise mistake to be able to avoid it in the future‚úçÔ∏è,Positive
I love the game but now I have an issue so when I talaport to the train to start the Quist an invitation without proffer found myself stuck in space and can't talaport or move I logged out an in again but I still stuck,Negative
"Unbelievable... Stunning, console level graphics and storyline on your cellphone. Just blown away, great job guys",Positive
Horrible pull rates expect hard pity every time as with all hoyo games. Gameplay can feel repetitive with auto combat and just running around from point a to b to c ect.,Negative
I would have liked the game to have more features besides combat and story.. it feels a bit bare bones.,Negative
"Effort. That is all i ask. What i really respect about Hoyoverse is that despite it being a Gacha Game, the title oozes love and true genuine effort. The gameplay is satisfying with room to grow and the story is satisfying. Well done.",Positive
"A really good immersive experience with lots of Genshin Similities. However it's like Hoyoverse did took away Genshin's flaws and corect it in HSR. It's also a pleasure to all Honkai Fans to see again some old chracters as Welt, Seele, Bronya, and ofc our Lovely Himeko back with a totally reworked personnality and appearence. You'll get your 1rst 5* through the begginer banner within 50 pulls instead of 90. Best point is Auto farm with x2 speed which can be done AFK.",Positive
"Best kind of turn-based RPG, Game is impeccable I just got one issue I've been here since day 1 and I still don't have bronya. Spain is where I'm currently living rn. Amazing game by far just Please send bronya rate up banner I'm pleading.",Positive
"This game is good, the design, the mechanics and the rewards! I could see why Genshin players are mad.",Positive
A gacha game where the developers are generous/ the gameplay are also excellent. The only sad thing I experienced in this game is that I never won a 50/50,Positive
I think game is very good because now also I had not played because this game needs 7gb net but I don't have that much net or ram or storage so I think I can't play so who can play that is good,Negative
The game was good. But today start when play the game automatic black screen. Plzz fix the issues,Positive
One of very few mobile games that respect players' time and money. No words can describe how amazing this game is. Definitely 5stars game,Positive
Please add a mute button to the patch downloader. I want to listen to other things on my phone at this time and cannot access settings to mute you.,Positive
Honestly a solid ga ha game getting frequent updates to content. Also the development have been pretty generous giving a limited 5 star character which is great,Positive
"I'm currently playing both genshin and star rail and so far, star rail is a top tier game for me, i recently felt burn out playing genshin impact, I'm sad to feel that way.",Positive
Fun game for the story but same as genshin impact there is going to be 0 content l8er on and again the only content are the characters sadly but the game is good for the story.,Negative
Game has the same predatory gacha character copy system as genshin. Characters change how they function by getting additional copies. This was the main reason I stopped playing Alchemy Stars as well.,Negative
"Good but I have an issue where it lagged then I got stucked between two objects, now I can't even move and even teleport since it's still tutorial.",Positive
"Good sure if you are casual or casual hardcore but as always drop rates and prices are one the worse, just like honkai impact and similar things to genshin so be careful it's a got ya game with good gameplay overall.",Negative
"A turn based RPG with Morden game design.......I really like it. But I have one Major disappointment that majority of turn based RPG games have either Male or Female as Main character, but Hoyoverse did their thing and let us choose between Male/Female üòûü§¶ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶......... this Fandom will aslo become ""Gay and Toxic"" like Genshin Impact. I can see all Gay and lesbian people making ships between friendly and non-shipable characters ü§¶üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®. PLEASE GOD!!!! make this game unpopular",Positive
Not Whale. Moved on from Genshin. Not getting bored at all. Played scene it release. Love every character and arts. Not recommended to play on potato phone.,Positive
"Such a scam. Whenever you're near to beating hard bosses such as Svarog, the game disconnects you and restarts from the very beginning. This game is ridiculous.",Negative
"A really enjoyable game, I like the characters design , graphic, story the only problem is that when I played it my battery decreased so fast",Positive
I wnna play the game. I can play genshin in the device im using but when i start the game it always says log in error I've switched accs and redownload many times why isn't it making me play???,Negative
good! But i have been stuck with a xray background (black background) where i see everything but not the walls and floors? please fix this :((,Positive
"As much I love the game, when I downloaded it (and the previous account in the game was connected to my Google account) the game restarted my whole progress.",Negative
Great game liked it but the cutscenes are very laggy when the graphics are very low it's just so laggy please fix this I hope you add a video cutscene quality it would be awesome if that is true,Negative
Great art work...horrible control...to much dialog... didn't catch what the story is about which makes it confusing,Negative
"Can't really take the game seriously because everything feels like happy-go-lucky like story, character atmosphere, skill etc. nothing feels thrilling in this game just like the recent MCU movies.",Negative
"Despite not being an avid fan of Hoyo since I just don't like how monotone is Genshin, this is The best gacha in 2023 so far. It totally feels like a passion project just on how the characters act and alot of so many references :)",Positive
"i really love the character design's and the plot, and i'm addicted to it now, if you haven't played this game yet, you should really download it!",Positive
"The rate is 99.4% you will not get 5*hero. Why 50/50, no 5* char no progress. The ads about free 80 pull is fals, because you give 20 free and the rest are rewards (not free) for lvl progress. Aslo, fix seele costume, is like swimsuite with shorts.",Positive
I'm getting a constant crackling sound from the game thay won't go away. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it's still there.,Negative
"Getting ready for Wed, good luck everyone with pulling for your favorite character! The game is going to be really interesting. ‚ú®Ô∏è",Positive
Definitely good game well it do be expected for a company game who created genshin impact and honkai impact. This game feel anew for a player who didn't play turn base like me I recommend it to try it out,Positive
Played it and couldn't log in back in .. not going to play a game. Not going to play and advance and I have to restart all over again . Weak source,Negative
"Open world sucks compared to previous games, movement sucks, optimisations sucks, turn based is already a genre i dislikes, this one doesn't even have any depth, might as well play fate at this point",Negative
"I love this game BUT the LAG and the RED PING ugggghhhhh!!!!! I researched in Google about this issue and apparently, this is widespread in HSR despite the player having Great Internet and High-Specs PC/Phones. When will the Ping get better?",Positive
There are a lot of issues in this game.For example only a few players able to got twitch live stream rewards. Most of the people waste their valuable time by streaming but in the end they Couldn't collect rewards so dissapointing.Another thing is hsr 5 star characters drop rate is very low compared to genshin.Most of the players get 5stars at hard pity and lose 50/50 most of the times.Looks like game is taking away from f2p players,Negative
Everything about it to the last bit is amazing. It's simple yet so attractive it's pretty much one of the best gacha games.,Positive
the game is great but im experiencing bug whenever i open characters its turning black screen and crashing idk why. my phone still can handle the game graphics but its soo laggy in mid graphics,Positive
Game is good but I don't like a thing that is the storage please reduce some of the game size so that people with mid devices can also play and enjoy the game,Positive
"Can't even play. The loading screen comes up with the train thing, and I sign in, but it NEVER EVEN WORKS. PLEASE FIX THIS!",Negative
"ABSOLUTELY ENJOYABLE GAME EVER!!!, the gameplay mechanisms, minigames, characters and also the scenery is astonishing.",Positive
The game is crashing my phone alot. It happens after half a minute of gameplay after the update.,Negative
"The Devs are so open to feedback, it's insane. Really pretty game, with amazing characters and story!",Positive
This game is my absolute favourite since release. This game never fails to amuse me with its amazing storyline and it's beautiful animations.,Positive
Great game! Wonderful looking and actually an enjoyable experience to play unlike most games nowadays which seem to be designed to make u angry or irritated.,Positive
"The game consume too much battery, like 50% of my battery in 30 minutes, even genshin only consume 30% in 1 hour. This is the first game that cause my phone to overheat on medium setting lol, not even genshin can do that. Poco f3 user here.",Negative
I loved this game but when I tried to log in today my account had been reset. I was above trailblazer lvl 35 and now the game wants me to start all over again??,Negative
"I came from genshin impact,And I love honkai star rail but when I tried to play the game it made an error ex:1001_3 and other types but this one is the most common,Please fix this.",Negative
"Great game, but the simulated universe is trash. The new mode tries to make it different but it is still boring.",Positive
"If you are a long-term Genshin player, you would know that everything we players wished for in Genshin is im this game. And if you love turn-based RPG then it's a total steal! Easy 5 stars you nailed it again Hoyo!",Positive
"Game was great, but, I was flushed down the toilet into a traproom with no escape. Im sorry if I misunderstood if there is an escape, but to me there isnt.",Positive
"Really nice polished game with no intrusive popups. I was surprised that the english was good as was the story, for a game.",Positive
"Please don't fall for the trap of eighty pulls for this game. It is a scam to waste about twenty to sixty hours of your time. Just trust me. The first 20 pulls are all free but then on out is just a slow burn to waste your time. This game sucks on mobile cus of the camera controls N you can't skip the trash ""Story"" plus 300 pulls for a 5 star so you know the rate is doodoo",Negative
Honkai Star Rail the best game that came out in the last year of 2023 and it still is,Positive
"honestly I want to play the game but straight up these ads are so bad I'm just not gonna no idea why they're hiring Ukrainian people to advertise in English it makes no sense and it creates extremely low quality scammy looking ads , I played a bit but im not gonna play a game that puts out ads like that it kills my mood for the game everytime I see that lady with the big ears",Negative
"I really want to play this but i can't, i tried it once with my friends phone, i was jealous because he can play, in my phone i can download it but then i comes to first cut scene i will instantly crashed and, and crashed all over again i hope i can play it to my phone VIVO V2022",Positive
"Like Genshin, Hoyoverse really did a good job on this game. The character design is awesome and the the story is good.",Positive
The best game you can natively play on a phone. Runs like a dream and looks great. Honestly more technically impressive than TOTK considering the hardware.,Positive
HSR is a lot of fun. There is a lot of great gameplay content and I've really enjoyed the story so far. Looking forward to the next big update!,Positive
Your game really is bad. There is no originality. Your ads are annoying. I played two days and I was done. Another eden was so much better,Negative
Account management was an absolute nightmare and led to me dropping the game before I even got out of the tutorial.,Negative
"Absolutely amazing , great character designs , beautiful gameplay , amazing story in my opinion a game worth of spending money",Positive
"Please fix the internet distribution problem, I have excellent internet speed and signal but the game itself is having issues otherwise would've rated 5 stars",Negative
I absolutely love this game and I only downloaded cos of a bunch of ads I've seen and my friends play it too. Amazing 10/10 another amazing hoyoverse game!,Positive
At first i could play the game then after it updated i can't even log in i have so much storage left but still couldn't enter the game i really spent a long time playing this :(,Negative
I'm super excited that finally this game came out but now my experience after i updated this game when i opened start it kicked me out of the game idk why i just wanna play and there's plenty more gb i have but i don't know your game does that i hope you can fix mine btw I'm using vivo y15.,Negative
"literally my favourite game, gameplay is amazing, events are awesome, characters are cool. this game is perfect, if u haven't tried it, try it now",Positive
"can y'all add 2 banners for the next update? not like genshin, this game is only provided 1 banner.. I'm not interested with the character and must wait for the change banner.. but this is amazing! like it!üíõ",Positive
"7/10 The characters are the same anime caricatures you see everywhere else, and just as shallow. The dialogue choices are all terrible; designed with scarcely literate adolescents in mind. Exploration 8/10. Graphics: 9/10 Music. 9/10 Characters (so far) 4/10 Gameplay: 7/10 (Takes from the best of turnbased) Note that 95% of the 'humor' is your everyday witless sarcasm. After the latest update, it tries to reinstall the game over and over. Can't even open the game.",Negative
To me it lived up to the hype the gameplay is smooth so r the cutscenes and animations not to mention the story is good and the characters personalities great,Positive
"The game is fun good graphics unique playstyle overall its a 10/10 for me tho People need to understand this is a turn based game unlike genshin impact, Comparing the battle style won't do anything tbh im so sick of seeing reviews hating on the game just bc its turn based like grow up not all game is like genshin impact",Positive
Loved game great story great character designs fun to play amazing music My whole thing I'm not really hype about is it takes too long to recharge your energy to do your farmable stuff,Positive
I love this game as much as I love other games they developed. The graphics and the story is so beautiful. Thank you for this.,Positive
Why would you do turns in a fight and the gameplay is not immersive at all. Yeah we get it that people are going to compare it with Genshin which js the best game on all platforms but still this js not a game that's enjoyable.,Negative
I really like it! Very fun just like Genshin Impact The combat system is intresting i started at 1.3 but deleted my account but then i wanted to try again.,Positive
"Can be a fun game if you roll the right characters, but I would strongly recommend NOT whaling this game. The gacha rates are so low that they don't even publish them. So best of luck.",Negative
"IN TOTAL THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, BUT AS FOR SOMEONE WHO'S SO DUMB FOR ACCIDENTALLY DELETING IT, I CAN'T GET MY RESOURCES BACK. EVERYTIME I TRY TO LOAD IT, IT DOESN'T WORK, AND IT ALWAYS RESTARTS WHENEVER I OUT THE GAME, LIKE IT DOESN'T DOWNLOAD IN THE BG, I WANNA DOWNLOAD RESOURCES IT TRULY, BUT ISN'T IT BORING TO JUST WATCH THE LOADING SCREEN??? IT MAKES ME WANT TO QUIT THIS GAME OMG",Negative
I love this game but the new update made it bad like i cant even get to the game it just got stuck for me the only thing i could is to delete it cuz there is no use i am really sad cuz i had reached have of the stories and now everything is gone pls fix it,Negative
"Good game, I love the aspects and music and story play of the sounds. The game trifle is like you mean an actual space Form kasiya Bell",Positive
Game is so good. One thing that is not good is when you dont have a certain character you cant finish some contents since you are lucking on man power,Positive
ive binged this game since it came out and its the best turn based mobile game i know of. runs good on my min spec phone too at medium to low settings.,Positive
I saw a ad for this that promised like 80 draws or whatever and thought since I liked genshin impact I might as well try it. I didn't get my 80 summons so I feel lied too.,Negative
"Love this game pog for the free ratio, great if you wish to grind or play on your free time but if you are not into turn based game might not be your cup of tea otherwise amazing game",Positive
The gameplay is fine. Interesting story and good characters. However the gacha is HORRIBLE. You can do several 10x rolls and not receive a single character.,Negative
"One of the most frustrating game ever from the servers, bug ang stupid systemg that requires you to have 4million cs to just to finish world boss. 0 to nothing rewards. Pathetic game try hard",Negative
"Rubbish game its a complete and utter downgrade in everything that made the honkai series great, to go from free flowing combat to this stupid turn based nonsense is beyond stupid by the developers don't know why this game is on console and pc it's a waste of space üòë",Negative
"Devs really know what the players want, i dont really have that much time to play games coz of work but they made this game easy to pick up and drop with almost no consequences. Genshim could never",Positive
"Man, this game is hilarious üòÇ. I like the meme reference in this game. the dialogue choice is funny and unique. The Easter egg is very entertain me as a player. Good job mihoyo and please add more meme reference in the future update üòÅ",Positive
Very fun to play and explore the world,Positive
"Penacony is amazing. This is what I meant by having a space adventure. The lore the mysteries the place, all of it looked so good.",Positive
"I really love the game , best and very dramatic story but I just hope the game can be optimize a little bit becuz something I facing a frame drop",Positive
"i really like this game, i hope i get jing yuan by the end of his banner but i have a good experience playing without him and we kinda need like more quests events",Positive
"This is to counter the BS 1 star reviews left by salty genshin players Great game, great story, fun gameplay, amazing visuals, and awesome rewards. I sincerely hope that it only gets better ü§û",Positive
"kafka best character in the game, it have controller support (GENSHIN COULD NEVER) which i personally care about because i like how a controller feel.",Positive
"I really like this game. It doesn't have to use half of your phone gb like genshin impact but no offense. I really like genshin, but honkai Star Rail has become my favorite game<3",Positive
Ok nice game but still not enough why skill/magic only 1 and just 1 brust/final attack feels like genshin but in turnbase =_= why not follow like finalfantasy or phantasy sta/star ocean sometimes feels boring its just same like genshin nothing new and suckkkk gacha rate but dont care just focus finishing stories and retired. Plus prepare grinding repetitive......,Negative
What rate higher if it weren't for the mission you meet Argenti where they don't tell you exactly what you're facing so you're stuck fighting self replicating bugs who you can't kill fast enough cause guess what. You can't break them,Negative
"Your normal simulated universe suck. Its so rng. For example, i choose path of destruction but i got blessing other than destruction like i cant get 3 to 4 it unlock. Do something about it",Negative
Its good and all but please add the feature where i can delete the things that i already did so that the file size of the game will reduce just like in genshin impact.,Negative
Honestly the gotcha in this game is wrose then Genshin and on top of that the amount of dialog IS INSANE!!!! and there's no skip feature i swear these deves just love making these crazy dialog heavy games and force you to suffer,Negative
The best turn based rpg game i have ever played :),Positive
i really like this game but there are glitches in the that ruin my gaming hour my genshin is not laggy but when it comes to this game i can't even move and the ground are black like i really like this game but this problem make me quit,Negative
My long most waited Turn-based RPG game that I loved the most! I can't wait to see the characters I loved the most! This is the first turn-based RPG game made my miHoYo and COGNOSPHERE.,Positive
They took out the skip button from CBT so you're forced to wait for EVERY. SINGLE. LINE. of dialogue on the game Nice to not give your players the option,Negative
"From what I experienced, this game is really fun, I didn't know what to say but the way you can interact with item like a trashcans is really funny",Positive
I love the game and I wanna continue playing it by it's such a heavy game 24 GB my phone is 64 GBS and I don't have the space for it unfortunately,Negative
"It takes too much time to actual play ingame, everything is locked behind story just as genshin, characters powercreep is real so it doesnt matter if you pull the new 5* next one will be stronger. Simulation World takes toooo long to complete, MoC is imposible without 5* and the artifacts/relics are even harder to farm...",Negative
"I love this game! It's everything I was hoping for in a turn-bases Hoyo game. Please let us jump though, even if it's useless it makes walking around more fun üò≠",Positive
"Love the game. Definitely could see the effort the devs put into this game. I especially love all the wity dialogues, references and also the easter egg!",Positive
Ever since i started the game from the day it release it was fun but now it is from good to worst bad gacha rates even i play the game is laggy and already regretting coming back and the rewards are not that tempted to make returning players come back,Negative
"Lmao, dialogues and cutscenes are still unskippable, Mihoyo are still aftaid to hurt their writers fragile ego more then they value players time. If you manage to interest me in your dialogues i would read them regardless if there was a skip button or not, but by forcing me to sit through all of it like in genshin is just killing any desire to play alltogether.",Negative
"It is enjoyable though lately it often freeze and exit, whenever I tried opening the app it just says error login",Negative
This game everything interesting like genshin impact but went I do graphics to medium everything bug like old think be white and I just can see character plss fix it I can wait to play this game !!!<3,Negative
"My entire game freezes when I use a character,'s ultimate. I tried lowering graphics, yet it doesnt seem to fix the problem",Positive
"Great Game, I like the story it's interesting and detailed. You can choose a choice which is better",Positive
"Honestly 10/10 game, i got no complaints. Lore wise, character designs, the maps, even the battles with music especially with bronya's mother is just too good.",Positive
"Thanks to the dev reply I was able to fix the crashing issues. Great game, please bless my future Acheron pulls.",Positive
"Really love this game and the gameplay so smooth, but i dunno why when cut scene is getting lagging even the sound is like robot, can you fix this?",Positive
"I'm not a huge fan of gacha games but i did find myself enjoying this one alot,graphics and the anime chars look really good and it runs well enough on my phone",Positive
The QoL implemented in HSR have left me not wanting to return to Genshin. Edit: now realizing the artifact grinding is a lot worse than that in genshin. What a frustrating experience!.,Negative
Great game & it's deserve all the love from world Great ANIMATION & Fun gameplay & Great characters design & stories & ((( Fun dialogue!!))) All thanks to HSR team for this legendary game üèÜGAME OF THE YEAR üèÜ,Positive
I can't play it login error 1001_2! Come on dude i don't even got a chance to play it at all I've even predownloaded it! It's just disappointing!,Negative
"Big Fan of Genshin, Big Fan of Star Rail. Always love the effort the dev put into creating enjoyable and fun game cant wait for the story to develop even more with each update.",Positive
"please fix the cutscenes! it lags and the audio glitches :( this doesnt happen to my genshin but only here, please fix it so i can also enjoy the cutscenes thank you‚ô°",Positive
"Version 1.4.0 is broken on my Tab 6. After the latest patch, also would not open on my Samsung Note 20 Ultra. Always crashes. Please fix",Negative
This game is overall super fun. Now I'm addicted to both genshin and Starrail. My only disappointment is. This game doesn't have the chat option and co op mode,Positive
"Can't play, i liked the gane on PC but i just can't play on mobile, everytime I enter, I get the error message 1001_1, saying there's a problem logging in, which doesn't makes sense cause I played before on PC with the same account with no problems",Negative
"This game is very relaxing, and I enjoy turn based games ( expect chess ) . The charecter designs in this game are just too good üëçüëç.",Positive
"it's pretty good so far ! i absolutely love the graphics and all the characters, and how there's so much to things collect",Positive
"Want another genshin but different skin? Play it, this game have exact same system environment like genshin. I would give 10/10 if it's not another genshin system copycat, everything a lot of people hate from genshin is here, the 50:50 gacha, artifact farming, etc. If this is a skill based game i would forgive it the same as i forgive genshin, but turn-based genre is skill-less and more tactic focused. Ditch the substat on relic farming and this would be 10/10 game for me",Positive
Add a replay feature so we can rewatch cutscenes,Positive
I fell in love with the effect in this game at the beginning of the game. Sadly I'm stuck at tutorial because I'm stuck and can't do anything,Negative
"Phenomenal game,could be better . the luofu story is meh and felt really rushed(the cutscenes are cool tho)one more thing...skip button plz",Positive
Fun game. Enjoying every little bit of details the game offer. Although there is a bit of problems with the game sometime I enjoyed it none the less,Positive
This is the best game ever I installed....but not very smooth to play in mobile....so to the new player I suggest you to play in laptop or Mac,Positive
"I don't want to watch the story but I have to , there is no skip or something similar. Not everyone care about story. Forced to do something is really annoying.",Negative
"Please what is the error 1001_3. I have good network connection... I can't play. Help pls,. Thanks for fixing it",Positive
Awesome game. Nice mechanics! But why the overwhelming amount of female characters? It's crazy how all these JRPG games just bombard us with female characters.,Negative
"It is a very entertaining game that respects your time, Good events, goods story in general, Good music, Lovable characters and a crazy good battle system",Positive
Great production values but otherwise just a live service JRPG with a mediocre story and tons of fetch quests. This game is basically a gambler's version of Star Ocean.,Negative
This is my favorite game! I love characters and plot. Also I love the battle mechanic. This is so awesome! Thanks Hoyoverse for Honkai: Star Rail!,Positive
Best mobile game I've ever played 100% worth your time very rewarding for free to play or cheap to play and very long term replayability honestly getting a PS5 because of this game and how beautiful it is,Positive
"I love this game!! I started playing it because I loved Dan Heng design, but the game itself didn't disappoint! It's pretty entertaining and funny.",Positive
"Kicked a trashcan prince, and it speaks vocabulary i can't comprehend. 10/10 Just the cutscene issue is still not resolved yet...why :'(",Positive
Game keeps getting stuck at the loading screen and i can't load into the game. I have cleared my storage but it still wont open,Negative

"S23 Ultra. No issues, no stutters, no crashes. Game plays flawlessly, only gripe is the amount of content and features recycled over from Genshin and Honkai 3rd.",Positive
"Fun and challenging turn based rpg, Hoyoverse really knows how to make a fun game, and the protagonists are so much more entertaining than Genshin's.",Positive
"Can't pass the main menu screen a couple of times!.....after downloading all resources n restart, it stuck!.... there's NO download indication or anything..... :(",Negative
Best game ever. But one problem is this game need more optimisation,Positive
"It is better than I expected for sure. Takes a bit too much time, though, but it is faster than other similar games with similar formats. A quality production.",Positive
this is why I quit honkai star rail they kept making phase 2 boss. This is so damn unfair I'm uninstalling this game...why do u need phase 2 I ain't doing the trailblazer quest I can't even defeat the damn boss. I can't even fight them . The boss kept attacking my characters.,Negative
Loved every bit of it. Unfortunately my phone can longer hold it and Genshin Impact so I had to sacrifice it. Please do something about the space requirements üò≠üôè,Positive
"The game is great, but since it is quite new the content is very limited.. I'm at the point where I can't do anything so that saddens me",Positive
Decent game with Unskippable dialogs. And I'd say. Like the game is 75% dialog. Gatcha is pretty trash... but there's nothing to roll for anyways.,Positive
"I love the animation and the story behind every characters, it really make the story more depth.",Positive
"Great game! But the game can be better optimize, my device gets absurdly hot even tho it can run other game like codm & genshin without having difficulty",Positive
Love the game so far. Hopefully it continues to grow and they give us ways to continue to get resources at a decent pace.,Positive
"Mediocre gameplay with stunning graphics. Gacha rate is horrible, I don't recommend this considering the market is filled with other more interesting games.",Negative
"Server asia always gets error it's too jammed there, I had no choice but to log in to the American server. After that I've been quite enjoying my gameplay. (I love Kafka so much)",Positive
"I am a honkai player and a genshin player too. This game feels like a kid of honkai and genshin with characters from honkai in genshin UI but fight with turn-based. And that's exactly why I love this game, all I ever wanted presented to me in one place.üëå",Positive
i downloaded it twice( and the resources too) yet it won't play on my phoneüò≠ i wanna play this game so bad. i got no problems with my storage eitherü•∫,Positive

"One of the best turn based game to come out, the ost and the animations are too good.",Positive

I wanna play this game on my device so bad but it is very laggy and I know that the problem lies with my phone so I can't complain to the devs. Still giving the game 5 stat tho.,Positive
I like this game more than Genshin. Everything is more fleshed out minus the open world. Character designs are so cool!,Positive
The Game is Absolutely perfect Man never believe that there is so much beautiful game can be played in Mobile but I have request Hoyoverse to plz Fix the Error 1001_1 and 1001_2 plz it's Really bugging me now This error can only mean üòî Server has been filled I guess plz Fix this,Positive
"Since the new version update, the game keeps crashing as soon as I start it. I've been unable to play the game!",Negative
Honkai star rail is nice turn base combat type game ... Story is so amazing because each characters in this game have their own unique personality.,Positive
first of all I keep lagging in and out my screen sometimes is black and my characters sometimes glitch which I tried refreshing it but it keeps repeating,Negative
"Very nice, more generous than hoyo's other game (Genshin).",Positive
"The best turn based rpg gacha games you can hope for,as expected from renown Mihoyo works. Keep on improving,since there is still improvement can be done. Especially gacha system/monetization",Positive
"I've been trying to play and it keeps giving me the same error message. Unable to load, please try again later. I have an S23 phone with plenty of storage space. Can anyone help? If I can get the game to work, I will be happy to give 5 stars",Negative
"Best gacha game out there. Generous reward with amazing gameplay, stories, and especially cosplayable character designs. Keep it up hoyoverse!",Positive
"A wonderful and beautiful game, four stars because... in fact, I don‚Äôt know what the reason is. I don't want Genshin characters will be in Honkai, or Honkai characters will be in Genshin. I'm really going crazy, I won't understand what will happen next",Positive
Good game but gear RNG is the worst out of all the gacha games to the point it's stressing/frustrating me so I'll probably never come back unless they fix it,Negative
Love this game! Very smooth! The story is so good. Hope the developer can add multiplayer/co-op on this game! Thank you so much!,Positive
"Finally a Mihoyo mobile game with auto-combat, thank you for that and works well with my ROG Phone 7 (16GB/512GB) and my ROG Ally (Z1 Extreme, 16GB/512GB). I'll give this a 5 ‚≠ê overall!",Positive
"This is a good game besides genshin impact but the music in here is kinda lagging, it will be more good if the game file wasn't too large like 65 GB ??",Positive
"I love it , I am playing in both android and pc .It was stunning still i feel that they have jump feature. It would be amazing but its okay.",Positive
IT'S GOOD as a turn-based gacha game. The story needs some work though. Or am i just used to deep Genshin storyline? Idk. Will recommend it of you're tired playing Genshin. :3,Positive
downloading process is really really annoying üôÑüëéüëéüëéüëé,Negative
Best game I've ever played. I'm still waiting for Jing Yuan's return so I'm hoping he'll be back soon. Also looking forward to the next update (it's going to be pure chaos with Genshin community raging bsgsvs),Positive
1/10 was a good game until I lost my account this is trash I grinded so much just to loose my account what a silly game I justed wasted my time for no reason I hate this game üëéand plus what kind of battle is that u can't even choose the character to fight the game chooses for u,Negative
Great gameplay but atrocious pull rates.. going to be hard to use characters late game without ascending them. Don't get too attached to this game if you're f2p.,Negative
This game is trash absolutely trash I'm having a problem at the start of the game were I can't log in due to its error but I don't know why???,Negative
I love the game for its stunning graphics amazing voice acting and so on and so fourth I love all of the abilities and of course the ultimate's,Positive
"One of the best JRPG I have ever played, The characters,lore, visuals and the narration of the game is just on another level",Positive
When I arrived in belobog my game crashed and it changed its UID when i entered bringing me back to the very beginning of the game. Let skip dialogue and cutscene be a thing I hate to spend another 5 hours again,Negative

"They learned a lot from their other games, hope they could improve the QoL changes there too starting with stamina and artifact presets(please)",Positive
"It was a good game tho i wasn't interested in story but again is good but i have problems with login in,i should use VPN to log in and i live in iran,but i didn't needed VPN when i was playing genshin impact",Negative
"This game is simply awesome and, in my opinion, is way better then genshin because the characters feel more alive especially the MC because, unlike genshin, the MC ""talks"" directly bracus ethere is no pimon to speak for them which is onestly way better. The combat is also way better because, unlike genshin, you actually have to plan ahead not just chose a character and three suposrts and beat everything.The rewards are also better not like genshin's aniversery.",Positive
"It's a great game, everything about it and the story is awesome. Just wish the gambling currency for the pulls wasn't so scarce",Positive
"I'm really trying to enjoy this game but 20 minutes long for only story... Some blah blah here, some blah blah there, I can't even skip or speed up it.",Negative
Would give this game a 5 star if the log in screen wouldn't lag. I hope you will fix that since I really want to play this game.,Positive
"Start was fun. Game kind of went downhill from then. If this game was released 3 years ago, it would be amazing. But it's already 2023 so.... hard pass unless you're a fan",Negative
"Graphics are just as amazing as genshin, but those expecting genshin game play this ain't it. It's a very good game already, but it's turn based.",Positive
"I love this game but loading screen is driving me crazy bro i cant even join the game even if i have good wifi i cant get past the loading even if the loading finish it will not let me in because an ""error""",Negative
The reason it's two stars only because whenever I play it high Wi-Fi and internet it never let me play the game I thought it was a glitch I tried again it still won't let me play Please fix this,Negative
"Thank you for creating boothill, he was a blessing.",Positive
"So it's a sort of ""strategy"", turn based auto battle game which doesn't even work if you have your DNS adguard. Kinda disappointing after Genshin Impact *but I'm glad they kept the lengthy pointless dialogues and cutscenes which can't be skipped... *: Sarcasm",Negative
"It's easy to start with the 50 pull guaranteed 5* and later in the patch we'll get a free 5*!! As much as I hate to say this, genshin could never",Positive
"Amazing graphic, beautiful animation and music with interesting story background. Personally i'm quite satisfied with this one.. but the gacha rate is quite harsh as like Hi3 and Genshin ü•≤",Positive
"Great game!, just a problem.. the warp system is very lagy till the game turns rainbow I hope its just a glitch and be fixed soon! (Great game btw)",Positive
"From the graphics, characters and story, I think it's good, but in terms of gameplay, it's really lacking for me",Negative
I was interested in playing this game until your stupid ads wouldnt stop showing up for it on youtube. I'm so sick of seeing that middle aged guy freak out cause he got a good pull. He sounds stupid as well not a good way to advertise your game,Negative
ive already played a bit on my ipad and pc havent played it on my phone yet (im level 16) the only thing that bothers me very much is that theres no jumping mechanic coming from a genshin player,Positive
Once again mihoyo has made another amazing game it's simple fun and the story is great well at least am enjoying it some might not the characters are also really beautiful over all 10/10 in my opinion,Positive
"1.1 broke the game, won't update on wifi. Customer service doesn't care and is adamant its my phone but I can play genshin impact with no issues on wifi.",Negative
To be honest the game is good and other rng stuff but the thing that i wish to increase is the drop rate of the calyx. Thats all the rest is good but hopping to be better,Negative
"Game is fun until an hour or a minute into the game , you will have issues on lagging. This is a problem that you need to solve this , otherwise people may give up and quit the game to be honest . Fix this Lag Problem.",Positive
The game is very good the character looks nice and the voice of the character are impressive and some are kinda familiar the map horizon looks nice,Positive
Great game to play for a few minutes or also dive into for a solid story filled with a colorful cast.,Positive
Game is laggy and I don't know if it's my phone or the game and I really want to play this game so badly but the lag is stopping me please fix this I change the rate if this gets fixed,Negative
This game is amazing. I have played honkai star rail and genshin impact and this game feels like a cross over between both of those games. Absolutely amazing :),Positive
"Love the game but 90 pity with a 50/50 which you lose almost every time is absolutely ridiculous, worst of any game",Negative
Using Android 14 beta on my(pixel 6) the updated just stuck on loading screen with the train in out of space. I login w my Google account fix it. It work andro,Negative
"I like the game so much storyline,plot,scheme,.,....very nice game....graphics....sounds...music..background battle music......so good.....so far...5* for you ...I hope the incoming update is good ...",Positive
Don't be fooled by the people that come from Genshin and rate the game 1 star!! This is a great game with cool gameplay and cool characters. Definitely worth it!,Positive
"It's a Great game. if you complain about it's not same with genhsin or honkai, HEYY remember it's star rail. If you want the same game just play that's both game and don't give 1 star to this game cuz yours half brain.",Positive
The new place the sky turn black and white?? And when i do the setting backgroud and it turn whiteüò≠. I don t know how to do.,Negative
"Game is very good, to describe this game as accurately as possible, it's just fun all around and dynamic quests, whole game is an art, the creator of this company knows what they are doing and what they have in their hands. Absolute masterpiece.",Positive
"Boring gameplay, as usual it will get interesting when you get new character with your own money (5 star character only) but if you wanna play f2p its just get repetitive fast.",Negative
umm is it me or does everybody get all defense gear sets with the attack stats and all there quantum and lightning gear with defense stats this is clearly a bug and no way every piece of gear is like this.,Negative
"turn based fast paced, dailies are less than 5 minutes, not needed to spend a lot of time building teams.",Positive
Bro it's so laggy and my phone doesent even lag. It's telling me that an error occured and idk what's happening. Please fix the lag because I can't even play.,Negative

"Wasn't expecting a balanced Triple A experience with fantastic storytelling, actually hilarious moments and generous pulling. Massively surprised by Star Rail!",Positive
Thank you for fixing the issue!! I love this game so much! Everything about this game is so majestic and so fun to play! Im so excited for future updates and features!,Positive
Need to spend money to get powerful characters and weapons. Don't waste time unless you plan on spending money. Need 6 copies of a character at a 0.6% gacha and 6 copies of their weapon.,Negative
"I totally loved the game, although I was a bit sad that we still needed to get artifacts because I thought the card things were the artifacts,but cool game!",Positive
I really want to play the game but I can't because of the lagging and I cannot afford to get another phone. It would be really nice if the game was added to Nividia Gerforce Now,Negative
I have been a genshin player for a while and I can tell that this game was made and built upon from the mistakes that genshin impact has and honkai star rail is very easy for beginners and is very good,Positive
Honkai star rail is a very popular app! I us to play genshin but I moved from here! It doesn't take as much gb and my either! The graphics are also amazing!,Positive
The story behind each characters are hard to forget like Blade And Dan Heng. I also love the animations and music of this game.,Positive
"i love this game so much i just hope the it just won't be hard to get currency for pulling for characters especially late game since the 5* chars are all really great to get, hoping for future eventsss",Positive
"It's fun and cool games but idk if my device didn't support this game? Everytime I opened the game, it keeps kick me out. I've already leveled up the charactersü•≤",Positive
Best game ever so far.. fun to play.. Nice graphic.. Easy n enjoy gameplay.. Hopefully the game can expand bigger like genshin impact (story/character/gameplay) ..,Positive
Looks like a fun game just for some reason and it's not just me it's other people on this device is that we can't hear audio except for a couple of cutscenes,Negative
"Don't play if you don't intend to put money in it. Horrible, abysmal, horrendous drop rate! Started day one and In 3 week that I played I got one UR and that was guaranteed in a 50 pull. After that NOTHING, ZERO, NIET, RIEN, NADA. I kept everything for an event I wasted my ressources on ticket EVERYTHING I HAD, I made around 90 pull NOTHING, I then tried the normal banner around 50 pull... nothing NOT ONE UR... I Wasted everything and the ressource you get from the rewards are so bad/low....",Negative
"Clunky movement, unskippable cutscenes, SLOW and UNSKIPPABLE dialogue, and it overall plays like a unpolished and lackluster thoughtless turn-based anime simulator.",Negative

"Excellent playstyle, phenomenal characters and designs, and an expanding universe of infinite possibilities. Another masterpiece by Hoyo without doubt!!! ü§©ü§©ü§©",Positive

So far game is amazing but i have a problem on buying the express supply past even if i finish the main quest or is it because it is new on mobile phone and i need to wait for version 1.1 because each time i want ti buy it always say data not referesh,Positive
The game story and the gameplay is good but the Ads are scam :( It said download now and get 30 free spin.Wheres the spin ticket he mentioned?! :((,Negative
Please add a sound when someone chats you. Or a little animation near the chats/messages. Thank you.,Positive

"this game is great as i expected!! its still a new game so im excited for further update, like event or new feature. this game is fun also the npc, each dialog is so funny",Positive
"There are seven elements. Seven paths. Seven characters on standard banner. Himeko, erudition, fire. Bronya, harmony, wind. Bailu, abundance, lightning. Gepard, preservation, ice. Clara, destruction, physical. Welt, nihility, imaginary. Yanqing, the hunt... Ice. Wow, it's not as if there's some other five star that's both The Hunt and Quantum... If only... Perhaps the very first character to get a limited banner... Maybe one day I'll wake up and it will have all been a simple mistake. Please.",Negative
I could open it but after downloading it and logong in it said something like downloading complete then it gives me the option to restart but after I start it again it just doesn't load,Negative
This game went downhill fast. This latest event just wasted time and bores you to death. There's non-stop pointless talking and running around with no fun gameplay. Don't waste your time on this game like I have.,Negative

Crashes every 30 seconds since newest update. Totally unplayable Edit: Working fine now.,Positive
"Another well made game from the company of AAA mobile cross platform titles... ;) Maybe a little cloneing here and there from genshin and the world is much more empty, close and small, but it is a good game even on android...",Positive
Amazing graphics. Even better story line. Love the turn by turn fighting style.,Positive
"If your phone have a minimum spec to play this game. At least play at low settings or you can play it on pc,console or whatever is that called. And also if you don't have pc,phone or console. Maybe you can sell your kidneys lmao. Last but not least. (Pull banner jing yuan not seele) if you want to clear chapters fast in this game.",Positive

"Exceptional story and gameplay, the only complaint I have is that I'm waiting for the next story update. Love this game.",Positive
"I didn't read the game description carefully enough. This is a JRPG, not an RPG. It should be clear to you from the dialogue after the third fight whether you'll enjoy the characters or not. I didn't.",Negative
"This game I love it action, fighting and story line but may phone is Redmi note 11 pro 5g she is lagging 8 ram may phone but the Genshin impact high graphics and 60 fps smooth but the fps drap is ok fix it please to good and smooth gameplay thanks üôèüòäüòä",Positive

"Great strategy game but the story is not interesting in my opinion, I would like an option to skip the cutscenes",Negative
The game is so hard in beginning what a waste it can be better like why the character so weak and long time to level up just like any other game money grab like if you want money do skins only to buy game would be a lot better and coming to ps5 lmao good luck,Negative
"Its a love hate relationship, many things to love like story, gameplay and the hate for gacha. I wish more games worked like azur lane and league where you pay for skins.",Positive

"I logged out of my Google play account and when I tried logging back in it does not let me log back in, now I can't pull for Steele light cone.",Negative
"It's a well-designed gatcha cash-grabber. Honestly, if the developer wasn't so apocalyptically greedy and continuously stealing money from children and incels, they could make a great rpg on the level of Skyrim. They won't though, because they need those $20 outfits and $40+ characters through the magic of gambling.",Negative
"fun and great for lazy players like me because of auto battle, character design are absolutely wonderful and the lore right now is interesting!",Positive
This gane is very good the story is good it was unexpected for me to find this game thorugh an ad and to be this good the characters are diffrent and has alot of stuff we cam do althogh the combat is turnbased i can gladly aacept that ill gove this game 5 stars i recomend this game for anyone,Positive

"Great game, runs surprisingly well on my phone. Not experiencing any crashes at all unlike other reviewers, my phone is a samsung a53 5g",Positive
"Nice game, poor drawing chances. As I'm not interested in an all female team (seems you can easily draw them)... I'll sadly drop out.",Positive
"Very generous with their rewards... casual gamers can try this game... be careful of the rabbit hole tho, you might get sucked into it...",Positive
"I understand that the game just only got released but i hope the developers fix these bugs such as laggy cutscenes and shuttering audio when the cutscenes are playing, a not so friendly internet data consumption cuz just playing 5 mins of this game cost 200+ mb of data is consumed and all the rss is downloaded.",Positive
"The game is good I like the turn based game mechanics, it reminded me of the games I used to play like final fantasy and etc.",Positive
"Will not stay on screen while getting verification code from email to register. Just starts from the beginning, infinite loop. Garbage coding.",Negative
"+ High production value for a phone game + Classic JRPG mechanics + In depth battle system + Somewhat reasonable difficulty spikes - Predatory f2p, pay to win gacha system - Seriously, gacha games are absolutely scummy and will prey on your gambling tendencies.",Negative
"Awesome characters and story. Very well written, looking forward to future updates!",Positive
Good game play but your drop rate are far worst! 5 star drop rate same lvl with 4star are u crazy?? How to get 5 star char if u put same drop rate? U should put different rate between 5 star n 4 star. U guys are money sucker if the drop rate u make like this it's so HORRIBLE!!. WILL RATE 5 STAR AFTER U MANAGE THIS NONSENSE DROP RATE. TQ.,Negative
"Game is great. Downside is dialogue is too long. 90% of your time, is watching your character talking lmao. Just like genshin and honkai. You should put skip button.",Negative
"Out of all the turn based games that I've played by far this is the best one, I've been having lots of fun and I can't wait for more content.",Positive
Just another grindy gatcha game with pretty graphics and lots of ways to try and get you to spend money. Dialog and story are meh.,Negative
This is a great game but they need to add a jump mechanic even if it doesn't do anything it wound be nice to hop if they add this I will change my review to a 5 star,Negative
"I just tab and cancelled so I could tell you how annoying and cringe your YouTube ""memory abyss"" ads are. But then again YouTube ads are nothing more then shotgun spam and forget tactic.",Negative
"Great game, but I'm currently stuck because the trials of equilibrium are even harder than it should be and I can't progress my level",Positive
there were some glitches but they eventually went away after a third reset. finally can play! the game is so pretty~,Positive
So far I love it. I'll need to progress further to get the full gameplay experience but from what I've seen so far it's an easy 5 star rating.,Positive
Simple but entertaining turn-based combat. Funny and witty writing. Excellent treatment of fans by the generous developers.,Positive
"my account disappeared because if I try to login, it shows an error and now I can't retrieve it after all my hard work and progress. Accounts don't have security even with the amount of money this company has.",Negative
"Mentioning a few names in Honkai Starrail is quite difficult for me to remember, so I'll use the word from Genshin Impact. The use of Resin for the Artifact domain of 40 Resin for a 5-star Artifact, that was really expensive. I'm currently at level 50",Positive
"the fact that there is a false advertisement of 80 star wraps hurt the rating of the game, we only got 20 warps?? Where are the other 60???",Negative
Personally this is a better version of what genshin impact is overall only the gameplay is diffrent but all else its almost the same. And the rewards is better too,Positive

"Goodlord, sure the artifact system for synthesis is good but jesus the system for the stats are ridiculous. Its a lot worse than genshin. I literally only have 1 character that is useful enough with mediocore artifact stat despite playing since release.",Negative
This game is going really great right now no bug no lag or crash it's perfectly running So good and I had so much fun playing this game the character are adorable and cute,Positive
"False advertising, makes it seem like you can pull for characters in the trailers when you have to wait almost a year for them to even come back around.",Negative
"Not a chance! I literally only downloaded it & it took 13 gigs from my phone. Sketchy AF. Tik tik deleted (if I could give negative stars, I would )",Negative
The game is good but the dialog is bad can't even skip the dialog I just want to battle it gets boring playing the game if it is to long of talking,Negative

"everything is good but there is one concern, I ask you to fix the network problem in the game because my network ping is always 300ms even though my provider card and Wi-Fi are fast",Negative

The graphics very cool and i like my DADDY~~,Positive
"The experience so far in this game has been great, definitely looking for more story and content!",Positive
"It's alright, good story and gameplay, but it is seriously hard getting SSR Characters in the game, I wish they could make getting them a bit easier..",Positive
"Best rpg game I've ever played before. The game runs smoothly, But the cut scenes are laggy and shutter.",Negative
"On a Pixel 8 Pro. Alot of skipped frames, can't even run properly. My Pixel 6 fares better. Anyone else have the same experience?",Negative
Help every time I open this game it's alway black and I waited for a few minutes but it doesn't even show me the login scree pls fix this,Negative
"The game treats Their players really well. It just that I lack of mission and stories. Netherless,the game is really good",Positive

"When i finished the download for resources it say i need to restart the game, i did it but when i log in and click play it say i need to download it again. Pls fix tgis for 5 star",Negative
Crazy. Not a game. Can't get past some annoying attempt to sign in. Why do I need to create a password? Why all this security for a silly game?,Negative
"Loading screen = broken Please fix Game not working properly Loading screen broken and doesnt let me play the game Edit: raising rating to five stars because good game,good story,good graphics,and the loading screen glitch was fixed üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü",Positive
Way more enjoyable too play while you lazy to tap tap all the skill n enemies coz the auto battle function and the double speed fight,Positive
I'm raising my review to 3 stars. The gameplay is alot of fun. The gatcha is a rough spot since the rates are below 1% but I guess if you save up and only pull for certain characters you might have a chance at getting them. Overall it's still pretty fun.,Negative
The Game is really it has lots of wonderfully design characters and an interesting plot to the story!,Positive
"This is the best game I've ever played in .y whole life. I love the wishing system, the characters, animation. I'm so addicted to this game.",Positive
"Great graphic, great animation, but there is no skip button for story scene, not everyone spend that much time reading story especially like travel players like me...",Negative
"Do not open and whenever I enter and start downloading, it reaches half, then there is an error, and the download is from the beginning, and the matter continues until now üíîüòî",Negative

"As a Genshin Impact player, I recently played Honkai Star Rail and I have to say it's refreshing it's more casual than genshin since it's turn based and the dialogue are much more lively.",Positive
"The game is fun to play, especially on PC, but it won't load on the train loading screen when on my phone, i have the storage but somehow? It won't let me in",Positive
Very optimized for a android game hopefully they can make it more smoother at higher graphics without sacrifcing phone temps :),Positive
I love the app but it takes up 20 GB!! Super sad that I deleted it but it's a really good game!!! No wonder it takes up all yhat,Positive

Absolutely love this game. Get very strong FF vibes and it's a great anime turn based game and runs wonderfully on the phone *s23 ultra*.,Positive
"Game's really cool and all but the thing that annoys me so much that it keeps saying ""error code"" i can't even play the game.",Negative
Please add a coop feature where my friend can join my world or it's too lonely or I'm getting forced to play alone. THE DROP RATE IS WAYYY TOO LOW FOR CHARACTER ASCENSION MATERIAL! Increase it too,Negative
Installed this games for first time and first experience was login error which continued to comeback again and again. Bad experience and such a bad impression of this game,Negative
Only issue with me is story is little to complicated and smtimes that could just make me clueless and I don't feel involved at all in the story so i hope so u work on stories a little bit everything else A+,Positive

Can't be said I downloaded it whole file and play it for some hour and the very next 1 hour I went to eat the data reset as I couldn't say please save and secure data more,Negative
"The game is sooo fun and interesting but in case if you ask wherethe other one is,its the problem.Its wont let me download it i meant the recources.And its always reebooting pls fix that problem.",Positive
Not a very good game for a phone app. Probably would be better to release a real game for consoles. Instead of gatcha games on phones that are harder to play.,Negative
"I really liked this game but a few hours ago, I can't login. It keeps on saying ""Too many requests. Please try again later."" Its been 11 hrs. I just want to play bruh",Positive
Tap on a clip to paste it in the text box.,Positive

"It has good animations, Genshin in comparison has bad animations, I care about the game being smooth so this gets a good review",Positive
Great game. Main story is interesting also side story also fun. There're also some funny interaction especially interaction with trash can.,Positive

The game keep getting eror every time I open it. I didn't even have a chance to play the game. It's keep telling me eror 1001_4,Negative
Updated September 2023 Love the update 1.3 and the developer who's not genshin impact. HSR dev is better then genshit inksack And I'm hoping for updates on abit of the animations and tweaks on the game speed to be improved to 1.7 speed or 1.5 The speed feels like it's 1.2 I'm hoping to see collabs or even Kevin kaslana in the game.,Positive
it is so fun and you get the currencies so ez and fast this is a game that the f2p players will like you dont even have to spend money in this game just to get the characters u want,Positive

The fact you need to save up 90 pulls just for a 50% chance at getting a limited banner character is RIDICULOUS.,Negative
This game pit me throught the WORST emotional trauma I have EVER experienced. (Firefly) I don't like being subjext to extreme mental trauma just because the twisted devs think it's good story writing.,Negative
The best thing i like about hoyoverse is that their stories and music Also the graphics and character designs all are so good,Positive
why does it keep freezing when trying to battle monsters in Simulation? i have stable internet connection but it just keeps freezing....,Negative
Worest game ever! I wasted thons of my internet just for saying downloading resources.I waited for so long and there was no use .this is why I'm giving it only 2 stars,Negative
BS lore that you can't skip and take up to TEN minutes with cartoon graphics and terrible voice acting... Another cheap Chinese game,Negative

"I love it. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. More generous than a certain game within the same company. Haist---anyways, I'd definitely get SPARKLE ON HER RERUN!!!",Positive

"5* for the game. 1* for the community because of how they handle the leaks of, even though story is just whatever to me. Those that don't care about the story and only care about the ""competition"" in this single player game were happily spoiling the story to those who care about the story. It's not about the story getting spoiled but rather how the community is split and it became toxic. Based on my experience anyway. Won't be surprised if some say there's nothing to look forward to in Penacony.",Negative
"Ever since the May update,my game started lagging SO BAD even at the lowest setting. I already set it to 60 fps so i could at least get 35 fps or above but after the update,i cannot tell you how much do i need to set it somebody pls help meüò≠üò≠",Positive

This is a nice game and the graphics are really amazing and the story is quite interesting but sill this is a good gameüëç.,Positive
"Its a cool, fun, and free to play friendly game. It is a bit difficult at some parts",Positive
This game is so serious and so silly at the same time. Love the gameplay and ofc the characters and whoever writes the dialogues for the mc deserves a raise. Hoping for khoi dao to show up someday *fingers crossed*,Positive
"Detailed world, witty dialogues, great graphics, and nice pacing overall. But seriously, who even makes turn based rpgs without pvp these days?",Negative
The resources are long I love the graphics but I can't really play I would love to play but to long process to say,Negative
I like the game a lot fun to pastime storylines pretty good but it's gets laggy after an hour of playing get so bad that it's unplayable but really like this game,Positive
This is horrible. I was downloading after a long time and it just suddenly started to say my wifi is low. My wifi isn't even low and it's not even at poor,Negative
"The game was OK at best! But mainly I did like the game cos it was made by Chinese communist party from China, that only wanted to take money from other countries, to invent & strengthen their military of something that only benefit them.",Negative
Ive spent over 200 dollars trying to obtain 5 star characters frok draws. Ive gotten FOUR/10roll 4 star characters that i already have and i DONT USE. GIVE ME JUST ONE GD DESTRUCTION CHARACTER IS THAT SO HARD TO ASK. DO IT OR I WILL DELETE TF OUT OF THIS VAPID GAME AND 1 STAR IT ON ALL 10 EMAIL ACCOUNTS.,Negative
- Visual: Truly amazing. - OST: hella hype. - Characters: very noice. - Gacha rate: nice enough until you run out quests/event/MOC Overall: worth investing some money (with responsible).,Positive
"i think that this is a great game. the only thing thats making me mad is the floor and walls üíî they all disappeared even i try to download it or update it again, it still wont load. pLEASE FIX THIS‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èüíîüíîü§ëü§ëü§ë üò§üò§ü§î i lov danheng ü§ë",Negative
Horrible please fix the bug.,Negative
Lots of QoL/Free Pulls every update and even end game content. They even gave us a FREE LIMITED 5 STAR CHARACTER. Genshin could never.,Positive
"It was good but when the 1.1 update came, it was full of lag in my gameplay and i cant see the full map too, can you fix this?",Negative
Im at level 41 when will there be an update not much i can do and new characters have no way to earn any tickets and new plays can earn not fair they can get new characters while the day ones have to spend money,Positive
I can't even play this game. It kept telling me log in error even though i already downloaded all resources and sign in using Twitter.,Negative
i would love to actually get to play this game every time i start the game it starts loading an update says download complete game will restart go to a loading screen and never leaves that screen so disappointing smh,Negative
I dont understand why Honkai Star Rail is getting a free 5 star but Genshin only gets 3 wishes for all the support we gave this years? So Genshin is just a money milking cash cow and Honkai is Mihoyo's favorite child that gets all the benefits (free 5star and better QoL updates)? We've been asking for night mode since day 1 because it burns our eyes when playing at night and we still dont have it. And all of a suden we find out that star rail has that feature. Also star rail has better resin sys,Negative
I was playing the game but at one point I could not go on in the game with any of the characters and there was nothing else for me to do because the level would not let me go on.,Negative
"I can say that they've improved the game now. Hopefully, Honkai Star Rail will continue to offer more rewards to the players. I'm also expecting a lot for this coming Anniversary in April.",Positive
"I don't have to wait until my turn, then just press a button and everything is done. :( Now it's the enemy's turn.",Negative
Every time I switch out of the game it crashes and it ruins my progress in a fight and takes a while to get back in,Negative
"Phenomenal, life-changing, enjoyable, educational, strategically advanced. Best piece of game ever seen",Positive
it's a really good game overall but as time goes on there's little ways to earn stellar jades so it's hard to pull for characters as a f2p,Positive
"Bad mission design and bad gacha , just a bad game at all",Negative
I give this game 3 stars because it has some issues with loading screen it take time to long and some medium mobile phone have problem with that like me!!,Negative
"Garbage. Trash rates, lied about their 80 free pulls, combat system is just basic trash, and tutorial takes so long that you literally cannot reroll. They did that on purpose.",Negative
"great storyline that will make you cry,lot of interesting puzzle,great world design,much reward given to the player.",Positive
In the new update the map is glitching like the wall are gone floor npc gone pls fix it and the first release of honkia starial it was so smooth to me now it's so lagy so pls fix it begging I can't play it will ruined my experience,Negative
Beep beep beep. I nearly uninstall this because of that annoying voice. Whoever decided to add that annoying part please kindly punch him in the face.,Positive

"i didn't even get to play the game, it just shows a black screen on my phone. it didn't help that its a bit laggy too. a bit disappointed",Negative
I wish they would give out more giftsüò≠ it's hard for me too pull my characters I want but overall the game is fun highly recommend it,Positive
"Very first English review, it's a fun game , the character designs are stunning and the voice acting is amazing",Positive
"I'm tired with this game i literally finished the download and keep playing then the game started to download again dude i been waiting for hours. ""Download like the update thing??""",Negative
This is a 5. Absolute peak turn based game on your phone. If you have an itch to scratch then look no further.,Positive
A little bit laggy and need to restart the game again to reduce the lag but great animation storyline and unique game strategy,Positive
Definitely manageable and enjoyable for daily life. Without to spend too much time on it.,Positive
"Well , Its kinda challenging game . They might need to add skip button for ultimate pretty time soon",Positive
All in all it's great but there's a bug sauing like error please fix it immediately because my game can't open i try to over over and but it still doesn't work,Negative
"1. Force close while match 2. Low Fps in some map 3. Cannot press anything in train scenery Also god damn Mihoyo, there is no different this gacha rate like your other games. The rate so low for 5star char.",Negative
The worst story game ever. No skip button for lore. I just kind of stand there and agressively tapping the screen.,Negative
"Gorgeous characters, awesome story so far and the devs actually care about the fanbase. Couldn't ask for more.",Positive
If I can give it half a star I would in a heartbeat I can't even get past the loading screen you ask for so much data just lag and freeze the game yeah I'm good with this game ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,Negative
"False advertisement to get people to play the game isn't a good start. Ads about so many ""free pulls"" (80) has been nothing but lies, unless I am missing something.",Negative
"was excited to play hsr but the problem is how do i get rid of ""login error occured""? ive been trying to login multiple times still wouldnt, please fix it",Negative
It was really good love it but I didn't like how I logged in with the same username and stuff and I was so for and it made me restart the game from the beginning.,Negative
I love this game! the story is so immersive and really cool. I loved playing it om my phone and am now so glad I can play on my playstation 5!,Positive
"Graphics 5 star, Storyline 5 star, Character's Voice 3 star, Gacha system 2 star low rate, Petty system 3 star. Overall not pay to progress. Highly recommended!",Positive
It literally kicked me out and said load resources again like 5 times like bruh and then it starts me over every time... Seriously...,Negative
A beautiful and very fun game,Positive
"Can't log in to the game. Was working fine then it shows ""too many request. Try again later"". Reinstalled the app but still the same issue",Negative
"Love this game already from the start love the stories, characters, scenery, animations, voices and many more thank u for always creating such amazing games<3",Positive
"after a year plus, im still playing and paying for monthly. worth every penny.",Positive
"Better than genshin, and has combined elements of both genshin and honkai 3rd. Developers are very attentive to their player base and I love them for it. Keep it up awersomw devs!",Positive
"So far, so good. Needs a bit of optimization since it's heating up my phone more than genshin impact does.",Positive
Login error code 1001_2 been ongoing since launch and it's extremely frustrating feeling my fellow trailblazers leave me behind at the starting line like I've got my ticket but y'all won't let me on board please fix this so i can enjoy the game,Negative
"Beautiful new gacha game. Once I've explored the game more and can make a more in-depth review, I will edit this. For now, I'm optimistic and it looks great. It's coming for your wallets!!! Lol",Positive
This is the best turn based game I have ever played but when u start I would highly advice you to invest properly on the characters don't rush it,Positive
"Visuals are amazing and the time required to ""finish"" the game doesnt take to long",Positive
"The only reason why I'm giving this game a 3 star is because of the way you fight and the gameplay. If you like to fight in a way that you have to fight in something like Arena and adventure or stuff, this game is for you. But if when you have to fight and you go in some arena, then this game is not for you. But if you want to have going to adventures game, go to genshin Impact.",Negative
"The story needs to be better , you have plenty of time to write the XianZhou story , maybe not rush it too much.",Negative
"Fun, but the drop rates in relics, extremely difficult to get a good relic... or maybe I'm just unlucky üòîüòîüòî",Positive
"I like the game alot, it's very fun. But I'm surprised how the people who made Genshin Impact made this game(just kidding, I know about the game directors)",Positive
I love this game its amazing! But something I wonder is why does't the main character have a compartment? Everyone on the express has one except us,Positive
"IT WAS PERFECT, DOWN TO THE LAST MINUTE DETAILS",Positive
"Honkai star rail is a good game but since the 2.0 update came out my android device keeps lagging then crashing the app, Is there any way to fix that?",Positive
"Need some optimization, cause some of the game's cutscene like the very start of the game is very choppy for me, can you guys fix this",Positive
"I play genshin impact and honkai impact 3rd so when i saw this game coming out i was so excited but it laggy when i load up and i keep getting ""Login error. Please try again later"" ""Error 1001_3""please help",Negative
"I love how they actually listen to their players unlike their other game plus the story,music,gacha system, characters are all so well done.",Positive
Honkai star rail more like honkai star braile!!!,Positive
I really like the game but I deleted it for a few days but wenn I download it again and loged in I lost all my progress and this is the second time . So I hope yall can please fix this I beg you.,Negative
"Good graphics, story and waifus but the combat mechanics are way too simple and having to wait for so long for new content just got me to quit the game",Positive
It was really good but I downloaded from a video that said I would get free pulls and I never got them.,Positive
The game is so beautiful and pretty to play and hsr is so nice like a free 10 pull for every undated and now for second best game of the game a free 5 star? More nicer then genshin impact frfr üòçüòçüòç,Positive
The game turned out to be even better than I anticipated I'm not really into turn based combat but this game made it flawlessly Highly recommend!!!,Positive
"A very good rpg game, One of the best rpg game.",Positive

When i use himeko ulti my phone freeze and super laggy. I can hear the audio but not sync.. Pls fix this problem asap,Negative
"It's a great game. I don't know why, but it had me download 18 gigs but none of my information is there. I don't know what to do. Help, my progress is gone!",Positive
"It constantly crashes, and sometimes crashes so that you have to download the game again infuriates",Negative
Game play is a bit boring because Iam not a big fan of turn base. Rates are just as bad as genshin. Graphics are great.,Negative
My only critic is that we don't have much time to get to new the regions and characters so it's too fast paced.,Positive
"what a wonderful experience. it's friendly and pleasant. can't wait for updates, i think i might be a little too invested!",Positive
Well so far it has glitched and froze everytime I've tried to play it more then 2minutes so it's hard to give the game a good review if I can't play it,Negative
Day 1 player. Obsessed with how much the improvement the quality of the game and the cool Characters,Positive
"I keep getting an error saying I can't download the resources, so I can't even play the game. And that sucks because i was really excited about playing",Negative
"I don't see any major problem. It's nice to have a semi automatic gameplay, so that i can daily while doing other things.",Positive
Can you please add delete resources option? My phone is getting tired of this game and I might opt for uninstalling if the storage continues to expand,Negative
Why does the game not get past the screen where the train is on its way it space as a dynamic image. It just doesn't do anything or go past this point or change screen?,Negative
It was harder to login after the SW download update. Its keeps rebooting on the login screen its so annoying,Negative
the game is great. but every since the blade update i can't get past the home screen.,Negative
"Although a different genre of game, it does so many things better than its predecessor Genshin Impact. Still find myself playing Star Rail daily.",Positive
"They really force you to watch the story, like their writing is good or something. Really though it's pretty bad and boring which is why they have to force you to watch it. Also devs that do forced tutorials are just lame.",Negative
"I keep getting error 1001_3 when trying to log in. 3 star After two updates, tried europe and america server but still getting the same error, now giving a 1 star",Negative
"I kinda wish it was open world but I'm not complaining, I love it so much. Play it, it is a lot of fun if you love turn-based games. ‚ô•Ô∏é",Positive
"It's very good, but the combat system is bad for me + there is no co-op mode, which makes Genshin Impact a better choice.",Positive
"Plz...Make update in Saturday and Sunday...that's all...I can update my game at home. Monday and Tuesday I have to go back to college. If u do that, it'll really helpful and it mean everything for me. That's all, Thank you.",Positive
"The graphics are just a 10/10. I have been playing this game during 1.2, the characters are cool as well !",Positive

The game had a best graphic but the only problem I had was the game keep kick me after a few seconds.,Positive
I absolutely love the game but sadly the new pencony update takes up to much space so I can't have it on my phone anymore,Negative
I like star rail its good i just wish we coyld skip dilouge didn't hoyoverse learn from genshin i also hate the combate bc RPGs to me are boring but if you like RPGs you should get it!,Positive
"I playlay this game everyday; if you're looking for a turn-based combat game with high polish, you should try this out.",Positive
It's awesome I love playing it there's so many fun things to do and so many cool characters and the long missions are great I love playing this game,Positive
"Very disappointed and mad with this game, I play as F2P~ always lose 50/50 at 90 Pity (Hard Pity) this is really painful, my friend get 5 Star in 20 pity (Win 50/50) even F2P same like me~ so unfair.. I decided to stop playing and quit, never come back even awesome banner will come soon",Negative
"Everything is beautiful in this game and I love them all, but I'm holding back the remaining stars until Firefly returns.",Negative
It eats up your internet usage for unknown reason. Almost 4gb eats up within 2 days. Whats happening here? It even beats my youtube usage daily.,Negative
Im not much of a turn based game kind of guy...but star rail is just lit the story and the artstyle just hit different fr,Positive
"Awesome game, it's so refreshing to play. It delivers more than expected every patch.",Positive
fun game just wished that it didn't take up so much space,Positive
I quit at the start so I can't really say anything First game like this I've ever played Graphics were nice I got bored and thought it was mid so I quit Maybe it's just the intro that's bad tho,Positive
All the things to expect of a top tier game(for mobile). Slightly processor heavy but cant be helped.,Positive
Great game with a good story superb music and a really satisfying combat system and theorycrafting around it.,Positive
"A waste of data downloading it. It takes forever and doesn't load. Garbage In, Garbage Out programming",Negative
It's a great game. Please add control mode for the Android. It socks not playing with a controller,Positive
"downloaded the game and waited 3 day to play and it doesnt even let me log in with any of the ways and keeps saying ""login error"" all the time",Negative
"I like the graphics & easy control, no many Dailly task need work up, free & easy! Chill every day!",Positive
Very generous and caring devs love to support this team keep up the good work and make us entertain thanks devs. This is not fenshin stop review bombing her it will not work...,Positive
"game resource loading problem, its stops automatically and show loading error even in my fast internet please fix this issue!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Negative
Actually looks good In My Opinion But Sometimes Can Lag Especially On The Cutscenes Which While Working On the Current Android Can Run Slow On The Samsung A12. Overall My Enjoyment Is 4.5,Positive
"This is an amazing and emersize experience, along with an interesting storyline and great comic relief.",Positive
Pretty good ngl. The ads drove me crazy though. But I decided to give it a chance... Pretty good.,Positive
"I have been playing since launch ,I like this game good story ,graphics , character design,üëèüëè",Positive
This game is good. Have to make sure you have accounts log into it. Or else you lose it even if you knew the username of your acc. So hoyo can I ask If you can fix this issue?,Positive
"More micro transactions than actual gameplay. You can't even grind for mats because they have a daily cap on grinding in the form of ""trailblaze points"" it's a shame because the game has a lot of potential that's buried under all the greed.",Negative
One of the best games. These days genshin is boring but this game is just perfect. All characters are amazing. üòçü•∞üòò,Positive
Easy 5 stars Easy and not complicated way to get stellar jades/tickets Good graphics Good gameplay Free five star in beginner banner Very good lore and story Nice voice acting Nice design,Positive
When will you guys rework bailu? Also rework the relic system! It's horrible and a waste of trailblaze power. At least let us use the credits to roll for custom substats,Positive
"Great gameplay, community, Endgame, characters and developers. If you like turn-based games this is your new game. This game won't disappoint you, other than Hoyoverse's Genshit.",Positive
This game is insanely short. You would think they release it with at least enough content to outlast the battle pass.,Negative
"Giving 5 star cuz of the content you gave us (players), i thank you, now my only concern is we need an item that can doubled the Corrosion and Relics reward (aside from simulation)",Positive
Way better than Genshin. The Game surprised me In so many ways especially the amount of free summons and how F2P friendly it is. 10/10 would recommend.,Positive
Why is it when you download this game I've say almost half an hour for it to load the actual game amd yet I still see the train on my screen and it's like taken total ages for me to play this actual game why does it have to load so long I want to play this game,Negative
"Graphics are cool, but it's mostly story and sometimes you get to actually play.",Negative
"Thank you for the beautiful game, Can you fix skill icon for MC when ultimate activated? Sometimes it's disappeared..",Positive

I just love that I can farm in auto....also the story and character designs are awesome....not the mention the greatness of Stelle the trash loverüôÉ,Positive
I have a problem I can't enter the game it said login error and I tried to search on Google on how to solve this problem it said its because you use dns adguard or its overloaded with player and the dev Gonna fix it and wait for 2hrs,Negative
It's one of the best mobile games I have played and it is very ftp friendly. Highly recommend if you like turn based strategy gacha games.,Positive
"Its Amazing, i rarely found a mobile game where the dialogue has expressions, not even genshin nor honkai. The gameplay is kinda new and its good.",Positive
"I really like it so far! I like the playstyle, characters, and lore! Really good Hoyo, have recommended this to my friends who play other Hoyo games!‚ô°",Positive

"New world makes it even more complicated than ever. I hate this game, not enjoyable anymore since the quests are all trash now, especially the penacony. MAKES ME DIZZY",Negative
"I cant even download the extra resource,the game stuck at loading screen.Worst optimization for android devices,please fix this,One Plus 9 pro.",Negative
This game introduces annoying mechanics and has unfair progression. Just 1 main story battle take 20 minutes only for them to introduce some random bs that kills you instantly,Negative
Amazing game it's like genshin but oriented more towards a mobile audience so it's really great for anyone that loved genshin and looking for something that would be as good but less heavy,Positive
"""There's no turning back once you walk down this path."" Remember, there are a lot of fun interactives and storylines~",Positive
"Get banned for 1 weeks this morning. Never use 3rd apps while play star rail. Really disappointed, playing genshin for long time never get like this. Honkai star rail suck, will never played again and top up if my account don't unbanned in next days.",Negative
"Tried deleting and re-downloading a few times, but I can't get past the initial screen after start. :/",Negative
"I can't even play the game! As soon as it starts I can't move anything on the screen. The character just stands there saying,"" come on let's move"".",Negative
I love it it's a great game great characters and it's one of my new favorites because It reminds me of genshin which is another one of my favorites.,Positive
"I'm very excited for trying this game, many people disappointed because this is a turn-based RPG game. But not for me, i love to experience a new game. Thank You!",Positive
This is game is great for people who like strategy/tactic games. Can't wait for further changes and updates on this game in the near future,Positive
"For some reason i can't even download it. Every time it reaches 100% it gives me a message saying it failed. If this changes, i'll give it 5 stars.",Negative
"The game introduces new gameplay mechanics and you can't put the game down because each time you play, you uncover new secrets or discover new strategies",Positive
The Developer of this game always listening to their player's feedback compare to the other game. :),Positive
Good improvements compared to the beta. But I'm sure it can be optimized better for battery consumption.,Positive
A fun turn based game filled to the brim with unique and colorful characters. Genshin could never.,Positive
Great quality and all but having problems with audio it doesn't work even with my phone volume maxed out I can't hear it,Positive
"I love this game. Character Design, Combat and Story are nice, so I'm not gonna complain about anything:)",Positive
"It's great like every other HYV games. Except this game keeps crashing my phone, unlike genshin and hi3 they don't really experience this awfully.",Negative
I like this more than genshin because I can afk farm. I don't have to focus on my phone all the time on the go!,Positive

when I log in my game just stop and kicked me out I can't play the game anymore now fix it I am on a phone I have more than enough space for the game,Negative
"Incredibly biased to female units. All the strong meta kits are female, good luck trying to even form a good team with only males",Negative
Game & story line is good but the game will be better if the dev puts in a menu for player uses the item for on going battle.,Positive
"The game is ok, but.... Draw the same person 10 times, or they're just a filler for the completion book... SSDD...",Negative
"After the update double drop rate, Sometime my phone is freezing when i fight the final boss of simulated universe,",Negative
good game + story but no skip and boring event,Negative
Very fun game with decent rewards.,Positive

So much fun. but i think its pretty unfair. that we get 1.6k stellar jades and genshin impact players get 300,Positive
I can't play. I got error code 1001_1. How do I fix this?,Positive
"Very fun, loads of content!",Positive
Boring game.... worst than honkai and genshin. The gameplay is nothing new.. worst part is the story can't skip... you are force to read it.... the gameplay 1 min... story will eat you 30mins....,Negative

"üåüH.S.R by definition is one of the most fun factoring & most generous games Hoyo has to offer, the devs are not very shady & they listen to player feedback instantly well compared to others, possibly the future is growing bright for this game & let's hope ZZZ get's that very same treatment.üåü",Positive
cant get past choosing my character then changing the codename it says to click and hold to verify i click and hold the fingerprint thing and even on my phones print scanner but nothing happens,Negative
Such a amazing game. It's better to have more rewards for log in or more event. May this game success in the future,Positive
My experience has been great so far i hope i get kafka on this version no bugs no major lag spikes i havent encountered anything that ruined my experience.,Positive
Lack of skin tone variety in this game... my little cousin has always been insecure about her skin tone and media like such would only amplify these issues. Absolutely unacceptable of such racism which is also reflected throughout all the games they've made. Disgrace.,Negative

The game looks really fun but I keep getting some 1001_2 error so I wasn't able to play I was working on it for a while still nothing,Positive
"The 50/50 pity is horrible specially when it happens in two banners, it's pretty greedy specially when edilons system that needs dupes already there to make money from, making players lose their hard savings on a stupid 5 stars they don't even like at 90 pulls becuz they lose a pity is simply horrible.",Negative
"Can't play it, it just say log in again to restart. I tried reinstalling it every time but it's always the same. Hope you could fix it.",Negative

"I love this game, it's really fun and the characters designs are so pretty üíûüå∏ but it's too heavy for my phone :(",Positive
The cutscenes for this game is too short it ruins the mood of the player. A month of waiting for less than a minute of cutscenes. Very anticlimactic. Millions of dollars cutscenes that short. I'm now having second thoughts on spending for this game.,Negative
I can't log in on mobile i don't know why its always log in error always. i've already attempted many times still the same problem please fix this,Negative

This game is so unserious that I LOVE IT. Especially the event Aurum Alley's Hustle and Bustle whereas the dialogue in the phone group chat is just funnyüòÇ,Positive
"Yes, Mihoyo make another stinking honkai game which noone cares about and also make an underwhelming boring turn based game when you already made a 3d real time action combat game which was by the way your best rated game so far, but you still treat it as your unwanted child",Negative
"Loved this game so far, i like the turn base battle from this game and the ult animation is very cool to, keep up the great worküòÅüëç",Positive
What a great game! I like the mechanics of skills and combo plus the story line is good! Worth it to play!,Positive
"Another run-of-the-mill gacha game that does nothing unique. Characters all look the same, numbers numbers numbers everywhere. Child characters; and many more stereotypes that appeal to a very brain dead group. All designed to milk people for max money. This review won't deter the masses because spending copious amounts of money on generic anime girls is seen as some sort of bragging right.",Negative
"After almost a year of playing, I can say that this is the most enjoyable gacha game I've ever seen. It's on par or more with Arknights.",Positive
The game is really fun. There is a wide variety of things u can do. There is also many ways for you to get summons :),Positive
i love this game but my internal storage say no,Positive
The game is actually great it's just that since 1.5 the game keeps crashing and it's an issue with Intel driver BC users there is no current solution at the game is just telling us goodbye better devices which is quite unaffordable,Negative

Very generous when it come to Stellar jades. Got free pull every update. Interesting storyline and characters.,Positive

"it is always in ""global distribution error"" even if my data is just fine. i hope they upgrade their servers!",Negative
A lot of fun! I'm still adjusting to different mechanics but it feels like a mix of Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin (which I both love),Positive
"The RNG feels worse than Genshin, i also don't like any of the characters so far at all, the lore is also not very appealing.",Negative
"Please fix the ""too many attempt try again later"" problem it's annoying",Negative
"Amazing, grabs your attention next thing you know it's 5 hours later. Well built game, story, combat, characters.",Positive
Graphics are good. All characters are people of the global minority. Add some different races in it besides white,Negative
one of my favorite mobile games I love it great job üòäü©∑,Positive
"Worst RnG ever, Got yanqing 4 times after losing 50\50, can't i get another character or add some more characters in the standard, I am sick of going at 80 pity and getting same character and remove the LC from the standard they are the major disappointment üòîüòî",Negative

"Yes, this game is pretty good and entertaining, but my problem is i deleted my honkai star rail app not the account itself but when i downloaded it again, a new one was created. Please fix it ASAP and I'll give my 5-star to this game again",Negative
"Absolutely a blast. As someone who enjoys both Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact, I believe Star Rail is a great addition to turn base RPG.",Positive
"Really good game! The combat is slower sense it's turn based, but I still really like it.",Positive
"The game crashes ever other minute, I would like a patch that helps the game run on older phones.",Negative

Perfect just perfect,Positive
Too much lag...,Negative
Actual garbage app that needs to be force closed or restarted if you need to alt-tab even for 2 seconds. Monkey brain development followed by evil predatory FOMO-Generator game design.,Negative

No events for the launch? No end game no multi-player pure single player. This game is like Genshin and is a polished turd.",Negative
There isn't any controller support on Android. I'm not playing until there's controller support.,Negative
"A game that elevates your quality game expectation so much that it's hard to play other gacha games. Now, most of the gacha games I played feels cheap and underdeveloped.",Positive

I play gacha games from the past and even till now genshin was really good but these has to be the best gacha game to ever come out in a few years I spend a certain amount of days play non stop,Positive
Needs optimization for lower end devices. Its sadly jittery with low to high graphics.,Positive
Game is fny to play. Performance is very good for phone (but if you used potato phone is needed to set low graphics for running game),Positive
"The best f2p game I've ever played. I didn't like turn-based games, but HSR is done differently and very enjoyable",Positive
Great game! If it had multiplayer it would be a 5. Either to play with players in PvE or PvP would be fantastic.,Positive

Im getting login errors yet my brother is able to play fine. Ive restarted my game and phone and reinstalled it 3 times! Please fix,Negative
Add the skip button. It's very necessary for people that doesn't have much time to play and don't want to eat all the text.,Negative
I love this game and it's characters with all my life it's really fun especially if you have friends to share the experience,Positive
This game is good it would be better if there was a skip button so I don't have to waist hours clicking to get thorough the millions of cut screens,Positive

Beautifully crafted game with stellar animations and fully voiced characters. A real gem amongst the rubble.,Positive
"I've really enjoyed the story, beautiful graphics too! I've logged so many hours already",Positive
The gacha rate is too damn awful for me I already pull up to 80 pulls I think the only 5 star char I got was from the guaranteed beginner banner.The only reason I give 2 star cause the story is interesting and that all.,Negative
"The game has some major fps drop issue. I have tried on Pc,android and even IOS but still got the same outcome. Please Fix this.",Negative

"Mobile: ASUS ROG PHONE 6 PRO 18GB RAM PC: ASUS TUF Gaming. Max Graphics. Genshin Business Model but in space. Generic story line with generic turn based gameplay disguised with beautiful graphics and big voice acting Japanese casts. Mihoyo literally applied a Genshin Business Model to a turn-based idle-auto character collecting game to supply players with low character pull rates and same pity count. No limited packs and they straight up sell ""primogems"" to players instead.",Negative

"Been a great time, playing casually and not logging in everyday yet still able to somewhat complete content with some difficulty",Positive
I'm addicted. This game is nice to play on my down time. It has a really nice story and the characters are very unique and lovable. <3,Positive
diz was a very good game i mean i was a pro at it but sometimes it doesn't show the teleport option so it becomes sp hrd i got stuck in a map and could not go back idk wut to do so i deleted it but owarall good game üéÆ,Negative
My game is crashing so bad that the environment or background cannot be seen except for the npc and anchor energy.,Negative
"A very good game with so much emphasize on story and even though its turn based, its so much fun to play it",Positive
Very unique game i say it was the best experience I have... because the combination of hoi3 and genshin make it so much things to learn to become powerful,Positive
A visual novel has more interactive features than this game. Its a game for someone who never played any other gacha game and thinks this is okay,Negative
"I really don't play turn-based games, but dang this game proved me wrong. I'm so addicted and in love with this.",Positive
Cool graphics but...4 frames per second and made my phone hot couldn't load and couldn't play.,Negative
This v2.0 game has a lot of problem.. I use high spec device but still keep reconnecting and heating too fast,Positive
I really love this turn base system RPG game. I'm a huge fan of genshin impact and now i love honkai star rail too. The graphics are amazing .,Positive
Alright where is controller support? That rlly couldnt be so hard to implement xd. Idk most reviews so bad. It clearly states its not out yet people 1 star it out of ignorance xD for a gacha game its a great game. Performance is great. U can clear the game without summoning once. Negatives: silent protagonist is ridicolously bland and hate silent mcs. No co pp content whatsoever. No guild system. Well gacha.,Positive
The game is so amazing I love it it's a dream of a game I ever wanted to play amazing graphics and runs smoothly can't ask for,Positive
Really fun game imo especially if you love turn based rpgs. Animation are amazing as well. But it kills battery very fast xD,Positive
"Not gonna lie, i love this game, the music, the storyline, the characters, more updates to come. But would like to see more.",Positive
Eh at best. Fightings basic. Controls are eh. Summon rates are trash like really bad. Says guaranteed fighter at 10 summons. Never saw the first one. Maybe higher summon rates would make it worth something.,Negative
all the game is? is js yapping simulator the combats fun but oh my God is this unbearable and the way it inconveniently closes when you tab out for a minute or two is absolutely bs,Negative
please let me have another chance to switch my choice mc I'm on my knees this game is perfect everything is good just wanna ask some favor to the developers give me one chance to switch my Stella into Caelus please thank you,Positive
"Hot men, hot women, what more could I ask. Also I like the turn based combat more than the genshin combat.",Positive
This is a great game the gacha system itself is more different than the other games based on my experience :3 And I hope hoyo add co-op here.,Positive
"Absolutely love this game. PC version is definitely the best way to play it, but it's nice to have the mobile version if I'm ever away from my laptop.",Positive
I'm giving it a five star for graphics game play and story because the story can play with your emotions that is all keep it up hoyoverse,Positive
4* for now. would appreciate if developers do something about lack relic xp material or add a new calyz for farming.,Positive
"Make story that we can enjoy it with nice story and chill and no ""hard boss"" i hate 1.6 version cause i cant finish the quest cause the enemy too strong please i want to enjoy not try harding",Negative
The game is really fun but i hope more content gets released in future updates because once you enter a high level there's pretty much nothing else to do but pretty sure i would cause the game is still on early developments,Positive
"The only thing this game lacks is the lack of honkai in a game named honkai, hopefully this will change. Until that is adressed this will remain at 5 stars instead of 5 stars",Positive
"I had no problem plyaing the game , but it looks like if it wasn't close world like in the space , it will be good üëç. ( like Genshin impact ) .",Positive
"Still can't play the game I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone, and nothing works.",Negative
I dont know what happening after the update i cant play my stimulated universe its keep lagging and restart my phone however i can play all the event smoothly but its occur when i play stimulated universe when using gerpad and luocha,Negative
"i love it!!, i like story and character!!, but it made me lag and error, but it still good , it made me error btw",Positive
"-Turnbased but with boring and slow mechanics -UI borrow 95% from genshin, really?!! you guys too lazy to make a new UI for a new game -No skip story (lol you overestimated your writing skill) -Characters look like they are just some recycle drafts design from genshit -> a garbage and lazy game from an overtimated developer",Negative
visually interesting. Free to play players can play the game just fine. Actually good story and gameplay,Positive
"My data traffic fr this game so high, almost 2gb/day only fr play this game. Is that normal? How should i fix it? My device infinix note 8.",Negative
16GB update download on mobile AND 21GB update download on Windows... Cool Mihoyo!!! üòá,Negative
Just a straight up good game. It gives you just enough rewards to feel like you actually make progress while playing f2p,Positive
"I am very upset, I spent quite a bit of time and money on this game, only for it to wipe all my data after an update.",Negative
Overall Good game but I didn't like the Combat style...I thought I am playing Card Game in High quality...That turn by turn attacking system It reminds me of ludo...,Negative
One of the worst games I've ever played. Nothing but a huge money grab. And for nothing. No matter how much you progress in the game it's like nothing changes. Don't waste your time.,Negative
"first proper gacha game I play, and it's great. It respects that you have a life outside the game, and it is also very f2p friendly.",Positive
I really enjoyed honkai star rail so far!!,Positive
Love the game. Just the unbelievable amount of grinding can be a turn-off.,Negative
After this latest update. The game stuck on the loading when i doing a mission. I'll hope it fixed really soon because I WANT DANHENG IMBIBITOR,Negative
"very sad, the game has stopped working for me for about a week. (I'm using a Pixel 7) and I've heard nothing back from support.",Negative
"As A Genshin veteran i honestly Enjoy the game, still wish the update came faster~ but overall i love it. Keep up the good work Developer!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
free 5 star at the start of the game üôäüôä it's more fun than genshin and the characters and story is so interesting they're not as stingy either ü§óü§ó,Positive
"A TON of fun!!! Love, LOVE the storyline and character development! Will be playing this for a while :)",Positive
I really hate role playing games. Also it's take like 20 g of phone memory. Hoyoverse is axx. This and g something impact. Takes way too much space in the phone storage. Deleting this now.,Negative
Its pretty good to be honest yep i like this game but i want more male characters because im not a big fan of female characters,Positive
I would have given a 5 star because the game deserves it but I haven't been able to log in all day now what's going on üòï I've tried aso many times but the game doesn't let me log in üò≠,Negative
"download it at pc, my connection lost for a second, it already at 99% and after retry connection the game download the files from 0% ü•∞ what a waste of time",Negative
"I really really love this game because the story your going,trailblazer,super cool heros and so much more. I really appreciate it.",Positive
Great content and good rewards,Positive
Love it and all that characters in it the best so good...,Positive
I love the game but it also makes me want to kms...,Positive
"Battle is very lacking in tactics as you only have basic attack, 1 skill, defend and ultimate.",Negative
"Lame waifu dating simulator, even if you don't like her they keep forcing you to simp for firefly",Negative
"boring as heck, least creative game to ever exist, only carried because of hoyoverse and good rewards because of the bad gameplay that's hardly even a gameplay",Negative
"Its fun and has great characters, but its kinda confusing. That might just be me tho lol",Positive
"Won't let me log into the actual game, and when it comes out on PlayStation please at least give them free 80 pulls as well or at least something because it's fair.",Negative
"the main storyline of the xianzhou luofu is very rushed, poorly written and quite disappointing, but otherwise it is an amazing game",Positive
I like the graphics.... I rate it 4 stars bc of no jump button to make things easier,Positive
"I've been playing this game since it was first released, and I have loved it since. Keep up the awesome work, and I can't wait to see where the story goes.",Positive
Peak game no doubt. :3,Positive
"I am so tired of hearing about this Star Rail game!!! It is so annoying as hell!!! The ads on this game keep spamming me non-stop!!!! All I ever hear is star rail this and star rail that!! Seriously, LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!!!",Negative
Loving this game. Wish it was available for console,Positive
I can't believe this game is not only free but also incredibly generous compared to nearly every other gacha. Couldn't recommend it more,Positive
"What started as a fun, lovely experience has been tainted by a member of the writing staff that thinks it's fun to toy with lore and make a game out of people's feelings towards characters in a way that takes you right out of the story. The recent quest with Jingliu felt off and the comment from weibo from the writer disgusting. It's made playing the game feel uncomfortable. Mostly play on PC so my hours on mobile are few but felt this review needed to be made.",Negative
No controller support. Expects the player to use an on-screen joystick.,Negative
I was Trying to play it for once but I won't load up I tried Different Ways to Make it load but It won't load maybe you devs can fix it??,Negative
"I give it 5 because this game is so good and i love storyline,characters,graphic,maps etc this game is the best for me and i love kafka",Positive
"THIS IS UNEXEPTABLE!!!üò°üò°üò° The game has been super fun so far, but now i keep getting kicked out the game like 10 seconds after starting it- is there a way to fix this? IF NOT THEN I WILL CALL YOUR MANAGERü§¨ü§¨ü§¨",Negative
Why my internet data depleting so fast while playing Honkai Starrail? please fix this issue. Masive ammount internet data depleted in 1 days while only playing starrail on my phone. I don't have any internet data issue while playing genshin. Pleaaasssee fix this isssuuueee!!!!,Positive
Perfect for turn-based rpg fans. Story and characters are interesting. Can't get enough of this game.,Positive
"This is a fantastic RPG, that is unfortunately F2P, and absolutely is held back by its monetization. The Gacha Pulls are laughably expensive, the droprates are pathetic, and the trashy mobile mechanics like Energy suck. Also the arbitrary fps lock to 60 on Non-Apple Products is scummy at best. This includes even the PC version. There is no reason why we consumers should not have this feature, making scumbag design choices because a company paid you is awful for your game quality.",Negative
"Will decide to update this post once the game is released. *UPDATE* HoYoVerse really knows how to handle gamers like me, the music, effects and the playstyle isn't something you'll see and hear everyday and the characters might been reused but who complains? None. That's how special their own characters are. Keep it up HoYoVerse!",Positive
I luv the game!! But the only reason is there's no coop like the other games so I suggest if you could add a coop,Positive
"Great story, great turn base combat, great team strategies, great rewards on events",Positive
Great game with clean graphics and an amazing in-depth lore about the characters and the worlds.,Positive
Bugs will hit you out of nowhere and lock your controls so you have to use the auto battle system.,Negative
"The only reason I gave it 4 star is only 1 reason And thats building problem , trace and light cone needs same material and believe me it's as difficult as hell to build your character !",Positive
"A beautiful game with an equally great story line, game play is fun and easy to learn.",Positive
"This game is awesome üëç I I've recommended to all of my friends and they like it too, üòÇ thank you for the game... it is a masterpiece.",Positive
The game is great the problem was the log in error and bug I hope you can fix it :).,Positive
"The game doesn't load anymore, it always stays stuck on the loading page after like 1 month and a half and even after updates",Negative
fun gameplay and well written characters. I look forward to the new content that will be added :),Positive
"Good characters, fun combat, and is friendly for free to play players like myself.",Positive
"Great game, love the graphics and the story, they fix issues fast, and they listen to their community",Positive
I wouldn't say it's a perfect 10/10 game but it's very good. A lot more generous with freebies than Genshin.,Positive
"like other mihoyo game... finish guest and collect character... but i like this game than genshin impact, its look like genshin more pay to win than this.... too bad no gamepad support",Positive
"Best turn based game... The gacha is really sucks but it's single player game, so you can clear the content with the freebies...",Positive
I play this game every day it is Beautiful the story is amazing the characters are interesting and likeable one of the best games every made,Positive
"They tried really hard to add content, but they forgot to add fun and sense of accomplishment, tons of meaningless red dots",Negative
the game feel abit Boring now & i play maybe 2 or 3 days once (maybe what banner we want delay)... btw Not recommend to Pre Download cause the file not keep save like Mine missing & i need to download back 7gb (20July23),Negative
I reeeaaallly LOVE this game! once i installed it and start playing i cant stop because its so fun.the characters also looks so nice and pretty.i really really recommend this game to tryüëç‚ù§Ô∏è,Positive
Why is the joystick for movement uncomfortably far towards the center of the screen with no way to move it?,Negative
"Uninstall. Why push yourself to play the game that dont even want you to log in. Its a big waste of time to keep finding the reason why, i never experience this error on genshin. Why this game under the same dev team is so complicated. So annoying.",Positive
This is a good game and to anyone else that says it is laggy on a good running phone/etc it's because you have to download the files first then it won't be laggy anymore,Positive
"Turn based games and have a 'Genshin Impact' storyline, graphic, gameplay lookalike = Best Games!!!",Positive
Good game. But I want it to be support on low end device. My device always crash the game.,Positive
"Could be fun, but there does not seem to be controller support. If the only way to play it aggravates me, that's kind of a nonstarter.",Negative
"Very great game to be honest at first, now its boring, i only do dailys/burn fuels and play SU every reset, plz add more quest or companion missions",Positive
The game is actually getting better and better but there's some minor problem is the storage problem and the fps problem,Negative
i thought i wouldn't like a turn-based game but i've been playing this ever since its release and loving it so far! kafka the love of my life...,Positive
Please fix the issue about the inconsistent and weak log in on my account even though I have a strong internet but I can't log in perfectly,Negative
The new update is just worst the enemy's are now incredibly hard. I can't even defeat them with my level 80 character and the Gacha is even worst,Negative
"Amazing!! Especially the jokes XD I just love the gameplay, I play Genshin myself and honestly idk which is more better. But I honestly do love both.",Positive
I mean it's good and all but after since the latest update came out its been giltching a lot and I keep getting the 1001_1 error or what ever it is,Positive
"Good gameplay ,good story",Positive
Every time I try to log in and play the game it won't load it keeps saying login error 1001_3 any ideas on how to stop it?,Negative
The best RPG in mobile phone by far. A nostalgic turn-based battle and amazing story line.,Positive
"Just wish the energy refilled faster- without the same exploration of Genshin, we need to be able to do something until next story patch.",Positive
"Pretty good overall game, good combat mechanics, an interesting story so far and not p2w from what I have played.",Positive
"I love this game but I've been having troubles logging in recently, I'm stuck at the Starting screen, can you send me some help?",Positive
I love this game but I just downloaded it but I went I wanna try playing it. I always stuck at the loading screen :(,Negative
"It's a good game but after the recent update, I can't play the game, it always resets and go back to my home screen",Negative
After i found the reason why the game won't let me into my account. I updated the game review to be higher because of it. But it should increase character chances that you actually wanted by 15%.,Positive
"This game is so good.From the graphics,play style and character design is superb.also f2p friendly too,I can't wait for penacony",Positive
It stopped working after sometime :/,Positive
A high production value game fitting for the honkai name. The turn based nature of the game also makes it very fitting for a friendlier mobile experience,Positive
Amazing character design!! üíó,Positive
"This game is very fun and exploring, a lot of stuff are detaild great and the missions are fun!",Positive
Its a beautiful game . But it is a console like game so make sure you have tons of room to play it.,Positive
"Man, I wish I could play if I could get pass the loading screen keeps giving log in errors like ""Error code: 1001_3"" like what am I doing wrong",Negative
"Overall I think this is a good game, the game also very detailed & hoyoverse really pull they soul into this. All I want to say is I like it (^v^‚Å†‚òÜ‚ô°)",Positive
"Cant log in, ERROR CODE:1001_1 Nov 6,2023 and this error is still there since day 1,whatever network i use,mobile data or wifi,its always like this everyday.",Negative
"One of the best gacha games to excist better than their counterparts genshin,keep up the excellent work in the future patches also.",Positive
"Amazing game, Genhin could never, but I would be nice if the combat flowed better and faster at 1x speed cus 1x feels like 1.5x",Positive
"The game was fun while the content lasted, but now there is nothing to do even though the patch just dropped.",Negative
Love the game. My only complaint is giving us some daily energy like maybe 2-3 time a day would be nice.,Positive
Game freezes after I go to fight some robot character through sliding doors .I reset tried again and still freezes right when ultamit stack is activated,Negative
the game is difficult to play on my mid range device the sky will glitch out cutscenes have issues like being slow audio during cutscenes are choppy,Negative
"I am very angry now because he has re-requested to download the game data for the fifth time for no reason and I do not have enough internet to download them If this problem persists, I am isolated, knowing that my friends faced it",Negative
This is genhsin impact if they did the fusion dance with any turn base rpg also the tutorial felt like a chore it was so bad only reason to play is mistplay gave me points towards a gift cards,Negative
"Amazing game with high quality graphics and intriguing characters! I love it,thank you!‚ù§Ô∏è",Positive
"You should always love anything by Mihoyo that has the word 'Honkai' in it, because they are well made and actually care. leaving it 1 star becasue they only make good 'Honkai' game not good game in general",Negative
It is insane how well it optimized. I enjoyed it as much as PC version on my 6 year old device.,Positive
love this game a lot! the story is amazing and it's easy to understand as well also there are lots of memes!,Positive
"Weak turn based gameplay, and a story that isn't good enough to take itself as seriously as it does. Just focus on honkai 3rd, it's the only decent thing you people have made.",Negative
Good adventure and smooth play on mobile,Positive
The game is very very good but the game need Android good . and I need collab anime One piece or another anime . and the game have PvP?,Positive
This game is fun..but can u fix the express supply pass.. imagine when u are so busy and don't have a chance log in. Then u say that the unclaimed will not be redistributed. Sorry but I won't spent my money anymore.,Negative
Even though it's only been a day this game is so fun and I trust that hoyoverse will be able to keep it fun Edit: they are keeping it fun. L+dr. Ratio to HSR haters,Positive
I like this better than Genshin because it doesn't really take up my time in searching for materials and all that.,Positive
Overall an enjoyable experience. Hope the main story updates won't be too long.,Positive
Finally a mobile game you can run on your phone at the highest quality without it getting choppy with every step you take.,Positive
"Fun gameplay,Good animations, nice music,Story is really fun,Main character isnt silent. UI is nice",Positive
"Grinding are worse and enemies are unfairly strongüòî (I'm not P2W player, and this game just need a lot of grinding which waste a lot of my time but still loseüëé)",Negative
Animations are nice but it's gacha doodoo. Like being on a treadmill as opposed to going places. Edited for profanity :),Negative
Im quite overwhelm but it was fun game. Im just confused i got a new hero on warp. But its not on my character list.,Negative
Feels like Genshin Impact all over again. The gotcha aspect of pulling dozens of characters and not getting anyone worthwhile gets old so fast. üôÑ,Negative
Literally way better than Genshin Impact. Really love the quality of life included in the game and every update is quite a stunner.,Positive
Please Devs!! Fix the map textures cuz im having a trouble where to goüíÄ i would really REALLY APRECIATE IT,Negative
I can't login bruhh. It say login error occurred error code 1001_2 bruhhh was so excited for this game . All people from NA and euro getting logged in but me from Asia couldn't. Fix it fast,Negative
I've never loved a game as much as I love Honkai: Star Rail really. The storyline is just perfect and so are all the characters and lore,Positive
I got the new 5 star character and it heal my team but Clara the boss one is hard my team keep die and I level up them and it still cannot deafeat is hard so I farm some exp and I wanted to get another 5 star game can you give me a 5 star pls so I can be strong to deafeat Clara the boss I want idk welt?,Positive

"I only downloaded this, so I can leave a negative review. I'm tired of seeing 100 ads about this game, when I want to watch something else on YouTube. I don't care about your game! Stop polluting my brain with your stupid ads!",Negative
"Really like the turnbased game like this, mind if there is a chance to make it 5 playable character than 4 considering for the gameplay",Positive
"It's good gameplay experience, but they didn't give me the 80 for downloading the app from an ad.",Positive
"Pretty good game, my main game for a while now. Been enjoying it, even the story and i am someone who skips most of it.",Positive
I literally waited for a million years on teh loading screen and qhen it was about to finish it just went to my home screen ans when i open the app it wont load how cool,Negative
I don't really like the fighting style because you have to wait your turn just to attack but overall it's pretty good,Positive
storage.can you make it as if like in genshin you can delete past quest resources and data which is no longer needed? pls I want to play hsr but also other games,Positive
I HAVE a s22 Ultra and the game keeps crashing? I can't go pass the loading screen what is this!,Negative
Excellent gameplay n story...,Positive
Best game Hoyoverse made so far. It has Genshin Impact level quality while being rather generous with premium currency. Banner rates are more favorable than genshin and auto battle make it less time consuming.,Positive
It ain't a bad game I just wanted Kafka and didn't get her. No mommy=I will kms,Positive
Love it am a day one player so good,Positive
Still same update and performance drop become force close üò≠üò≠ I lost technique start over again but my point tech not comeback...fighting bosses become harder,Negative
I didn't get Acheron so 1 star. Will update this to 5 star if I get her.,Negative
I like everything so far except Stimulated universe and how much RNG it take to get the pathing to selected and Herta shop don't even solve that problem I hope it like honkai how you can buy blessing & upgrade your blessings w/o waiting for the last floor,Positive
It won't even let me download it on ipad,Negative
I would give boothill the sloppiest toe curling head üòõ,Positive
Battle hungry with cool design characters and each twist in the story makes this game more better after each update.,Positive
"Screw this game, 3 consecutive 50/50 loses, I'm quitting.",Negative

"miHoYo, please move some people who are in charge of character designs in Genshin to HSR's team, most characters in the game are an eye sore, too overstimulating, details makes no sense except for the Trailblazers, Luocha, Ruan Mei, Qingque, Himeko, and Welt. I cannot stress enough how this is the same company who made the iconic Ganyu, Albedo, Zhongli, Hu Tao, Klee, Neuvillette, Nigguang, and Navia which are pleasing to look at despite tiny details and aysmmetry that makes sense.",Negative
Best game for all worlds,Positive
please always give me win 50%/50% and 75%/25% when doing gacha,Positive

The Quality and Story line issss wayyy better than Honkai impact 3rd but I hope the Past storyline cut scene is a bit like Genshin impact And there's a question I would like to ask The Crystal fountain I belobog is black for no reason and when herta uses her Burst Her diamond too is black colour,Positive

Stop giving me freaking ads for this I have no storage I don't want it I don't want engine impact I don't want any of these Gothic games,Negative
It's awesome but if you create auto button for run.so rpg turn based gamers become so happier,Positive
hoyoverse constantly participates in cultural appropriation in their other games and has cast a self-admitted sexual abuser as the voice of an upcoming character (chris niosi as the voice of moze). If they continue to do nothing about these issues I'll likely never play or spend money on a hoyoverse game again.,Negative
lacks diversity in skin tones and colors. i don't want white washed and poorly themed characters!!!!,Negative

"I love this so far! The story is interesting, the characters are fun, and the humor is charming. This has quickly become one of my favorite games!",Positive

even tho its a trashy game cuz of my relic rolls atleast this game is better than genshin..but i already stop playing both games!!& waiting for wuthering waves to be officially release in global bcuz i hear that game is better than this two.,Positive
A feeling of nostalgia for old weebs who love turn based games from ps1 & ps2 era. Already good but could be even more epic.,Positive
"Horrible game I can't even play its stuck on the ""checking data updates "" screen üòí 0 stars do not recommend üòí and the downloading process is soooooo long.",Negative
Why does my environment keep disappearing it's like I can see outside the map and the ground and buildings just turn invisible all the time,Negative
Good game. i just hope that we also have a room in the Express which we can customize somehow the wy we want to,Positive
If the game play was like GenShin Impact then You're on to something. People like hands on games. Not games you have to wait for the next move. Keep it Honkai üíØ,Negative
I LOVE THIS GAMEEEE!!! it's so addicting and perfect for me because i'm busy and autoplay is so convenient for me the story is also awesome üòé <333,Positive
It's so annoying when I install it and finish updating and restarted the game the screen is just the train moving in the space,Negative

"Best game evaaaah!!! But the relic set grinding systems is so low, well at least I love the overall gameplay",Positive
Its like turn based genshin. except here you can 2x spd and autoplay. even without autoplay the gameplay is boring.,Negative
(Lag in cut scenes) Game is running smooth 30 fps on my realme 11x but during cut scenes there is too much lag. I hope future update patches fix these issue.,Positive

"I arleady warped 2-3 times in the departure warp (yesterday), but when I logged in back, it only recorded the first 10 warp (10/50).",Positive
One of the best Gacha games out there. I also love its turn-based gameplay and its autoplay feature.,Positive
I really like the game and it's gameplay but i wish it have multiplayer or co-op mode too. I played both honkai and genshin.,Negative
"This game seems to genuinely be aiming for the titles ""best gacha game"" and ""best f2p gacha game"" and I wholeheartedly believe that it is fully worthy of that title, since the day it launched I have not felt disappointed by it ONCE",Positive
"At first I went ""oh I'm not playing no weeaboo game"" to now ""my acheron is undefeatable and I'm blitzing through these enemies, this is addicting""",Positive
Game keep crashing for some reason with me,Negative
"Great game, it's mostly like genshin impact but turn based and has a space theme like honkai impact. Worth playing üëç",Positive
I've been looking for a good rpg to play and I love genshin impact so when this came out the current device that I had at the time so I got a new one and it was campatable so I immediately got it and I love it.,Positive
In most gacha I skip the story. But this one's executed well in that it's fun and not annoying.,Positive
Best Game I have ever played! Graphics are smooth and beautifully rendered.,Positive
Game is just a money grabbing scheme game style is OK character development is slow unless you want to spend money as for the characters themselves good luck,Negative
"Even though the game has not been fully out yet, the starting menu looks very cool as a train is on space going inside a hole thing which i do not know but its still cool",Positive
"Is this normal to be laggy? All i did was download the game and the other stuff and now im trying to ""play"" its only stuck on the loading screen.",Negative

"Im sorry,but when I finish downloading and my game restarts,I can't even play it! Please Hoyoverse fix this.",Negative
"The most disguting and greedy game developer and publisher of all time. The gacha system and pity rate, both are so evil. The first time I have ever rate the game like this.",Negative
best mihoyo game!,Positive
Unplayable sound is just awful lots of popping and cracking and super slow as well.,Negative
Crashed when fighting that beetle weekly boss. (Update: Game keep freezes alot.),Negative
"Definitely not a game for mobile phones, my phone is new, not a high performance one but still pretty good, could barely access because too laggy, i'll try it on pc tho!",Negative
"I personally liked the game. The reason i gave 2 stars is because gacha rate is 0.6% Excess pay to win. Those who say ""There is no pvp in the game, so game is not pay to win"" do not know what pay to win is. No ideal game for F2P players.",Negative
Good turn based games. Lots of interaction. You can also get a gold chunk of trash. 10/10,Positive

"Easily done f2p, very entertaining, fresh and surprisingly good humor! Plenty of nudges towards movies/games/animes!! Trashcanganggang",Positive

Very fun gameplay experience that I would recommend to my friends but the game has become too large for my phone :(,Positive
The following is intended to be high praise It's literally just trails its like Tio's Wet Dream or something the combat the style it all just feels so good,Positive
"Really fun and the story's great. Also, Genshin players being so jealous and angry makes me happy. (I am married to like half the characters btw)",Positive
"Ban pre download games!!! To make it worse after it wasted 7Gb memory on my phone for 3 days its a turn base combat system, you should fire immediately whoever made that poor choice to prevent further bad decisions, game deleted.",Negative
"Unfortunately graphics look nice but it was so laggy on my phone (S21+), I couldn't play it.",Negative
Graphics are amazing but they lied about character customization you get a dull character with a bat really annoying they hyped it up like they did just to be disappointed,Negative
"Please fix the crashing bug, it always disrupts my game play, this started happening after ver1.2 update Please fix this",Positive
It's an absolute favorite of mine. Has been from the beginning of release üíú The game is just incredible.,Positive

"Incredible game, story, animations, characters, all of it. If your a genshin fan, here's your game.",Positive
Hsr > genshin Here is why: 1. Free 10 pull every update 2. Better gacha system 3. Pompom isnt as annoying as paimon 4. Great comedy even in easter eggs 5. Every character has an ult animation 6. The auto play function is incredible 7. Doesnt need as much storage 8. A SKIP BUTTON IF U FAIL A BOSS 9. Incredible art 10. Sm effort into every quest.,Positive
"Overrated game with same concept from Genshin Impact and some other gamea, basically a RESKINNED game with ZERO INNOVATION designed for milking our money with extremely expensive IAP and abyssimal gacha rate. This game will die on next month and players will forget it sooner than forgetting your EX. Why not trying to make something better with new playstle and experience instead of reskinned existing games without any brainwork at all???",Negative
Love the game and I've recommended it to others who like turn based combat games with great storys,Positive
"This game is awesome. At first the turn based combat threw me off, but eventually I got used to it and it's actually a lot of fun.",Positive
The game content is too difficult. Especially the new boss that you HAVE to defeat for the story quest without it you can't do the event or anything. That boss is impossible to defeat without 5* sustains.,Negative
This game is amazing!!! ü§ßü§é This game also is friend of people who can't waste money in the games!! Thank you who create this beautiful game!! üôåüèΩ,Positive

Would give 4-5 stars but story content release is minimal and power creep based upon latest character release shows me a cash grab and no investment worthy characters.,Negative
"Untill it gets a real controller support(yes!For all controllers, not just to 1 or 2) it stays at 2 star.",Negative
"Average of average, mihoyo reminds me of Ubi, they once impressed me with a plate of fried rice, and they fry the same ingredients again again and again. BORING",Negative

"Almost 1 year since first installing this game. Overall I enjoyed it all. Story, Chara, Gacha, Gameplay, Events, everything feels right. Hope that Anniv event won't be disappoint like Genshin did.",Positive
Hello I was a fellow genshin player... Well I play hsr now cause GENSHIN disappointed me. .. Well that's it tbh it's a good gameüòÅ,Positive
Because it's so fun,Positive
I really felt like Mihoyo was too ambitious with Genshin and the previous Honkai. I'm happy to see they're reigning it back and making generic idle auto-battlers now.,Negative
"Pls fix the cutscene it's very lag üò≠, im using Samsung A32 sm-a325f/ds. If it's fixed or slight lag I 5 star it",Positive
So far it's a unique experience. Would be better if it allowed or supported controllers,Positive

"Once you get to a certain point, there is little motivation to do anything more. Kinda pointless game if you ask me.. Story is boring, voices are overblown in the English department and overall its nothing but another gacha game. Typical from the folks who made Genshin Impact. Greedy lot of ya.",Negative

Very beautiful game has a nice story but the common gacha problem drop rates are garbage .. though I have to admit even the 4 star are very viable amazing job Mihoyo,Positive
I'll give zero stars if there is one since the drop rate on new characters are the same with gensin impact which is zero percent. This game is for whales of genshin impact I don't recommend this game if you have played genshin impact.,Negative

"Nice and all, it's just that the story is really mid,, the lore and all is just not my thing but gameplay wise it's so cool",Positive

For some reason it keep kicking me out of the app and it's literally so annoying when I'm fighting with enemies like wth,Positive
"To put it straight, it was fun, but it took forever to download the data.",Positive
"Nice game and relaxing game. If Genshin Impact is 70% action and 30% dialogue, this game is the oposite 30% action (maybe less) and the rest is just dialoge and cutscene.",Positive
Playing a game but it is like watching an anime or reading a manga. Pure entertainment!!,Positive
It's fun and has many eye catching characters that each have different weapons and personalities I would recommend,Positive
The loading takes so long!!,Negative
Its really Nice! But when i fight the boss with high.. i cant even cus of low level also kinda hard to fight..,Negative

I love this game. Honestly my favorithe character is Seele she is really strong however i had trouble beating cocolia but i did it THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS GAME!‚ù§‚ù§,Positive
Good game in general however I dont like that most of the time I need to talk to NPCs before some action I get me bored easily honestly.,Negative
The best mobile game I've played so far. I am really invested in the story which is rare for me especially for mobile games.,Positive
A great game with wonderful quality. Not a fan of the racist undertones. Hopefully all the villains will be punished accordingly.,Negative

I like fight games. you should know why did I delete this game bc there's no co-op like genshin. but I like the way that you get 5 stars characters very easy,Negative
"Very nice, If you leave the game but keep the app open mid dialog the game freaks out, just a heads up.",Positive

"Beech when i arrived at the underground, after that girl witht he puple hair talked i was roaming around and when u came back to the spot where my teammates where. THEY.WERE.GONE.LIKE.AANGS.KIND. LIKE I HATE THIS GLITCH I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU",Negative
Maybe Make It so That Low end devices can still handle the storage that this game had. Good game though but The storage is competing with genshin and Codm,Negative
the game lacks of content. you literally just open the game. do daily mission and spend your stamina on traces and ascension upgrade.,Negative

I absolutely love the game I just wish there were more ways to obtain more tickets faster and without spending so much Crystals/rl money,Positive

Game is super fun! I really recommend good playable characters style and unique phonecases! And it has a lot of easter eggs in which i love,Positive
"I love how fun it is and how touching the lore is, but the fact you nearly HAVE to pay to get good characters is... Yikes.",Positive
"Too much story. Played for what felt like 5 hours, 4 if which was story. Dude. I want to pay a game not watch a show",Negative
"Fun and fullfilling time taker, gives out rewards genoursly each and every month, and just improving each and every patch!",Positive
"The lack of true RNG is scary. it honestly is using a card system, and it ruins the fun for someone like me.",Negative
"From what i've seen, the gameplay looks really fun and the character designs are also so unique and pretty :DDD (totally not down bad for kafka)",Positive
Best game I ever played but it's taking too much storage I hope this gets fixed üóø,Positive

I purchased the daily rewards but it failed once and when I tried again it was successful but I got deducted twice,Negative
"So far so good, i'm temporarily ignore the gacha since i like to free 2 play. The game vibe feels like playing xenosaga, xenoblade and star ocean at the same time.",Positive
Free Dr ratio ü§©ü§©ü§© update 2.0 has amezing story and map mechanism to fight new enemy .. if possible I would have given 10/5 star it's just that good,Positive
"Made it far in the game, then one day the game decided to restart the story on me and I lost all my progress.",Negative
"My game crashed but it was connection issue, the game run really smooth on my pc. (Edited)",Positive
"Played from day 1. Story wise, it's a blast. Sadly, even 1 year has passed, Devs keep nerfing male unit before release. Male chara are ""subpar"" all around. Their damage-maximised output have to be paired to (harmony) unit, which is a female chara too. So The game is heavily centered around Female units to be meta. I hope they can balance out the performance for each gender units. Man, We deserve what we pay. Look, how Male units are so few & nothing special compare to Female units. Sadge",Negative
Good game but a little bit of a grind for resources it's really hard to play but the storyline is good,Negative
Why you didn't release this game on consoles is beyond me you dropped the ball hard I give this 3 stars only because I play hour or less and my phone start burning out you can literally start a fire,Negative

Never get it. It kept giving me adds after I got it and it's so boring just one story line chose herta not the express I waited for 1 hour but nothing happened üòí I expected more,Negative
"Can't even play the game it always say when my loggin in ""error login failed please try again later"" i dont have a problem in my internet pls fix this",Negative

"I like the facts that they made it like the persona 5.. the battle system, it has really good Characters as well just like genshin 10/10 ‚ú®‚ú®",Positive
exploration + turn based just doesn't work for me. also sceneries are disappoiting which is the worst part for me.,Negative
"No, I havent played the game yet, but its because it takes FOREVER to load! It takes like, an hour. Im pretty sure the game is good, but im upset because I cant play it",Negative
"Nice game turn base , 7Ds grand cross and the other might be good but star rail has it own style with nice plot and characters",Positive
"Amazing game, the music, story writing, immersion, it is just on point!",Positive
Would be nice if something like skip tickets or something could be implemented to make grinding easier the power spike in newer content is rough,Positive
It's a great game and i hope that it will continue to be an f2p friendly..but for sure it will not..ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇüòÇ,Positive
"Game is good, but it doesn't need to take up almost 70Gb of space...",Negative
Gives a limited character for free meanwhile genshin can't even make a good anniversary for 3 years strait. Amazing game,Positive
"The game is really good, very good indeed yet can you pls put some more quest and make it easier to obtain stellar jade?",Negative
So far the best game created by Hoyoverse in terms of F2P friendly! The dev did READ our critics and IMPLEMENTED to the system! The game didn't only give us 3 wishes for our full support for 3 years! They acknowledge our presence well :) Love u HSR!,Positive

"Not bad Still waiting on the 80 free pulls they advertised on youtube, just says 80 free pulls but not what you need to do to get them hopefully its not a scam to get you to play Will see how the story unfolds",Negative
The game is as fun on the pc as it is on mobile definitely recommend plus auto battle makes the game easier if your working and your on that mat grind,Positive
"It's very difficult to get any character 5 five stars, if you want to get someone you need to use all stellar jade",Negative
"nice turn base but with no coop function other than lending character kinda let down, but for the side lore are good especially about trash can its funny",Positive

"Amazing content, design, player engagement and turn based gameplay.",Positive
This is an amazing app where the devs as actually care about player feedback. Genshin could never.,Positive
This game is great. The main reason this has so many 1 star reviews is because people just don't like that this is turn based game. It has a great story and a fun game play,Positive

"It's a fun and relaxing game... the characters are great, and just enjoy to play..",Positive

"It's a great great game! From Hoyoverse, another epic adventure in universal scale! Highly recommend!",Positive
I love turn based! Just that we are unable to jump and add coop in the future,Positive
Combat is super boring. I understand starting characters should not have high damage but seriously underwhelming dmg. Even after I got the free 5 star even he was weak and didn't have any books to improve xp.,Negative
A very promising game and you can play at your own phase which you do not need to make so much time in the game and balance with your life.,Positive
phgmgohgosjfffn this game has been my hyperfixation since GOD KNEOS when (I love this game so much ohmgyod),Positive
Really great game. I would definitely recommend this,Positive
A boring sequel (?) Of honkai impact 3rd but I'll rate it 5 star cus I love the honkai series and they finally make another honkai game after 6 years,Positive
Login error keeps happening after the recent update,Negative
"Gatcha rates are garbage, lost 50-50 6x in a row. Also always end up needing to do hard pity to get new characters.",Negative
fun game. resourse is low else no problem.. the story makes me sobbbüò≠,Positive
Good game but only three stars cuz I keep getting ads for this game everywhere and it annoys the hell out of me,Negative
"Don't even know why there is no 120 fps support on android, hopefully devs will consider to implement the type of optimization that apple products experience to android as well.",Positive
Stupid game gave me bailu 2 times. Uninstall waste of time. Can't even fast forward the boring storyline.,Negative
I never spent so many hours on a game before. This game is really fun!!,Positive
"As a burned out genshin player, redownload this game after a year is absolutely W...play like 9 hours straight lol",Positive
playing this on pc but leaving a review here. the mechanics and graphics are cool esp knowing trails and other inspos. they do work quite well & you can see that is where the devs passion lies. but now here is where the critique comes: rpgs can live or die by their narrative. sumeru > this game so far. & making a conflict with eurocentric poverty & russian themes & having it have messages akin to a wet fart in a post pathologic and disco elysium is yikes. I could rant more but 500 limit lol,Negative
Story can be much better. Overall a good game for turn based fans with high production quality,Negative
Always get hard pity yanqing 80+ srsly?,Negative
"Nice game like good graphics, and it is not like genshin, which my phone dies to it . Love it . Strategy .",Positive

I used but I'm sure I used my google account but when I log in, it's not my account. I already emailed my problem but no one seems to be replying to any of my emails. Please fix this.",Negative
"I have a problem with this game I can't even log in, because everytime I try to log in, it always shows the error and I can't play it because of it",Negative
Now this is called a gacha game Little lag here and there. Not smooth as genshin in mobile. But oke need a little boost up work on the game. Other than that. Worth it.,Positive
Okay so I find myself having to change my review and stars because Hsr has given me 8 5 stars in a total of 170 pulls? Around that.,Positive
This game so good but the updated its so slow and far can you fix this thank you,Negative
"I really like the game, it's super immersive and has good drop rates in gacha, so it's pretty fair towards f2p players.",Positive
It was okay gameplay but I feel like the overly suggestive physics is what gives all the good reviews. (Jiggle physics),Negative
"Been enjoying it so far. This is the first game I've played from launch, hoped I can consistently follow the game. Really interested where mihoyo would take this game to üòÅ",Positive
"Great game. I very much like it, but um, I kinda don't have any quest to do right now. I kinda just do my daily stuff, and then I get bored",Positive
"Hello, umm, I don't know how to say this, but my Dan heng model isn't showing up properly, and I was wondering if you guys know how to fix it? Great game love it",Positive

"so much better than genshin, it rewards more and you dont have to do a million things for the smallest reward",Positive
"The new 'if you can't stop leakers join them' mentality is straight up insanely. And by giving access to choosen content creators to leaks not only the company's reputation is going to go down, but the content creators that weren't choosen will loose their chance to compete, which leads to them leaving the promotion of the game. Thus far this was the worst decision made by you, and by seeing content creators that i love loose their livelihood, i lost hope in hoyoverse in it's whole.",Negative

"The game has too much too ask, for me it always says ""too many requests. PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER"" I have waited for a long day but still I can't log in to the game.",Negative
I've been playing since release and it is a very solid gacha that is quite generous to F2P/low spenders.,Positive

Just a fun turn based game and I highly suggest if you have a strong enough phone for it.,Positive

"Where's the darn skip option? You think I am gonna go through the story just because you forced me to? I'm not interested in your long winded grandma stories that looks like you tryna hit the minimum 1000 words on your essay when you could've get straight to the darn point.

I'm a spender and this gacha definitely makes me not want to spend money. I spent quite a bit in NIKKE and AFK because it felt like you could actually get something. Gacha is whale territory only I think.,Negative

Pity is 90 rolls, guaranteed banner on 2nd with 50/50 chance. 1260 rolls for just a C6 character, biggest deal is 8080 gems for 100$ meaning it's 2500$ for a C6 banner. To get a rank 5 light cone is also 900 rolls, being around 1800$. To get a fully maxed out banner is 4300$ They need to drop the price, drop the amount of pity, or drop the 50/50. 50/50 would drop it to half and more accessible to everyone.

Same issue with Genshin. Character that already released for along time never gonna make it to the standart banner. People has to wait for eons for the banner so undevisive gacha schedule. And also Eidolons feature is so unfair and not balance between character in the same rank. Its dumb and good to know that the dev is not listening to majority. Only prioritise income by fooling players. And after tha game kinda dying proceed to release another tittle with the same dumb gacha and dupes system,Negative
